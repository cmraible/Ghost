<p>This was one of those weeks that made very clear the work we are doing is having a real impact, but that as a whole, our country remains on a very dark timeline.</p>
<p>The good news — <em>The Daily Poster</em> got <a href="https://thebulwark.com/biden-must-stiff-arm-the-court-packers/">attacked</a> by one of the major right-wing websites for daring to articulate the case for why Joe Biden and Democrats should support expanding the Supreme Court. So that’s some solid proof that the far right sees us having impact and sees us as a threat.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was on one of the fastest growing new podcasts to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-11-law-42769208">discuss</a> our reporting on the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, none other than <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnWDean/status/1317260394709176320">John Dean</a> publicly touted our work and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/climate/amy-coney-barrett-climate-change.html">New York Times</a> followed up our reporting that broke open the big story of Amy Barrett’s familial link to an oil company that has a major climate case before the high court.</p>
<p>The bad news: the largest fire in the history of Colorado is currently bearing down on my community, and we just finished up a week that saw Republicans move forward with their plan to install another climate change denier on the Supreme Court, as Democrats basically surrendered. Oh, and most of the media spent far more time on emails about Hunter Biden than on a climate crisis that threatens all life on the planet.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to really say anymore, or where to look for sanity. When I log onto social media, I see a completely deranged society — there are right-wing MAGA trolls, and there are Brunch Liberals who spend their days glued to MSNBC and then posting their demands for retribution against progressives and former Bernie staffers, as the entire world burns.</p>
<p>Politics has become both disconnected from the world we all live in and genuinely psychopathic — and I find more and more days in which I wonder how much longer I will even be involved in any of this. The whole thing feels like a complete farce.</p>
<p>But then I spend time with my <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1317508593210384385?s=20">children</a> and see my partner Emily canvassing for reelection in our community, and I remember that giving up is not an option — at least not yet. It’s why I’ve been spending 80 to 100 hours a week on trying to build <em>The Daily Poster — </em>because part of the solution is going to be grassroots-funded media that doesn’t have to answer to corporations and billionaires, and that can therefore try to spread the truth of what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>If we had a whole newsroom of reporters, we could make an even bigger impact than we are making now. I keep that vision in mind when I wake up every day and do this work, and I thank all of you for pitching in and being part of the team. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>

The headline on the Times’ story was pretty <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1317496724747964417?s=20"><em>pathetic</em></a> — but it was good that the newspaper at least did a story.</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://theflashpoint.substack.com/p/of-course-trump-will-face-no-consequences"><strong>Of Course Trump Will Face No Consequences</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Flashpoint) — <em>We are watching the beginning of the predictable effort to preemptively exonerate Donald Trump and make sure he and his administration faces no consequences for their crimes.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159766/supreme-court-designed-kill-climate-policies"><strong>This Supreme Court Was Designed to Kill Climate Policies</strong></a> (New Republic) — <em>“The future Supreme Court, and the 6–3 conservative majority that now seems imminent, won’t just be empowered to overturn Roe v. Wade, as many are focusing on this week. It will also likely rule on the most important components of any prospective climate action: any new <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063715859"><em>attempts</em></a> by the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, for example, and the EPA’s leeway to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/climatewire/stories/1063715859/search?keyword=coney+barrett"><em>interpret</em></a> statutes like the Clean Air Act.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democrats-climate-fracking-debate/"><strong>Democrats Should Stop Worrying About Debating Climate Change</strong></a> (The Nation) — <em>“Overwhelming majorities of Americans see it as a win-win to create millions of unionized jobs that build prosperity for all, while transitioning to the clean energy economy of the future. If we keep the focus of the climate debate there, we’ll prevent civilizational collapse. And we’ll probably win some elections, too.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/debt-collectors-have-made-a-fortune-this-year-now-theyre-coming-for-more"><strong>Debt Collectors Have Made a Fortune This Year. Now They’re Coming for More.</strong></a><strong></strong>(ProPublica) — <em>“In recent months, the only real bad news for debt buyers was that local courts across the country temporarily shut down. Debt collection lawsuits provide a key source of revenue for the companies, a way to extract payment from consumers, typically low-income, who don’t offer it up. But now even that hiccup is over. After a bit of a lull in the spring, Encore and other debt buyers are back at it, filing suits by the thousands every week.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/a-biden-administration-needs-racial-diversity-it-should-find-it-outside-corporations-51602595440"><strong>A Biden Administration Needs Racial Diversity. It Should Find It Outside Corporations.</strong></a><strong></strong>(Barron’s) — <em>“Several prominent Democrats have levied the absurd <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/07/biden-diversity-purity-test-409245"><em>charge</em></a> that a ban on corporate executives and lobbyists would hamstring the racial diversity of a Biden Administration…Like many other people of color working around the Beltway, we decry the lack of diversity within departments and regulatory agencies (but) there is no reason to tie the cause of racial justice to the wants of large corporations and those who have lobbied toward those ends.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/10/success/black-homeownership-costs/index.html"><strong>Black Americans Are Paying More To Own A Home And Falling Further Behind</strong></a></strong> (CNN) — <em>“Black Americans pay more than any other group to own a home, a disparity that contributes to roughly half of the $130,000 retirement savings gap between Blacks and Whites…Black homeowners pay more in mortgage interest, mortgage insurance and property taxes than other homeowners.”</em></p>
