<p>The conservative dark money group that led the campaign to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat with Amy Coney Barrett received more than $14 million from a single mystery donor in the lead-up to the confirmation fight, according to documents obtained by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>
<p>The Concord Fund is the new parent nonprofit of the Judicial Crisis Network, a secretive dark money group that has been bankrolling campaigns to install GOP judges and funding conservative advocacy campaigns around the country since 2004.</p>
<p>After Ginsburg’s death in September last year, the Judicial Crisis Network immediately started <a href="https://judicialnetwork.com/in-the-news/jcn-launches-multimillion-dollar-initial-ad-blitz-to-fill-scotus-seat/">spending millions</a> on ads calling on Senators to “ignore the extremists, stick to precedent, and confirm the nominee,” who had not yet been named. The group then spent millions more to <a href="https://judicialnetwork.com/in-the-news/confirm-amy/">support</a> Barrett’s confirmation after former President Donald Trump selected her to replace Ginsburg. </p>
<p>The Concord Fund’s latest IRS tax return shows the organization raised $20.4 million between July 2019 and June 2020. While the group is not required to publicly disclose its donors, the tax return shows it received $14.3 million — nearly 70 percent of its total revenue at the time — from a single anonymous source. The group also received donations of $4 million and $1 million.</p>
<p>The Concord Fund is closely tied to top Trump judicial adviser Leonard Leo. In early 2020, Leo stepped away from his day-to-day role at the Federalist Society, the national conservative lawyers group, to <a href="https://www.axios.com/leonard-leo-crc-advisors-federalist-society-50d4d844-19a3-4eab-af2b-7b74f1617d1c.html">help steer</a> the Concord Fund. Between mid-2019 and mid-2020, the Concord Fund paid $1.6 million to a company <a href="https://maplightarchive.org/story/trump-judicial-adviser-linked-to-1-million-anonymous-inaugural-donation/">affiliated</a> with Leo called BH Group, LLC. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Leo and his allies rebranded the Judicial Crisis Network as the Concord Fund, turning it into a social welfare organization that fiscally sponsors other organizations. This arrangement creates additional layers of opacity, allowing a nonprofit to host or create new advocacy groups at relatively little cost that simply exist as a trade name. Judicial Crisis Network is now a fictitious name registered under the Concord Fund in Virginia.</p>
<p>Conservative operatives did the same thing with the Judicial Crisis Network’s charitable arm, the Judicial Education Project, renaming it the 85 Fund.</p>
<p>Last week, the 85 Fund and the Concord Fund registered new fictitious names, Free to Learn and Free to Learn Action. A few days later, the Free to Learn Coalition, which Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/freedom-to-learn-coalition-critical-race-theory">described</a> as an “anti-critical race theory” organization, publicly <a href="https://freetolearn.org/press-release-free-to-learn-coalition-launches-with-national-ad-campaign-focused-on-taking-politics-out-of-the-classroom/">announced</a> that it had “launched with an initial seven-figure national ad campaign of well over $1 million advocating for classrooms independent from political influence.”</p>
<p>The Free to Learn Coalition’s president, Alleigh Marré, said in the press release that the group “will provide a platform and tailored resources to those ready to take on political activism by school boards and administrators.” </p>
<p>The Concord Fund’s tax return lists big donations to the Republican Attorneys General Association ($766,000), which elects GOP attorneys general and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporations-kept-bankrolling-the-campaign-against-voting-rights/">has pushed</a> to restrict voting rights and overturn the 2020 election, and the Republican State Leadership Committee ($1.1 million), which helps elect GOP lawmakers to state legislatures. </p>
<p>The Concord Fund donated to many conservative dark money groups. The group gave $1 million to FGA Action, the social welfare arm of the Foundation for Government Accountability, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20835692/conservative-think-tank-foundation-for-government-accountability-food-stamps-snap-poverty-welfare">has pushed</a> to kick millions of Americans off of food stamps.</p>
<p>The Concord Fund also contributed $750,000 to Stand for America, a dark money group <a href="https://standforamerica.com/">created</a> by former Trump ambassador and ex-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. It donated $200,000 to America One Policies, a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/07/dark-money-tied-tom-cotton-targets-dems/">dark money group</a> tied to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and $250,000 to State Solutions, the <a href="https://maplightarchive.org/story/oil-and-gas-companies-fueled-attacks-on-colorados-new-democratic-governor/">dark money arm</a> of the Republican Governors Association. </p>
<p>The organization made donations to several dark money groups that pushed for Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation, including the <a href="https://www.clubforgrowth.org/club-for-growth-releases-new-ad-white-paper-on-judge-barrett-and-economic-liberty-2/">Club for Growth</a> ($500,000), the <a href="https://www.sba-list.org/newsroom/press-releases/sba-list-condemns-attacks-on-amy-barretts-catholic-faith">Susan B. Anthony List</a> ($450,000) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-confirmation-article-iii-project-conservative-judicial-group/">Article III</a> ($167,000), <a href="https://m.facebook.com/AmericaRising2/photos/a.1697271457215764/2782580828684816/?type=3&amp;source=48">America Rising Squared</a> ($150,000), <a href="https://www.teapartypatriots.org/support-barrett/">Tea Party Patriots</a> ($150,000), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/amy-coney-barrett-bus-tour-super-spreader-event">Concerned Women for America</a> ($125,000), and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frc-urges-senators-to-confirm-judge-amy-barrett-to-the-supreme-court-301151628.html">FRC Action</a> ($55,000).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>The Judicial Crisis Network has long been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/we-still-dont-know-who-is-paying/">one of the darkest</a> of dark money groups, with nearly nothing known about its donors. However, tax returns show the organization has received <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/473803487/201840469349302304/IRS990ScheduleI">at least</a><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/473803487/202020499349300017/IRS990ScheduleI">$3.2 million</a> in recent years from the 45Committee, a dark money group <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/05/nonprofits-backing-trump-have-deep-swampy-ties/">linked</a> to the billionaire Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs.</p>
