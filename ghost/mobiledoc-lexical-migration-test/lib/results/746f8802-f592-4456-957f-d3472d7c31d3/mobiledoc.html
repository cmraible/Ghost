<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We’ve been making a lot of waves with our accountability journalism — we’re proving that it works. And if we get just a few more free subscribers to become supporting subscribers, we will have the resources to bring on more reporters and expand. We’re thisclose to getting to our goal.</p>
<p><strong>Can you please go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> and become a supporting subscriber?</strong></p>
<p>There’s an <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/08/31/americans-see-skepticism-of-news-media-as-healthy-say-public-trust-in-the-institution-can-improve/?utm_content=bufferc322f&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">important new Pew study</a> out today finding that the “vast majority of Americans (80%) think that the news they get is at least ‘somewhat’ influenced by financial and corporate interests.”</p>
<p>We are building a new model for journalism — we don’t take corporate money, we are funded by grassroots subscribers. That empowers us to publish stories challenging Wall Street and scrutinizing politicians, whether they like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t like spending time asking folks to pitch in — but it is important. Please <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>When you pitch in, it helps us get one step closer to our goal of hiring more journalists to produce stories that make real impact.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
