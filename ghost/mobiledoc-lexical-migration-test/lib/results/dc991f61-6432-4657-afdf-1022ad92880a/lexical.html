<p>Friends:</p>
<p>If you’ve been following our coverage the last few weeks, you know that we’ve been breaking some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-police-reform-stalled-in-ny">big stories</a> about our two-tiered system of justice — and the good news is that we are starting to see powerful politicians <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/protests-george-floyd-nyc-1.45392395">caving under the pressure</a> of a mass movement that is demanding change.</p>
<p>Clearly, we need independent, grassroots-funded media now more than ever — and that’s what we’re trying to build with this journalism project that has already broken big stories on everyone from Republican leader Mitch McConnell to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why I’m asking you to go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber — doing that will help us expand our coverage and scrutinize power.</strong></p>
<p>When I started this project, I wasn’t sure if we could be successful. But over the first two months, we’ve had big successes — and I am more convinced than ever that if we continue growing our grassroots support, we can have even more impact.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering <a href="#/portal/signup">this request to become a supporting subscriber</a> — and for all the work you are doing right now in your communities to fight for a better world.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. Here’s a photo I snapped today while at a student-led march with my son here in Denver. These are dark and scary times — but the displays of solidarity that we are seeing all over America give me hope that we can change things.</p>
