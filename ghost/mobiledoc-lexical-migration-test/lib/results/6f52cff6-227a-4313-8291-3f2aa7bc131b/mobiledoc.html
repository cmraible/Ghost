<p>“American businesses are poised to benefit from twin victories in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, which gives consumers more money to spend but doesn’t force companies to raise workers’ wages.” ― <em>The Wall Street Journal </em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/businesses-count-covid-19-stimulus-package-benefits-11615464019?st=ivsu0f8tdvq9vyf&amp;reflink=share_mobilewebshare">this morning</a>.</p>

<p>Disney backed 96 percent of the Florida Republican state lawmakers who passed a law in 2019 to strip voting rights from 800,000 people, according to a <a href="https://mkus3lurbh3lbztg254fzode-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/song-of-suppression-disney-report-2021.pdf">new report</a> from Public Citizen. In 2018, Florida voters had <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/07/665031366/over-a-million-florida-ex-felons-win-right-to-vote-with-amendment-4">overwhelmingly passed</a> a ballot initiative to restore voting rights to 1.4 million former felons in the state. But in the following legislative session, Florida Republicans effectively enacted a poll tax on those voters, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/01/737668646/aclu-sues-over-florida-law-that-requires-felons-to-pay-fees-fines-before-voting">requiring</a> people to pay outstanding fees or fines before their voting rights were restored.</p>
<p>Disney donated more than $800,000 between 2016 and 2020 to the lawmakers who voted for the legislation as well as Gov. Rick DeSantis, who signed it into law. After the January 6 insurrection, Disney <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/walmart-suspends-donations-to-lawmakers-who-objected-to-election">announced</a> that it would be suspending political contributions to the lawmakers who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>One year ago today, many of us began to realize that COVID-19 was going to drastically change our lives. Read <em>Buzzfeed’s </em><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/buzzfeednews/march-11-covid-tom-hanks-nba-who">oral history</a> of that historic day.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• THE SUPREME COURT’S DARK MONEY PROBLEM: </strong>Last fall, when the GOP was rushing to confirm Amy Coney Barrett before the November election, a single conservative dark money group spent at least $10 million backing her nomination, <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/we-still-dont-know-who-is-paying/">The Daily Poster</a></em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/we-still-dont-know-who-is-paying/"> reported</a> at the time. That same group, the Judicial Crisis Network, has spent tens of millions of dollars backing Republican court appointees, and <a href="https://demandjustice.org/">liberal dark money groups</a> have begun to do the same for their own nominees. Despite the massive influence these groups wield over the Supreme Court, the public has no way of knowing who funds them. Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/03/senate-judiciary-holds-hearing-on-dark-money-and-supreme-court/">held a hearing</a> on dark money influencing Supreme Court nominees, at which they discussed potential disclosure laws.</p>
<p><strong>• STRANDED ASSETS: </strong>This week, the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2021/asyousowexxon010521-14a8-incoming.pdf">sided with</a> ExxonMobil in rejecting a shareholder proposal to require the company to report how it plans to deal with “stranded assets” — untapped fossil fuels that the company is counting as assets but may never be drilled, meaning they will turn into liabilities. If companies don’t plan for the risks associated with stranded assets, they risk bankruptcy, leaving workers <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/158596/fossil-fuel-companies-bankruptcy-bailout">without jobs or pensions</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/fossil-fuel-companies-profited-now/">taxpayers on</a><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/03/senate-judiciary-holds-hearing-on-dark-money-and-supreme-court/">the hook</a> for environmental cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>• FEDERAL UTILITY REGULATORS HAVE NO PLAN FOR CLIMATE CHANGE: </strong>After a winter storm last month left <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/one-texas-storm-exposed-energy-grid-unprepared-climate-change-rcna289">more than</a> 3.5 million energy customers in Texas without power, it was clear that the electricity grid was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/">not prepared</a> to handle the extreme weather events that will become more frequent with climate change. Now <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-346.pdf">a new report</a> from the Government Accountability Office found that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates energy utilities, still has <a href="https://twitter.com/lydiadepillis/status/1369975611284992004?s=20">no plan</a> to prepare the electricity grid for climate change.</p>
<p><strong>• #StopLine3: </strong>Over 370 organizations <a href="https://twitter.com/OilChangeUS/status/1369392365258092547?s=20">are calling on</a> President Joe Biden to halt construction of Enbridge Energy’s Line 3 oil pipeline, which is currently being built through Minnesota. For now, an Indigenous-led resistance movement is <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16022021/biden-line-3-minnesota-enbridge-pipeline-indigenous-resistance/">slowing down</a> the construction process.</p>
