<p>“The truth is the question of whether student debt should be canceled is largely irrelevant. Most student debt will be canceled sooner or later, because an ever-growing share of borrowers cannot possibly repay their loans.” — <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/980889/secret-truth-student-debt-crisis">Ryan Cooper</a>, reporting for <em>The Week</em> on the student debt crisis.</p>

<p>Following President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-us-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan/2021/04/13/918c3cae-9beb-11eb-8a83-3bc1fa69c2e8_story.html">announcement</a> that the United States would be withdrawing all of its troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, more than two dozen anti-war groups sent a letter to the White House welcoming the decision and encouraging Biden to use it as a starting point for a more just foreign policy.</p>
<p>“The practice of endless war damages the security of the United States and causes untold suffering,” read the letter, which was led by Demand Progress, The Quincy Institute and Common Defense. “For these reasons, we support your important decision regarding Afghanistan and encourage you to make this the starting point for a profound reorientation of our foreign policy away from the overextension of military force and toward sustained diplomacy to meet the challenges of the 21st century.”</p>
<p>The signees noted that the administration's Afghanistan decision is backed by the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/552026-poll-two-thirds-support-afghanistan-withdrawal">vast majority</a> of Americans. “Polling after the announcement of the withdrawal decision also reflects the broad support of millions of Americans for the end of U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan,” said Adam Weinstein, an Afghanistan war veteran and research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a U.S. think tank.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Amazon made <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/amazon-and-walmart-halted-hazard-pay-for-workers-despite-making-30-billion/">headlines</a> slashing pandemic hazard pay. Now, <a href="https://www.helpcenterapp.com/blog/revenue-per-employee-amazon-ebay-alibaba/">new research</a> shows the company makes nearly $300,000 of revenue for every worker it employs — and those profits are padded by public money. In all, new data from Good Jobs First shows Amazon has now raked in more than <a href="https://twitter.com/GoodJobsFirst/status/1390358561612521475">$4 billion of public subsidies</a>. It is difficult to know how much more may be in the works, because Amazon has <a href="https://boondoggle.substack.com/p/state-secrets">used its political power</a> to try to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/john-gallagher/2018/04/24/amazon-headquarters-public-subsidies-detroit/542843002/">force</a> local governments to keep prospective subsidy deals secret.</p>

    <li><strong><strong>CORPORATE PROSECUTIONS PLUMMETED AMID THE PANDEMIC: </strong></strong>Amid <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/231fb18b-32b2-4221-864a-c17fd0672ea2">allegations</a> of rampant pandemic profiteering by big companies, federal law enforcement agencies reduced corporate prosecutions to their lowest level in more than a quarter century, according to federal data compiled by <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/corporate-criminals-above-the-law-prosecutions-plunged/"><em>Public Citizen</em></a>. The decline “means that only 94 corporations either pled or were found guilty of crimes,” noted the report. At the same time in 2020, the Trump Justice Department negotiated “45 deferred prosecution agreements and nonprosecution agreements with corporate offenders'' — a 73 percent year-over-year increase.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>TELECOM GIANTS SPAMMED FCC OVER NET NEUTRALITY: </strong></strong>Big Telecom submitted nearly 18 million comments from fake or dead people to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2017 to support the commission’s repeal of net neutrality, according to a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqq7b/big-telecom-used-fake-and-dead-people-to-fight-net-neutrality-ny-ag-says">new report</a> from New York Attorney General Letitia James. Net neutrality rules were first enacted in 2015 under President Barack Obama, and are designed to prevent internet monopolies from slowing down or blocking access to certain content. In 2017, President Donald Trump’s FCC repealed net neutrality. Now, it’s up to the Biden administration to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21557495/biden-fcc-digital-divide-net-neutrality-section-230">fix the internet</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>CORPORATE EVICTORS WIN BIG? </strong>A federal judge has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/us/politics/eviction-moratorium-biden.html">struck down</a> the national pandemic-related eviction moratorium, creating confusion about the enforcement of the rule, since it had been upheld by two other federal judges. The Department of Justice is appealing the decision. Just before the new ruling was issued, the Biden administration announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/us/biden-evictions.html">cracking down</a> on corporate landlords that were evicting tenants in violation of the moratorium.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>KOCH-BACKED GROUP GEARS UP TO FIGHT FILIBUSTER REFORM: </strong></strong>Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers’ political advocacy group, is targeting conservative Democratic senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to ensure that they don’t back filibuster reform, <a href="https://substack.documented.net/p/the-koch-backed-americans-for-prosperity?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5MjI1MjM5LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozNjA3NDc0NywiXyI6IlFlTy90IiwiaWF0IjoxNjIwMzIzMjQ3LCJleHAiOjE2MjAzMjY4NDcsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yMDExMzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.Tq0jAtO_M7hMQM4GATrLJOgbxphyneN9X8uS5VdwS-U"><em>Documented</em> reports</a>.</li>
