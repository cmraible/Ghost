<p>As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/coronavirus-health-insurance-trump.html">health care crisis worsens</a>, it is worth looking back on the long struggle to get America to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care for all.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/obama-for-single-payer-before-he-was-against-it/">lead up to his U.S. Senate run</a>, Barack Obama cast himself as a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpAyan1fXCE"> proponent of single-payer health care</a>, saying Democrats just had to first win the presidency, the House and the Senate and then it would be possible.</p>
<p>Within two years of being elected to the Senate, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/mr-obama-goes-washington/">he told me in an interview</a> that he was more skeptical of single-payer. Then, when Democrats actually did win the presidency, the House and the Senate, Obama’s new presidential administration <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105442888">bragged</a> about going out of its way to make sure the Affordable Care Act would prevent the creation of a single-payer health care system. Obama’s <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/rahm-to-reid-give-lieberman-what-he-wants">top aides</a> also pressed Senate Democrats to accede to Joe Lieberman’s efforts to kill a public option.</p>
<p>But that didn’t stop at least a few Democrats from mustering the courage to keep pushing.</p>
<p>Rewind 11 years and <a href="https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/at-obama-event-schweitzer-lauds-canadian-health-care-system/article_42fe639a-892f-11de-8992-001cc4c03286.html">read this summer 2009 story from the Missoulian</a>, in which a Democratic governor from a deep red state used his introductory speech of Obama to publicly pressure the new president, the Democratic Party and its corporate-friendly establishment to support a Medicare for All-style health care program:</p>
<blockquote><strong>As Gov. Brian Schweitzer warmed up the crowd Friday for President Barack Obama, he paid a lengthy compliment to a health-care system that leading Democrats, including the president, have declared "off the table" as a reform here: the Canadian single-payer system.</strong><br><br><strong>"Did you know that, just 300 miles north of here, did you know they offered universal health care 62 years ago?" he said, referring to Canada's system of providing government-funded health insurance for all citizens…</strong><br><br><strong>Most of the crowd of 1,300 in the Gallatin Field Airport hangar roared in approval.</strong><br><br><strong>Schweitzer also noted how former Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas, considered the father of the Canadian health system, was recently voted in a nationwide poll as Canada’s most popular person in history…</strong><br><br><strong>Minutes later, Obama made it clear that he does not favor adopting such a system in the United States.</strong></blockquote>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090820142712/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-in-town-hall-on-health-care-Belgrade-Montana/">said</a>: “The majority of people get their health insurance on the job, so let's build on that system that already exists — because for us to completely change that, it would be too disruptive.”</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/public/images/1987ff6e-0f34-41c2-8298-18142381d0f7_500x355.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Since Obama left office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/coronavirus-health-insurance-trump.html">millions</a> of Americans have lost their health care coverage during a historic pandemic, as health care industry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html">profits have skyrocketed</a>. For his part, Obama has come back around, calling Medicare For All a <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/405597-obama-calls-medicare-for-all-a-good-idea">“good, new idea.”</a> It’s too bad he didn’t have that revelation when he was actually in office.</p>
<p>The effort by Schweitzer (whose campaigns I worked on) offer two important lessons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, economic populism and electability are not at odds in the way Democratic consultants often suggest they are. Schweitzer pushed Canadian-style single-payer health care and also won statewide elections in Montana. Arguably, he won those elections during the Bush years precisely <em>because</em> he didn’t sound like a standard corporate-appeasing Democrat.</p>
<p>Second, Democrats do not just have to fall in line behind a president focused on defending health insurance and pharmaceutical companies. There are ways for elected officials to push their party’s president, if they so choose.</p>
<p>For most of the last 40 years, they’ve chosen to do the opposite — Democrats have loyally fallen in line behind their party’s presidents on everything from <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/106-1999/h570">financial deregulation</a> to <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00005">bank bailouts</a>. But it doesn’t have to be that way — and if there is any hope for real progress on health care, it can’t be that way.</p>
<p>Considering the political power of the health care industry, securing even a modest public option — much less Medicare for All — is going to require local, state and national Democratic elected officials to find the courage to pressure their own party’s president, whether that president likes it or not.</p>
