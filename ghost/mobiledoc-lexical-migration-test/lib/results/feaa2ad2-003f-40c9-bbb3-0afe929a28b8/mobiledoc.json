          "In honor of Fourth of July, in this week’s Weekend Reader we explore the increasingly fraught concept of patriotism. What does it mean to be a patriot? Does it mean you get to be as obnoxious and greedy and xenophobic as you want, like the far-right power brokers and pandemic profiteers detailed in some of the articles we include? Or does patriotism mean something more complicated and demanding? In our view, the term applies to the celebrated actor who published an essay this week calling on his fellow elite to confront the reality of our current political moment. And it applies to the people chronicled in a feature on the strange world of sweepers, a subculture so obsessed with corporate sweepstakes they’ve turned gaming the system into their God-given duty. And it applies to the journalists putting out all of these stories — as well as people like you, who are making this reporting possible."

It’s economic inequality that has split us into the well educated and the not well educated… In response to our fear of the most desperately oppressed members of our society, those who aren’t “white,” we’ve come up with various clever techniques to deal with our terror — laws and prisons — and we’ve sought out individuals inclined to brutality and trained them to be brutal policemen… But in response to the slightly less desperate tens of millions of white people who followed and loved Donald Trump, we’re entirely at a loss. And yet the unfortunate truth is that this is what we’re up against: Our common future, the future of everyone in the society, depends on which way these particular tens of millions of people will turn, what they become, what will happen with them.”"

The prospect of investing in massive U.S. government projects — say, by leasing an airport and reaping revenue for decades — has tantalized Wall Street ever since talk about a big infrastructure push broke out in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis… Now — though the details posted Thursday were very scant — it seems a compromise might be at hand.”"

Each day, he enters about 60 sweepstakes — which are random draws — and contests — which are judged. Sponsors range from his local pizza place to national corporations like Nordstrom. Taube dials radio stations to be the 102nd caller, and texts daily keywords like football and BBQ. He enters his contact information into online forms. He posts entries on Facebook and Instagram, then solicits the votes necessary to win by direct messaging allies — a collection of other sweepers who trade favors.”"

And after Donald Trump became president, I watched the concept of patriotism curdle into something far more cruel and violent than it had ever seemed before, a weapon used to shatter families, bar refugees, validate white supremacy, and fuel a violent storming of the Capitol."
