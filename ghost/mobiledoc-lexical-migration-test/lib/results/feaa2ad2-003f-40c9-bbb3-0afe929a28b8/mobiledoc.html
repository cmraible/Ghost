<p>In honor of Fourth of July, in this week’s Weekend Reader we explore the increasingly fraught concept of patriotism. What does it mean to be a patriot? Does it mean you get to be as obnoxious and greedy and xenophobic as you want, like the far-right power brokers and pandemic profiteers detailed in some of the articles we include? Or does patriotism mean something more complicated and demanding? In our view, the term applies to the celebrated actor who published an essay this week calling on his fellow elite to confront the reality of our current political moment. And it applies to the people chronicled in a feature on the strange world of sweepers, a subculture so obsessed with corporate sweepstakes they’ve turned gaming the system into their God-given duty. And it applies to the journalists putting out all of these stories — as well as people like you, who are making this reporting possible.</p>

<h3 id="stuff-we%E2%80%99re-reading">Stuff We’re Reading:</h3>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162742/elite-vs-trump-supporters"><strong>We’re Already Forgetting the Trump Era. His Supporters Won’t Forget Us</strong>.</a> (The New Republic) — <em>The great Wallace Shawn calls on the country’s elite to confront the current political moment: “It’s economic inequality that has split us into groups that confront each other just short of war. It’s economic inequality that has split us into the well educated and the not well educated… In response to our fear of the most desperately oppressed members of our society, those who aren’t “white,” we’ve come up with various clever techniques to deal with our terror — laws and prisons — and we’ve sought out individuals inclined to brutality and trained them to be brutal policemen… But in response to the slightly less desperate tens of millions of white people who followed and loved Donald Trump, we’re entirely at a loss. And yet the unfortunate truth is that this is what we’re up against: Our common future, the future of everyone in the society, depends on which way these particular tens of millions of people will turn, what they become, what will happen with them.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/wall-street-sees-big-wish-granted-in-biden-s-infrastructure-deal"><strong>Wall Street Sees Big Wish Granted in Biden’s Infrastructure Deal</strong></a> (Bloomberg) — <em>“It’s just two words of jargon near the bottom of the infrastructure plan the White House posted Thursday — ‘asset recycling’ — but for a slew of investing titans that longed to see that phrase, it’s reason to rejoice. The prospect of investing in massive U.S. government projects — say, by leasing an airport and reaping revenue for decades — has tantalized Wall Street ever since talk about a big infrastructure push broke out in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis… Now — though the details posted Thursday were very scant — it seems a compromise might be at hand.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162328/endless-work-trying-win-new-life"><strong>The Endless Work of Trying to Win Yourself a New Life</strong></a> (The New Republic)  <em>—</em><em>“Taube, who is 65 and a decades-long resident of the Pacific Northwest, is a sweeper, a term that distinguishes the committed competitor from the casual, one-time entrant. Each day, he enters about 60 sweepstakes — which are random draws — and contests — which are judged. Sponsors range from his local pizza place to national corporations like Nordstrom. Taube dials radio stations to be the 102nd caller, and texts daily keywords like football and BBQ. He enters his contact information into online forms. He posts entries on Facebook and Instagram, then solicits the votes necessary to win by direct messaging allies — a collection of other sweepers who trade favors.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/how-to-make-money-off-a-pandemic/"><strong>How to Make Money Off a Pandemic</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Nation)  <em>— “What looked like chaos or ad hoc decision-making by an improbably elected fraudster president was, in fact, deeply rooted in ideology; specifically, in the belief that the job of the government was neither to exercise leadership, nor activate government agencies to assist the American people. It was to promote private industry and its profits as </em>the <em>solution to anything and everything pandemic.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/climate-crisis-goodell-survive-extreme-heat-875198/"><strong>Can We Survive Extreme Heat?</strong></a><strong></strong>(Rolling Stone) <em>— “Heat is not an equal-opportunity killer. If you’re poor, sick, old, or homeless, you’re more likely to die during a heat wave. Recent immigrants, both legal and undocumented, are particularly at risk. A 2017 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that immigrants are three times more likely than citizens to die from heat-related illnesses. More than 85 percent of non-U.S. citizens who died from heat-related causes were Hispanic.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-secret-history-of-gavin-mcinnes"><strong>The Secret History Of Gavin McInnes</strong></a> (Vanity Fair) <em>— “In the ’90s, he played punk rock and helped create Vice magazine. Five years ago, he founded a very different organization: the Proud Boys, the far-right group that came to personify the vilest tendencies of Trump’s America. A former Vice editor interviews one of our era’s most troubling extremists.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://prospect.org/politics/senates-quiet-opposers-manchin-democrats/"><strong>The Senate’s Quiet Opposers</strong></a><strong></strong>(The American Prospect) <em>— “Unlike other moderate Democrats, Manchin is exceptionally vocal on his stances. As a result, his boisterousness casts a large shadow for the handful of moderate Senate Democrats to hide behind. Instead of an equal distribution of press and criticism on moderate Democrats from the left, there’s been a hyper-concentration on just one man. Instead of a rotating villain, Manchin is a scapegoat, with a small and mighty group quietly backing him.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/05/where-did-that-cockatoo-come-from"><strong>Where Did That Cockatoo Come From?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker)  <em>— This one is just for fun! A rollicking yarn involving ancient paintings, ornithology, cross-cultural exchanges, and modern-day sleuths. A perfect beach read.</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster">A Message From The Daily Poster:</h3>
<p>On July 4, 1995, when I was 16 and a counselor-in-training at a New England summer camp, my friends and I painted our faces red, white, and blue and stormed the dining hall, waving American flags and belting out “Born in the U.S.A.” We did so not out of unbridled patriotism, which really wasn’t something relatively well-off teenagers like us thought much about at the time, but because it seemed like fun and we were young and lively and didn’t know any better.</p>
<p>As I got older, I became less comfortable with patriotic spectacle. In the strange time following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the American flags that appeared in window after window felt to me less like a gesture of healing and camaraderie and more a bellicose statement of “us” versus “them.” As a working journalist, I learned firsthand how politicians and businesses employed facile gestures of nationalistic pride to get away with all sorts of bad behavior. And after Donald Trump became president, I watched the concept of patriotism curdle into something far more cruel and violent than it had ever seemed before, a weapon used to shatter families, bar refugees, validate white supremacy, and fuel a violent storming of the Capitol.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Lately, however, I have felt slightly better about the state of our nation. Don’t get me wrong; we put out enough stories at <em>The Daily Poster</em> detailing the ongoing failures and betrayals of those in power for me to think everything is going great. But the very fact that people like you are supporting us in this work, <a href="http://dailyposter.com/otherposts/please-support-our-new-investigative-fund/">funding our investigations</a> and cheering on our scrappy little newsroom, gives me reason to hope that maybe we still in a place where we can still fight to make things better <em>—</em> and, little by little, actually succeed.</p>
<p>So today, on our Independence Day, I want to recognize you, our subscribers, for understanding that patriotism isn’t a gimmick or a bludgeon, but a responsibility. For realizing that if we think this country still has potential for good, we ourselves have to work for it. Thank you for believing that, and thank you for joining our battle.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
