None of this excuses the attacks by Hamas, which were an attempt to exploit the unrest in Jerusalem, or the failures of the corrupt and ineffective Palestinian Authority, which recently postponed long-overdue elections. But the fact of the matter is that Israel remains the one sovereign authority in the land of Israel and Palestine, and rather than preparing for peace and justice, it has been entrenching its unequal and undemocratic control.”"

And in the late 19th century, Zionists harnessed this long collective memory to create a movement for return to a territory most Jews had never seen. ‘After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion,’ proclaims Israel’s Declaration of Independence. The State of Israel constitutes ‘the realization’ of this ‘age-old dream.’ Why is dreaming of return laudable for Jews but pathological for Palestinians?”"
