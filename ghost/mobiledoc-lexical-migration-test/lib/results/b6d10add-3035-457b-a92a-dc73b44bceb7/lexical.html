<p>Good things are happening! In California, industrial spaces are being turned into parks and gardens, while natural-gas plants are being replaced by a massive build-out of zero-emission power projects. Oregon, meanwhile, just set some of the most ambitious carbon-reduction goals in the country. If that’s not enough, businesses spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere could soon be facing far more serious legal actions, courtesy of powerful new studies on climate change. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRL4uIVzVWI">Yeah science!</a></p>

More than 1,500 legal actions have already been brought against fossil fuel companies whose emissions over decades have played a major role in building up carbon in the atmosphere.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://finesandfeesjusticecenter.org/2021/06/28/new-ny-drivers-license-reform-takes-effect-tuesday/"><strong>New York Ends Policy Of Suspending Driver's Licenses For Ticket Debt</strong></a></strong>(Fines and Fees Justice Center) — <em>“[On] Tuesday June 29, New York’s Driver’s License Suspension Reform Act takes full effect, ending the state’s widespread practice of suspending an individual’s driver’s license when they cannot afford to pay a traffic fine. This legislation will allow hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers to regain their driver’s licenses — and with it their access to work and other necessities.”</em></p>

The new capacity will replace natural-gas power plants and the state’s last nuclear power plant that are set to shut down over the next five years. And unlike previous proposals, Thursday’s order from the California Public Utilities Commission won’t require any natural-gas power plants in that mix.”</em></p>
