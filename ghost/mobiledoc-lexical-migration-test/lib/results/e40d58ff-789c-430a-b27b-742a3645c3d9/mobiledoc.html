<p>A major <em>ProPublica </em>scoop reveals how the nation’s wealthiest often pay nothing at all in federal income taxes. Meanwhile, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., is holding a hearing today to examine the role the Sackler family played in fomenting the opioid crisis as the owners of Purdue Pharma. Also, Biden’s plans for bipartisanship in Washington proved to be magical thinking that has allowed Sen. Joe Manchin and other conservative Democrats to run wild while the party scrambles to deliver on necessary reforms. Furthermore, student loan repayments are set to begin again in a few months and the White House has taken no action.</p>

<p>“The boutique economy has no need of the masses, so let's get rid of them. But how, you ask? Not with wars, surely, or disease, famine, or mass murder. Despots have tried all these methods through the millennia, and they're never a permanent solution. No, all we need to do is buy up the ground from under their feet — and evict them. We're buying up the planet, Bishop, fair and square. We're turning it into the most exclusive gated community in history. Now, the question is, in two hundred years, will you be a member of the landowners club, or will you be living in some tin can in outer space drinking recycled piss?” — <strong>David Marusek, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4542149-mind-over-ship">Mind Over Ship</a></strong></p>

<p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, is holding a hearing Tuesday “To examine the Sackler family’s role in fueling America’s opioid epidemic and policies to promote accountability, like the SACKLER Act.”</p>
<p>The Sacklers own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, which is currently in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings. The Sacklers have used those proceedings to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/opioid-billionaire-demand-sweeping-immunity/">request immunity</a> for themselves and hundreds of other entities including other pharmaceutical companies they are linked to. It looks like the federal judge may grant the request.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/the-sackler-act-and-other-policies-to-promote-accountability-for-the-sackler">watch the hearing here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/less-25-percent-black-americans-212844096.html">Less than 25 percent</a> of Black Americans have received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Experts blame medical skepticism, lack of transportation, insufficient government outreach, and the inability to take time off of work.</p>
<p>In April, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-call-on-all-employers-to-provide-paid-time-off-for-employees-to-get-vaccinated-after-meeting-goal-of-200-million-shots-in-the-first-100-days/">announced</a> a tax credit to employers who offer paid leave to their employees to get the shot. The announcement was meant to incentivize employers.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>On the campaign trail in May 2019, candidate Joe Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/joe-biden-republicans-trump-epiphany/index.html">predicted</a> that Republicans would “have an epiphany” once Donald Trump left office.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at a New Hampshire diner, Biden said, “The thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke. You will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.”</p>
<p>So far, that epiphany hasn’t occurred.</p>
<p>In March, Democrats passed necessary COVID stimulus legislation with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-including-1-n1259795">zero Republicans signing on</a>. That fact hasn’t stopped Biden from making overtures to the GOP. Last week, the president signaled willingness to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-latest-infrastructure-offer-1-trillion-11622725783">reduce his infrastructure proposal</a> from a $1.7 trillion package that included hiking the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent to a $1 trillion package without the tax increase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the president’s party controlling the White House and both houses of Congress, the For The People Act, the Democrats’ voting rights bill, appears to be dead as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/manchin-says-hell-oppose-for-the-people-act.html">announced</a> his opposition to the legislation.</p>
<p>The ambitious legislation was meant to be the Democratic Party’s answer to Republican efforts to suppress voting rights across the country and would have helped save the party’s electoral prospects. The bill contains a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/why-people-act-critical-fair-voting-maps">nonpartisan redistricting provision</a> — not a moment too soon as the GOP won <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/04/redistricting-might-gain-republicans-few-seats-congress-their-real-gains-will-be-state-legislatures/">decisive state legislative victories</a> in the 2020 census-year election.</p>
<p>Republicans remain unified against Biden’s agenda and the president does not seem to have an answer for how to govern in the face of the opposition.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>• THE WEALTHIEST DON’T ALWAYS PAY INCOME TAXES: </strong>Nearly a decade ago, now-Sen. Mitt Romney was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser/">caught complaining</a> that poorer households pay no federal income taxes. It turns out some of the wealthiest Americans don’t either. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos paid no federal income taxes in 2007 or 2011, while Tesla founder Elon Musk paid none in 2018, according to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">a <em>ProPublica</em> review</a> of Internal Revenue Service tax returns. “The IRS records show that the wealthiest can — perfectly legally — pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, their fortunes grow each year,” <em>ProPublica </em>reported.</p>
<p><strong>• INDIGENOUS ORGANIZERS DEMAND WHITE HOUSE ACTION:</strong> It is the <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/06/07/which-side-are-you-stopline3-protesters-appeal-biden-historic-day-action">largest ever protest of its kind in Minnesota</a>: More than 2,000 Indigenous-led water protectors are demonstrating to stop the replacement and expansion of Enbridge’s Line 3 tar sands pipeline. The group has been blockading the construction at key sites. Protesters are calling on President Biden to shut down the project. Biden rescinded the federal permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day as president, but he has allowed the Dakota Access Pipeline to continue.</p>
<p><strong>• BIG LAW FIRMS ARE HELPING TO KILL UNION EFFORTS… FOR FREE: </strong>Amid unionization pushes among public defenders, three public defense organizations are turning to big law firms with members on their boards. The firms are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-nonprofits-hiring-big-law-firms-to-block-union-organizing-2021-5">advising the organizations pro bono</a> against their own staff.</p>
<p><strong>• STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS LOOM; WHITE HOUSE M.I.A.: </strong>President Joe Biden has declined to cancel student loan debt, <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loan-debt#:~:text=loan%20borrowers%20here.-,Total%20federal%20student%20loan%20debt,student%20loan%20borrowers%3A%2042.9%20million.">92 percent</a> of which is held by the federal government. “The idea that you go to Penn and you’re paying a total of 70,000 bucks a year and the public should pay for that? I don’t agree,” the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/opinion/joe-biden-david-brooks-interview.html">told</a><em>New York Times</em> columnist David Brooks last month. So far, the administration has taken no meaningful steps to tackle the <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/#:~:text=The%20most%20recent%20data%20indicate,Americans%20with%20student%20loan%20debt">$1.7 trillion</a> crisis that affects 44.7 million Americans. Meanwhile, student loan repayments are set to <a href="https://twitter.com/Quicktake/status/1401921491923525640?s=20">resume in October</a>, leaving many without relief.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TAX LOOPHOLE: </strong>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cabinet-certificates-of-divestiture">Fox News analysis</a> found that a number of Biden administration officials <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/news/new-raimondo-reportedly-took-advantage-of-little-known-federal-law-to-avoid">took advantage</a> of a tax loophole enabling them to avoid taxes on assets they sell off, if the sales are done in order to avoid conflicts of interest. The officials cited in the report included Attorney General Merrick Garland, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. In December 2016, The <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-cabinet-could-avoid-millions-in-taxes-thanks-to-this-little-known-law/2016/12/02/509d009a-b7f5-11e6-959c-172c82123976_story.html">reported</a> that the loophole could provide a windfall to members of the Trump administration.</p>
