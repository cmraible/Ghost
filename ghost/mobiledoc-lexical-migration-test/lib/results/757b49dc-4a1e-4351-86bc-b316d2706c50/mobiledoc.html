<p>The Biden administration’s decision to purposely avoid a big fight over health care may pay short-term political dividends for the White House, but it will end up strengthening the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, according to the <em>American Prospect</em>. Biden’s move is bad for millions of Americans today, and could make it even more difficult to fix the broken health care system in the future.</p>
<p>Also, a look at how opinion on Israel is changing in the United States, and among Jewish Americans in particular. And a review of some disturbing news in the world of journalism, plus reasons to be cautiously optimistic that independent media can start filling the void.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>• <a href="https://prospect.org/health/dangers-of-ducking-the-health-care-fight/"><strong>The Dangers of Ducking the Health Care Fight</strong></a> (American Prospect) — <em>“Shying away from a fight with the health industry today will just lead to a more impossible fight tomorrow. And yet, that pretty well articulates what the Biden administration’s political theory is right now. For the past 50 years, incoming Democratic administrations and the party base have made health care a top policy priority; the Biden administration has not. The American Rescue Plan did nothing on health care other than increasing federal subsidies for the purchase of health insurance, and only for a limited time period tied to the pandemic. The White House had to be dragged kicking and screaming just to extend those subsidies in its current American Families Plan proposal. Other Biden campaign promises, like a public option or a plan to deal with prescription drug costs, have thus far been left on the cutting-room floor.”</em></p>

I offer one possible solution: The federal government could make climate labelling mandatory for food, not unlike what it did with nutritional content in the early 1990s. An industry-wide system would be ideal, but to speed implementation while maintaining impact, the Biden administration should first target those foods most responsible for heating our planet: meat and dairy.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A Message From Sirota:</strong></h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week brought more bad news for journalism: A vulture hedge fund is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/21/998730863/vulture-fund-alden-global-known-for-slashing-newsrooms-buys-tribune-papers">taking control</a> of the Tribune Company, and if past actions are any indication, that could mean more mass layoffs of rank-and-file reporters, on top of the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/2020-newsroom-layoffs-data/">16,000+ journalism jobs that were lost in 2020</a>. That’s bad news for democracy.</p>
<p>Of late, there has been a lot of hype about the possibilities of new independent platforms to liberate writers and rescue journalism from this downward spiral. I’m cautiously optimistic about that prospect — but with some reservations.</p>
<p>The rise of new platforms can be a significant game-changing development in the effort to fix media — but only if the new platforms are used to support journalism rather than just hot takes, and only if readers are willing to support teams of journalists rather than just individual opinionists.</p>
<p>Put another way: We have to do the hard work of building new journalism institutions, and resist the easy path of just trying to create new pundit celebrities.</p>
<p>This is what we’re trying to do at <em>The Daily Poster</em>, and this past week illustrated the potential. From our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/koch-funded-eviction-push-while-buying-real-estate-stakes/">Koch investigation</a>, to our reporting on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-weak-pause-on-drilling-permits/">climate policy</a>, to our scrutiny of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-money-v-the-public-option/">health care politics</a>, our small team of reporters broke big stories, which were then amplified by other media outlets and political leaders, <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1396241750101004289">including Sen. Bernie Sanders</a>.</p>
<p>None of this would be possible without you — our supporting subscribers. You are why I am increasingly optimistic that we can continue growing our support, building our newsroom, and contributing to a larger movement for a better media.</p>
<p>There are no shortcuts here. Building an engaged readership that supports real journalism that challenges power is a long, slow process. And the “engaged” part is critical — we want and need your input, feedback and tips. You should always use the comments at the bottom of articles to provide us feedback — we read every single one. And you should always feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> — we take every email to heart.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of this movement for a better media, which is part of the larger movement for a better world. This is not a short sprint, it is a marathon — but it is worth the effort. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
