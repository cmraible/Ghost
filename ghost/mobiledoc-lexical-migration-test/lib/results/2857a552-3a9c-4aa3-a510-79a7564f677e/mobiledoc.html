He has written a powerful essay about why he is joining other progressives in voting against the Democratic Party platform.</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://www.cjr.org/public_editor/msnbc-public-editor-a-strained-symbiosis-with-obama.php">A Strained Symbiosis With Obama</a></strong> (Columbia Journalism Review) — <em>“MSNBC was not and is not about to call Obama out for having broken his campaign promises of transparency, for permitting nine million people to lose their homes in the mortgage crisis, for failing to jail even a single banker, or for having failed to call the butchers of Iraq to account. There is no cable news station broadcasting today that is willing to state the blindingly obvious, to wit, that a less corrupt, less wealth-enslaved, less warmongering Democratic Party—a party that had paid more than lip service to the needs of working people over the previous eight years—would have walked away with the 2016 election.”</em></p>

They can already legally terminate people for almost any reason, including what they say at work. One of the few exceptions to that rule has been U.S. labor law protections for people protesting unfair workplace conditions. Now, companies have wider legal authority to axe those employees, too. New rules for employers come from a sweeping National Labor Relations Board ruling last week.”</em></p>

Billionaires understand this — and so they are making college campuses a target.</em></p>
