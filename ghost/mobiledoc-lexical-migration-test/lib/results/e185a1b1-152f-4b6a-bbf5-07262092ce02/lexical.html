<p>Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/trump-demands-congress-raise-second-stimulus-check-from-600-to-2000-under-new-covid-relief-bill.html">veto</a> emergency stimulus legislation unless lawmakers increased direct payments to millions of families facing the prospect of <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2020/12/21/ny-renters-face-pandemic-eviction/3945132001/">eviction</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/millions-of-americans-lost-health-insurance-amid-pandemic-here-are-options.html">loss of health insurance</a>, unemployment and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/hunger-coronavirus-economy/">starvation</a>. Lawmakers had settled on meager one-time $600 checks but the president demanded $2,000 payments — a proposal that was championed months ago by congressional progressives but that was ignored by both parties’ legislative leaders.</p>
<p>The declaration from the GOP president follows his other recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/600-is-not-enough-and-it-wont-get/">statements</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1340527057151930369?s=21">support</a> of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-wants-congress-to-approve-stimulus-checks-2020-12">bigger checks</a>. The entire situation shows that Joe Biden and Democratic congressional leaders either could have driven a much tougher bargain in their negotiations over new COVID-19 relief legislation with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — or they actually <a href="__GHOST_URL__/end-the-austerity-loop/">deliberately prioritized austerity</a> and didn’t want a bigger spending package in the first place.</p>
<p>Luckily for Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer — and for millions of people who need help — Trump is giving them one last chance to do the right thing and back a bolder version of the $1,200 direct payment proposal that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., have been pushing from the beginning of this most recent round of negotiations.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1341571523770019840?s=20">seven months ago</a> Sanders joined Sens. Kamala Harris, Ed Markey and Kirsten Gillibrand in introducing a bill to provide monthly $2,000 checks to individuals until the pandemic is over. (That’s not surprising, given that Sanders and the Congressional Progressive Caucus he led were the <a href="https://lee.house.gov/news/press-releases/congresswoman-barbara-lee-promotes-progressive-caucus-tax-plan">original authors</a> of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2001/US/07/20/tax.rebate/">first stimulus check of the modern era</a>, way back in 2001.)</p>
<p>The question now: Will Pelosi, Schumer and Biden do everything in their power to call Trump’s bluff and force a vote to increase the $600 checks to $2,000?</p>
<h4 id="pelosi-feels-the-heat-but-may-be-trying-to-hedge"><strong>Pelosi Feels The Heat, But May Be Trying To Hedge</strong></h4>
<p>Pelosi clearly feels the heat — she is suddenly <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1341557535732604935">pretending</a> she’s always been ready to take Trump up on his offer to support $2,000 survival checks, even though prior to about an hour ago, she had never tried to triangulate Trump against McConnell on the issue. Earlier this month, she supported a deal that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pelosi-now-backs-stimulus-deal-half-size-what-white-house-offered-before-election-1551890">did not include checks</a> at all, and just yesterday she <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/nancy-pelosi-wanted-more-600-225424935.html">insisted</a> that $600 checks were “significant.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the $2,000 is a new ask for Democratic leaders — progressive lawmakers had been pushing it for months, but Pelosi’s much-touted HEROES Act only asked for $1,200 one-time, means-tested checks.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Democratic House Speaker is now finally saying she wants a vote to amend the stimulus bill to increase the small $600 checks to $2,000 — and such an <a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1341568309955874818">amendment has already been written</a> by Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, Pelosi’s statement of support includes a bit of a hedge. She says she wants to bring it up by unanimous consent — a process that gives any single member of the House the ability to raise an objection and block it. That could let her pretend she tried to force a vote, but was thwarted by a Republican dissenter. But she is House Speaker — there are ways for her to <em>truly </em>force a vote.</p>
<p>As the American Prospect’s David Dayen <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1341561428071776256?s=20">notes</a>, Pelosi could, for instance, do it under a separate process of suspending the rules which would mean that to stop it, “140 Republicans have to buck Trump and deny a cash lump-sum payout to the American people.”</p>
<p>In the Senate, Schumer can start <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1341568477157445634">demanding</a> unanimous consent to pass the $2,000 check legislation every day the body is in session — a process that would have the <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1341563531775406083?s=20">added benefit</a> of putting the heat on Georgia incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue to pick which side they are on.</p>
<p>As for Biden, he was embarrassingly muted when a proposal for $1,200 checks was a live option — his transition team seemed <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-goes-to-bat-for-blackrock-stays/">far more enthusiastic</a> about protecting a program that helped BlackRock than it did about immediately securing direct aid for families. In fact, Biden also <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-speech-on-2020-job-numbers-economy-transcript-december-4">signaled</a> his support for the original checkless deal earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, Biden has a rare chance to show some leadership, put the heat on McConnell, and actually extract more money from him to help the public. People need help now, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/600-is-not-enough-and-it-wont-get/">it won’t be any easier</a> to get big spending bills through a McConnell-led Senate if Democrats don’t win the two Georgia senate races next month.</p>
<p>Either way, the country’s <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2020/12/22/pandemic-payments-total-to-2263-per-person/">experience with the first round of support</a> shows that increasing direct payments now could immediately reduce poverty. It could also help build the case for new rounds of bigger checks down the line.</p>
<h4 id="democrats-have-the-chance-to-actually-make-the-bill-better"><strong>Democrats Have The Chance To Actually Make The Bill Better</strong></h4>
<p>The whole situation could be a big winner for Democrats and show they actually care about human beings. It gives them a high-profile moment to appear as if they care about improving the grotesque spending package that’s currently on the table.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-hunger-coronavirus-pandemic-4c7f1705c6d8ef5bac241e6cc8e331bb">Americans are in bread lines</a>, and yet the current omnibus legislation skimps on direct aid to millions of people — while offering billions of dollars worth of tax breaks for <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-stimulus-deal-tax-breaks-business-201042359.html">race horse owners</a>, landlords, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-21/beer-restaurants-and-nascar-win-tax-breaks-in-virus-relief-bill">NASCAR</a> and corporate executives’ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/20/meal-tax-deduction/">three-martini lunches</a>.</p>
<p>The current bill spends only $166 billion on survival checks, while devoting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/us/politics/coronavirus-relief-bill.html?smid=tw-share">$200 billion</a> to new tax breaks for the rich. It <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2020/12/21/expenses-with-ppp-money-are-tax-deductible-congress-reverses-irs/?sh=11b6f5d71e1f">exempts</a> business expenses under the paycheck protection program from taxes, while <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-tax-time-bomb-unemployment-benefits-taxed/">taxing workers’ jobless benefits</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/paid-sick-leave-ends-coronavirus-mcconnell">ending</a> a paid coronavirus sick leave mandate.</p>
<p>It offers just $25 billion in rental assistance, at a moment when an estimated <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/16/million-could-face-eviction-after-holidays-heres-how-help/3821743001/">14 million</a> American households are in danger of eviction and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/">will owe roughly $70 billion</a> in unpaid rental and utility debt by January, according to Moody's Analytics Mark Zandi. The bill includes a separate retroactive tax break for landlords projected to cost <a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2020/jcx-24-20/">$3 billion</a> — which probably doesn’t help people pay their rent.</p>
<p>And as the legislation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/business/stimulus-state-local-aid.html">excludes</a> direct aid to states and cities, it is wrapped in an omnibus package that spends roughly $700 billion on security spending that includes funding for new weapons systems; Trump’s Space Force; <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/spending-deal-includes-border-wall-funds-not-police-provisions/">border wall construction</a>; and military aid to countries such as Egypt, Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>Trump has stumbled and blustered his way into giving Democrats a chance to make this legislation significantly better — and to also go on offense against McConnell and against the Georgia Republican incumbents they need to defeat in order to win the Senate.</p>
<p>The opportunity is right there for them. Now they need to do what’s right.</p>
