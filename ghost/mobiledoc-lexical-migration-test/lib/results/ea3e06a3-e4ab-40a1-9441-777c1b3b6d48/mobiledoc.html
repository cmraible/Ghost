<p>In 2019, conservative West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin co-sponsored the “For the People Act,” his party’s landmark voting rights and democracy reform legislation. But sticking with his current plan to be the ultimate political wet blanket, earlier this week he announced he’ll oppose the bill this year because it “has garnered zero Republican support.”</p>
<p>Reform advocates are now working to change Manchin’s mind on the bill — and one of the main people leading the charge happens to have a long history with the West Virginia senator.</p>

But they’ve gotten more vocal this week about their priorities — such as investments aimed at electrifying the nation’s vehicles in order to combat climate change — being left out of any eventual deal,” <em>Huffington Post reports. </em>In the past, this <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1402695302482567171?s=20">has been an empty threat</a>, but maybe this time we will end up pleasantly surprised.</p>

On Friday, the Forest Service said it would “repeal or replace” a Trump-era rollback that allows companies to build roads and other infrastructure in much of America’s largest national forest. It could be [the] biggest victory for public lands the Biden administration has delivered yet — if the details pan out.”</p>

<p>“Obamacare for me means paying a second rent to have a plastic card in my pocket. Disaster insurance. I can't afford the out of pocket, so getting actual healthcare means going into debt. It's better than the nothing I could get before, but not actual healthcare. I can only hope not to be one of the 1 in 6 (!!!) claims that get rejected, leaving one with huge bills. This is not a solution and shame on Democrats who suggest it is. Another global crisis passes, another historic opportunity lost.” — Phil, commenting on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/celebrating-amid-a-worsening-crisis/">Celebrating Amid A Worsening Crisis</a></p>
