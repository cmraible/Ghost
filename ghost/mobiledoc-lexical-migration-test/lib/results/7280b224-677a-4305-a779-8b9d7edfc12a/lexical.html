<p>Friends:</p>

<p>One top journalist said the guide is <a href="https://twitter.com/AASchapiro/status/1381668627338825728?s=20">“a super valuable resource.”</a> Another <a href="https://twitter.com/saminthecan/status/1381706970651111424">said</a> he spent four years in journalism school “and I didn't get a single class on anything in this guide — genuinely can't thank <em>Daily Poster</em> enough for publishing this.” And the <em>Washington Post</em>’s top political reporter has <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1359225670409342982?s=20">said</a> “<em>The Daily Poster</em> became a must-read in a hurry.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a top staffer at Joe Biden’s polling firm <a href="https://twitter.com/LenetBen/status/1381924754702147590">attacked us</a> for publishing the guide — which isn’t surprising, because the guide is all about how regular folks can follow the money and hold politicians of both parties accountable.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is the Citizens’ Guide that the president’s political aides don’t want anyone to read — which, of course, is exactly why you should <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/cc9952b6"><strong>click here and read it</strong></a>.</p>
