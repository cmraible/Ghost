<p>As they blocked $2,000 survival checks, Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn argued that the money would enrich the wealthy — and that assertion has  been echoed by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/millionaire-joe-manchin-threatening/">threatened</a> to hold up the proposal because he says it does not adequately <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/10/manchin-prefers-targeted-stimulus-checks-457065">target</a> benefits to those who need it most.</p>
<p>“I'm all for targeting the money,” Manchin <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2101/10/sotu.01.html">told</a> CNN this weekend. When host Jake Tapper asked if he would support sending checks to anyone who makes under $75,000, Manchin said: “Not carte blanche across the board.” He added that Congress has been “sending checks to people that basically already have a check and aren't going to be able to spend that.”</p>
<p>These talking points have been echoed by some <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1342173060955332609">liberal</a><a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1343901973763022848?s=20">pundits</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-increasing-the-stimulus-checks-from-600-to-2000-is-a-bad-idea/2020/12/29/d012ca70-49f6-11eb-839a-cf4ba7b7c48c_story.html">billionaire-owned</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-30/more-covid-relief-is-needed-but-2-000-checks-aren-t-the-answer">media outlets</a>, which have depicted the checks as mostly going to people who don’t need help.</p>
<p>But new data prove that rhetoric is bullshit: In fact, the survival checks would immediately deliver enormous benefits to the poorest Americans facing eviction, starvation and bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In all, the bottom 60 percent of income earners — who made less than $65,000 in 2020 — “would see an average income increase of 11 percent by a $2,000 payment,” according to the <a href="https://itep.org/how-the-proposed-2000-cash-payments-compare-to-the-600-already-provided-by-congress/">report</a> from the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. That compares with just a 3 percent increase with only the recently passed $600 checks.</p>
<p>Under House Democrats’ <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/9051">CASH Act</a>, the poorest 20 percent of Americans — who make less than $21,300 — would receive the biggest boost of all: $2,000 checks would increase their income by roughly 29 percent.</p>

<p>In December, McConnell — who is <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/net-worth?cid=N00003389&amp;year=2018">worth</a> an estimated $34 million — blocked the checks, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/30/mitch-mcconnell-nixes-standalone-proposal-2-000-stimulus-checks/4092009001/">insisting</a> that "The Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of Democrats' rich friends who don't need the help.”</p>
<p>ITEP data shows that the proposal would deliver more than $4 billion worth of aid to Kentuckians making less than $60,000 a year.</p>
<p>The checks would deliver a 33 percent boost to the income of the poorest 20 percent of households in McConnell’s state.</p>

<p>Similarly, Cornyn <a href="https://twitter.com/mmcauliff/status/1344385859550851074">asserted</a> that the checks are “about helping millionaires and billionaires.”</p>
<p>In Cornyn’s home state of Texas, $2,000 survival checks would deliver roughly $30 billion to 10 million adults who make less than $62,000. The checks would give the average Texan in the bottom 20 percent of income earners a 25 percent boost in their income.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Manchin’s state of West Virginia, 80 percent of the population makes less than $86,600. Those households would receive a combined total of $2.5 billion from the checks — and the bottom 20 percent of West Virginia income earners would see a 33 percent boost in their income.</p>
<p>In all three states — as in the entire country as a whole — the richest 1 percent would receive no benefits from the checks.</p>
