Now a new report suggests the year was even worse for these employees than most people imagined, since many of their employers found ways to bend the rules to cut workers’ pay while giving big raises to their CEOs.</p>

<p>“The problem is we are not making enough money to make it worth it to go back to these jobs that are difficult and dirty and usually thankless. You’re getting yelled at and disrespected all day. It’s hell.” — Sara Wojtala, 31, who worked in retail before the pandemic, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/07/jobs-report-labor-shortage-analysis/">as told to <em>The Washington Post</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>In 2020, as the pandemic raged, over half of the nation’s 100 largest low-wage employers gave their executives massive raises while cutting wages for frontline workers, according to a <a href="https://ips-dc.org/how-corporations-pumped-up-ceo-pay-while-their-low-wage-workers-suffered-in-the-pandemic/">new report</a> from the Institute for Policy Studies.</p>
<p>“Among these 51 rule-rigging companies, average CEO compensation was $15.3 million in 2020, while median worker pay was $28,187 on average. The average CEO- worker pay ratio: 830 to 1,” the report found.</p>
<p>In March, lawmakers in the House and Senate <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-combat-corporate-greed-and-end-outrageous-ceo-pay/">introduced</a> the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, which would increase taxes on companies that pay executives at least 50 times more than the median worker.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>TREASURY GUIDANCE ON STATE AND LOCAL AID: </strong>The Treasury Department has released a long-awaited <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FRF-Interim-Final-Rule.pdf">interim final rule</a> on how states and localities can use the $350 billion they will receive under the American Rescue Plan. In addition to delineating how the funds can be used, the rule further clarifies how a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/this-last-minute-provision-blocks-gop-govs-using-stimulus-money-subsidize-tax-cuts-1576676">provision</a> of the ARP that prevents the funds from being used to subsidize tax cuts will be implemented. The guidance sets a floor for tax revenue at 2019 revenue levels indexed to inflation, so that if states or localities slash any type of tax revenue — <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenLoricchio/status/1391846503539527682?s=20">including</a> corporate tax subsidies — below 2019 levels, they must either cut spending by the same amount or return the ARP aid they received equivalent to that amount. The guidance allows for some wiggle room — one percent of that 2019 amount — so that states can enact some small tax cuts and still be within the rules.</li>
    <li><strong>CONGRESS THREATENS TO DERAIL BIDEN’S TAX PLAN: </strong>Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">has proposed</a> tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations to fund his infrastructure bill, but defectors in Congress from his own party <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/05/11/biden-taxes-democrats/">are threatening</a> to withhold their votes for such tax hikes in response to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1392128733004263428?s=20">donor pressure</a>. Meanwhile, Democratic congressional leadership is pushing for a repeal of the SALT cap, which could cost <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/repealing-salt-cap-would-be-regressive-and-proposed-offset-would-use-up-needed">about $600 billion</a>, the benefits of which would <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly/">largely go</a> to the wealthiest Americans — not to mention <a href="__GHOST_URL__/democrats-gunning-to-end-salt-cap-stand-to-benefit/">many of the lawmakers</a> pushing to repeal the cap.</li>
    <li><strong>SENATORS BEAT THE MARKET: </strong>U.S. Senators are engaged in frequent stock trading and tend to outperform the stock market, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1388963844685324288?s=20">new report</a> by <em>Unusual Whales</em>, which analyzes stock trading. Sen.
