<p>Good things are happening! America’s largest labor union announced an effort this week to organize Amazon warehouses across the country, while the mammoth retailer is also about to face new regulatory scrutiny. Also, the Democratic Socialists of America are suing the private company that profits from Chicago’s parking meters, while the former president of the National Rifle Association is tricked into a stunt that perfectly illustrates the impact of the gun industry’s loathsome lobbying efforts.</p>

<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/in-global-first-connecticut-passes-bill-addressing-insurers-participation-in-risky-fossil-fuel-finance/"><strong>Connecticut Passes Bill Addressing Insurers’ Participation in Risky Fossil Fuel Finance</strong></a><strong></strong>(Public Citizen) — <em>“For the first time anywhere, an insurance regulator will have the mandate to push insurers to bring their investments and underwriting in line with science-based emissions reduction targets. Insurance company investments and underwriting keep allowing the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure that fuels global warming, putting insurance markets and consumers at risk,” said Yevgeny Shrago, Policy Counsel at Public Citizen’s Climate Program, in a statement about new Connecticut legislation to tackle the role of insurers in fossil fuel financing.</em></p>
<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/06/climate-focused-hedge-funds-new-index-fund-engine-no-1/619264/"><strong>A Major New Index Fund Should Unnerve Climate-Skeptical CEOs</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Atlantic) — “<em>Last month, a tiny hedge fund called Engine No. 1 staged a coup of sorts at ExxonMobil — a shareholders’ revolt that unseated three members of the oil company’s board of directors and replaced them with more climate-concerned candidates. The putsch was the first centered on climate change at an American oil company. Now the financial group is ready to recruit ordinary investors — people with 401(k)s, Robinhooders, the macroprudentially curious — into its army. Tomorrow it is launching an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that will track the performance of the 500 largest public companies in America, the firm told The Atlantic.”</em></p>

<p>“Here is a tip: As soon as you get the dreaded call, tell the caller to hold for a second so you can turn on your recorder. The callers attitude will change because they know the law and they know they are not allowed to browbeat the debtor. This was told to me by a friend who worked for a collection agency.” — A good tip from a reader in response to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/nothing-is-more-important-than-you-paying-them/">Walker Bragman’s story this week</a> on the wrath of private debt collectors.</p>
