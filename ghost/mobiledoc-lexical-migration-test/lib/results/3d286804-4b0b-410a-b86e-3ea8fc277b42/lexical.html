<p>For years, scientists have been <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20181019/scientists-warn-flooding-to-be-more-common-in-central-texas">warning</a> that Central Texas — and Austin in particular — is threatened by storms made bigger by climate change. On Sunday, what had once been a typical month’s worth of rain <a href="https://twitter.com/markpenawx/status/1426981395080097793?s=21">poured down</a> on Austin in the span of 30 minutes, <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/08/15/flash-flood-warning-issued-austin-and-travis-county/8144241002/">flooding the Capitol building</a>. </p>
<p>But those warnings, and climate-linked catastrophes throughout the state, have not deterred Texas’s oil-bankrolled officials from doing everything they can to boost the fossil fuel industry that is creating the climate disaster. On the contrary, the flooding occurred less than three months after GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed a pair of laws designed to prevent local communities and corporations from reducing their carbon footprints.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-natural-gas-bans-climate-plans/">new law</a> makes a mockery of politicians’ paeans to “local control,” using state authority to ban communities from using zoning regulations and codes to restrict or ban fossil fuel infrastructure in new construction. The<em><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/18/texas-natural-gas-bans-climate-plans/"><em>Texas Tribune</em></a></em> noted that the bipartisan legislation was a response to a <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2021/07/californias-cities-lead-way-gas-free-future">growing number of cities</a> — <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/a-texas-city-had-a-bold-new-climate-plan-until-a-gas-company-got-involved/">including Austin</a> — considering mandates requiring new developments be built to all-electric standards. The Texas prohibition on such forward-thinking climate policy is being <a href="https://www.supportdemocracy.org/the-latest/state-preemption-bills-passed-and-pending-a-mid-session-snapshot">replicated</a> in other states. </p>
<p>The other <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=SB13">bill</a> signed by Abbott is just as extreme: As more and more institutional investors press the companies they own stakes in to reduce their carbon emissions, Texas will now deny government contracts to companies that stop doing business with the fossil fuel industry. </p>
<p>The law applies not only to procurement, but also to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-15/texas-targets-wall-street-in-fight-over-sustainable-investing">state’s massive market-moving public retirement systems</a>, in an effort to halt the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-new-york-fossil-fuels-pensions/nyc-pension-funds-vote-to-divest-4-billion-from-fossil-fuels-idUSKBN29U23Q">growing success</a> of the divestment movement. Depending on how the Texas law is interpreted, it could mean the state’s pension overseers will be forced to continue investing hundreds of billions of dollars of workers’ retirement savings in corporations that are knowingly exacerbating the same climate crisis now wreaking havoc in Texas.</p>
<p>The Texas laws were produced by a political system that in the last decade alone has been flooded with more than <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;s=TX&amp;y=2021,2020,2019,2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;d-cci=33">$100 million of oil industry campaign cash</a>. That includes a whopping <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;y=2021,2020,2019,2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;law-eid=11281947&amp;d-cci=33">$25 million to Abbott</a>.</p>
<p>The laws are also a product of a national media ecosystem that still often bakes climate denial into its coverage. </p>
<p>In that ecosystem, there is straight-up climate omission — climate-intensified weather disasters are often covered <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/cable-news/cable-news-programs-lag-behind-their-broadcast-news-counterparts-linking-climate-change">without any mention</a> of their link to rising carbon in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>But there is also often a lack of climate policy context that might provide voters with an idea of exactly who to hold accountable.</p>
<p>While there are certainly terrific outlets like the <em>Tribune</em> trying to add context to the stories, most disaster coverage typically omits references to the policies and politicians that have been making the climate crisis worse (side note: you can go <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=HB17">here</a> and <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=SB13">here</a> to see the Texas legislators who voted for the aforementioned fossil fuel bills). </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>In part, this lack of context reflects the fact that specific individual disasters are not a singular result of one or another specific policies (ie. flooding in Austin was not directly caused by legislation passed a few months ago). </p>
<p>Droughts, wildfires and floods are more nebulously worsened by an entire agenda implemented over decades, and so political context often is avoided for fear of it being labeled climate hysteria — even though that context is so critical. Worse, green policies are sometimes even blamed for the disasters. For instance, after <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-texas-blackouts-showed-how-climate-extremes-threaten-energy-systems-across-the-us-155834">extreme weather</a> this past winter shut down Texas’s ill-prepared energy grid, there was a <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/media-reaction-texas-deep-freeze-power-blackouts-and-the-role-of-global-warming">media-amplified effort</a> to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/">pretend</a> clean energy caused the problem (<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-wind-turbines-frozen/">it didn’t</a>). </p>
<p>If history is any guide, it’s a good bet that after the flooding of the Texas Capitol, there will be little reevaluation of the anti-science policies legislated in that same drenched building — even though the situation should be another enduring symbol warning us that we must change.</p>
