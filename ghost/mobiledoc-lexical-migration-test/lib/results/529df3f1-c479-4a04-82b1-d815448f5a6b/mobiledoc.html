<p>“I don't want to go to Washington to say that we cover millions more Americans. I don't want to go there to say that we're covering tens of millions more Americans. I want to go there to say that we are all covered, and everyone can see a doctor when they are sick.” - Wisconsin Senate candidate Tom Nelson in <a href="https://twitter.com/NelsonforWI/status/1354873377798975491">a new video</a> announcing his support for Medicare for All.</p>

<p>Redditors shocked Wall Street (and the stock market) yesterday, successfully driving up GameStop’s stock price so much it nearly bankrupted a short seller hedge fund. Short sellers helped create the conditions for the 2008 stock market crash. Over a decade ago, then-Senator and longtime Biden adviser Ted Kaufman introduced <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1354509070984646658?s=20">a bill to crack down</a> on predatory short-selling, but it didn’t go anywhere.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>LATEST ON SURVIVAL CHECKS: </strong>The White House is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/covid-stimulus-update-white-house-signals-it-could-tweak-check-plan-in-relief.html">considering</a><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/01/28/scoop-inside-the-white-houses-new-thinking-on-covid-relief-491555">pushing</a> more “targeted” survival checks. Some economists and media outlets <a href="__GHOST_URL__/read-my-lips-2000-now/">have started pressing Congress</a> to restrict checks to individuals earning less than $50,000 and households earning less than $75,000 — which would cut out about half of all U.S. households. Meanwhile, progressives in the House are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/28/biden-coronavirus-stimulus-checks-463268">demanding monthly checks</a> instead of one-time payments.</li>
    <li><strong>CORPORATE IMMUNITY KILLS: </strong>A new investigation from New York Attorney General Letitia James found that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration underreported COVID deaths in nursing homes by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/nyregion/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo.html">nearly 50 percent</a>. State assemblyman Ron Kim, who chairs the aging committee, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanClarkReports/status/1354826146165223428?s=20">said</a> that Cuomo’s decision last spring to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">give nursing homes corporate immunity</a> was “a business model soaked in blood.” Read <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s reporting series on Cuomo’s corporate immunity order <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/hospitals-and-nursing-homes-spent/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ny-dems-created-mcconnells-corporate/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/exclusive-states-are-copying-and/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-senate-gop-copied-and-pasted-25d/">here</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-limit-cuomos-corporate-immunity/">here</a><strong>.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>“GREEN NEW DEAL” </strong>Biden’s climate policy is <a href="https://twitter.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1354603913035591681?s=20">drawing heavily</a> from the Green New Deal, but the president is <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRBennett/status/1354444412462526465?s=20">not using</a> that phrase. Whatever he wants to call it, Biden needs to <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/how-joe-biden-wins-the-climate-messaging-war-and-fixes-1846144810">frame climate policy</a><a href="https://twitter.com/jnoisecat/status/1353822069591601152?s=20">in terms of</a> jobs and racial and economic justice, advocates say.</li>
    <li><strong>INSURRECTION CASH: </strong>Corporations need to “carefully examine their millions of dollars in political spending from corporate funds, not just the more limited PAC spending,” according to an <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/26/opinion/companies-need-reevaluate-full-range-their-political-spending/">op-ed</a> written by a Harvard Business School professor and government watchdog group. This is a key point, because the real money bankrolling the GOP goes to super PACs, not just direct campaign donations from corporate PACs that have <a href="https://popular.info/p/where-things-stand">suspended support</a> for GOP politicians. Read <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-slush-fund-bankrolling-the-insurrectionist/">reporting on this here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>STILL COUNTING: </strong>The decennial census, which was supposed to be completed at the end of December 2020, is now expected to wrap up sometime this March due to pandemic-related delays. This has two important implications: First, it means that the <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/politics-of-counting-trump-administration-subverted-census/">Biden administration can take action</a> to correct some of Trump’s most egregious efforts to undermine the census, and second, it means that redistricting has been delayed, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/28/census-redistricting-delays-2022-house-463388">throwing a wrench</a> in campaigns preparing for the 2022 midterm elections.</li>
