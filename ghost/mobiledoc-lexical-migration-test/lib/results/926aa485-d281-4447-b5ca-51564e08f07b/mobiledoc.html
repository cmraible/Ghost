<p>“Capitalism is what is left when beliefs have collapsed at the level of ritual or symbolic elaboration, and all that is left is the consumer-spectator, trudging through the ruins and the relics.” — Mark Fisher, <em>Capitalist Realism</em>, 2009.</p>

<p>Weeks after Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin voted to kill a $15 minimum wage, they were rewarded with donations from the corporate lobby group leading the opposition to the measure, according to newly disclosed campaign finance records reviewed by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>
<p>Sinema and Manchin were <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lessons-from-todays-doomed-effort/">two of the eight Democrats</a> who voted with Republicans last month to block the Senate from even considering Sen. Bernie Sanders’ measure to fulfill Democrats’ campaign promise to raise the wage to $15. In the last week of March, $2,500 checks were delivered to both of them by the political action committee for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has been <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/testimony/testimony-raising-the-minimum-wage">running</a> the opposition campaign to the higher wage. Sinema also pulled in a $1,000 donation from the international law firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson, which has recently been <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e5806e34-df05-40b8-a97a-291ec1ca21b5/print/">lobbying</a> on <a href="https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/business-finance/upcoming-minimum-wage-hike-may-doom-tuna-canning-operations-in-american-samoa">wage issues</a> for food giant Starkist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kyrsten-sinema-defends-filibuster-as-pressure-mounts-from-progressives-11617714005">Sinema</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-manchin-filibuster-vote/2021/04/07/cdbd53c6-97da-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html">Manchin</a> have both raised objections to the idea of eliminating the Senate filibuster, and their stand serves other corporate interests that also recently poured cash into their campaign coffers. For example: The health care industry has been working to halt a public health insurance option, a measure that won’t get any support from Republicans.</p>
<p>In the last quarter alone, Sinema received $33,000 from the PACs of major health care, pharmaceutical, and insurance corporations and trade associations — including insurance group Blue Cross Blue Shield, hospital chains HCA Healthcare and LifePoint Health, and the hospital lobbying group Federation of American Hospitals. <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00486563/1510618/sa/ALL">Manchin</a> received PAC donations from Blue Cross as well as the American Hospital Association and Alston &amp; Bird, the latter of which <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/firms/summary?id=D000021817#">lobbies</a> for major health care industry clients.</p>
<p>Similarly, leaving the filibuster in place will likely put a halt to any major climate and environmental legislation. Sinema received $11,000 from PACs of large energy companies including electric utilities Duke Energy and Southern Company, while Manchin received donations from the PACs of Northwest Natural Gas ($2,500) and Greenberg Traurig ($4,000), which has lobbied for energy giants such as <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/12f5fcce-4212-4d0a-9ead-9cba87964cb5/print/">Peabody</a>, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/6cd9e370-8837-43f7-b8ad-670a0788e41f/print/">Centerpoint</a> and <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/79569e74-114a-475d-ba6d-eace0ca94d5e/print/">Covanta</a>.</p>

<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVES URGE BIG THINKING ON INFRASTRUCTURE: </strong>There is an <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-infrastructure-bill/">ongoing battle</a> in D.C over President Joe Biden’s new infrastructure plans. Congressional progressives are calling for a single ambitious spending package that addresses physical infrastructure as well as “care” infrastructure — things like child care and paid family leave — and invests $10 trillion in green energy over the next decade. Conservative Democrats, meanwhile, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporate-dems-show-progressives/">have threatened</a> to hold up any package unless it includes a tax cut for wealthy homeowners.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN FACES PRESSURE OVER YEMEN:</strong> Biden is <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-lawmakers-urge-biden-pressure-saudi-arabia-end-yemen-blockade">facing pressure</a> from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to bring about an end to Saudi Arabia’s blockade of Yemen, which has led to extreme famine and the <a href="https://www.wfp.org/yemen-crisis">world’s worst humanitarian crisis</a>. "Ending this practice will boost Yemen's economy, de-escalate the conflict, and prevent this humanitarian catastrophe from worsening — all important U.S. objectives,” lawmakers wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Earlier this month, 70 progressive lawmakers sent a similar letter to Biden, urging him to pressure Saudi Arabia into ending the blockade. The state department, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/14/22381459/yemen-blockade-saudi-arabia-biden-cnn">denies</a> there is a blockade in place.</p>
<p><strong>• WORLD LEADERS, NOBEL LAUREATES PUSH TO SUSPEND VAX PATENTS: </strong>A group of 175 former world leaders and Nobel laureates <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43fd53f5-2b82-4e41-981c-8544a6ce996b">are urging</a> Biden to waive the patents for COVID-19 vaccines in order to boost vaccination efforts globally as the pandemic continues to surges. Nearly 60 countries are backing a measure proposed at the World Trade Organization to allow nations to temporarily override patents for COVID-related medical products. The list of signatories includes former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, former French president François Hollande, and former president of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p><strong>• NANCY PELOSI BALKS AT COURT PACKING: </strong>Hours after congressional Democrats <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/14/house-and-senate-democrats-plan-bill-to-add-four-justices-to-supreme-court/">introduced legislation</a> to expand the number of Supreme Court justices from 9 to 13, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi poured cold water on the idea. Pelosi <a href="https://www.axios.com/pelosi-supreme-court-expansion-ceac17da-ef77-4e89-b248-c817c674bee1.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-supremecourt">said</a> she does not support the bill and would not bring it to the floor.</p>
