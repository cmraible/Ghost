<p>“The truth is the question of whether student debt should be canceled is largely irrelevant. Most student debt will be canceled sooner or later, because an ever-growing share of borrowers cannot possibly repay their loans.” –– <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/980889/secret-truth-student-debt-crisis">Ryan Cooper</a>, reporting for <em>The Week</em> on the student debt crisis.</p>

<p>Following President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-us-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan/2021/04/13/918c3cae-9beb-11eb-8a83-3bc1fa69c2e8_story.html">announcement</a> that the United States would be withdrawing all of its troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, more than two dozen antiwar groups sent a letter to the White House welcoming the decision and encouraging Biden to use it as a starting point for a more just foreign policy.</p>
<p>“The practice of endless war damages the security of the United States and causes untold suffering,” read the letter, which was led by Demand Progress, The Quincy Institute and Common Defense. “For these reasons, we support your important decision regarding Afghanistan and encourage you to make this the starting point for a profound reorientation of our foreign policy away from the overextension of military force and toward sustained diplomacy to meet the challenges of the 21st century.”</p>
<p>The signees noted that the administration's Afghanistan decision is backed by the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/552026-poll-two-thirds-support-afghanistan-withdrawal">vast majority</a> of Americans. “Polling after the announcement of the withdrawal decision also reflects the broad support of millions of Americans for the end of U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan,” said Adam Weinstein, an Afghanistan war veteran and research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a U.S. think tank.</p>
