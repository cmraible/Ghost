<p>As we previously announced, tonight at 8pm ET (5pm PT), <em>Daily Poster </em>subscribers will talk with New York State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and New York Assemblyman Ron Kim about Gov. Andrew Cuomo's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cuomos-legacy-normalizing-corruption-and-lawlessness/"><strong>resignation announcement</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Biaggi and Kim have been outspoken critics of the Cuomo administration, and they will sit down with David Sirota to discuss what his resignation means for New York, the Democratic Party, and the fight to rid the halls of power of abuse and corruption.</p>
