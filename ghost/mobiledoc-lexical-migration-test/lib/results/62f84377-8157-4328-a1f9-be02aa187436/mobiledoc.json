Right now, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai believe that they have to fight a civil case, which means spending money on lawyers and being deposed by government officials. But they will keep their wealth, and of course, their freedom, because they are personally not at risk, so scheming to dominate more markets elsewhere is a perfectly reasonable activity to pursue even while their companies are on trial. Violating the law by taking someone else’s livelihood risks, at worst, a parking ticket. But if these men were facing the prospect of personal criminal liability, then the stakes would suddenly shift.”"

Now states are asking for that money back."

I don’t think that kind of bad-faith criticism helps the cause of trying to guarantee health care to everyone. If we’re being honest and not just succumbing to virtue signaling or posturing, we should all admit that we pretty much know who the allies and opponents are in this battle. We should unrelentingly pressure everyone, but vilifying allies with personal invective probably does not help the cause."
