<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As the election approaches, I’ve got some news: we’re aiming to bring on more reporters and roll out some new subscriber-only content. But to make this happen and launch this expansion plan, we need as many free subscribers as possible to become supporting subscribers. So here’s my ask:</p>
<p><strong>Can you go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> and become a supporting subscriber?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you know we’ve been breaking open big stories every single week.</p>
<p>Just this morning we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/health-care-lobby-tries-to-buy-corporate">exposed</a> how a powerful health care lobby group is trying to get congressional Democrats and Republicans to pass a corporate immunity law. In the last few weeks, our reporting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-frantically-backtracks-after">forced</a> the Biden campaign to stop using GOP talking points about the deficit, successfully <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-limit-cuomos-corporate-immunity">pressured</a> state lawmakers to limit corporate immunity provisions and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trumps-usps-chair-grilled-after-tmi">helped</a> progressive Democrats in Congress hold Trump’s postal service appointees accountable.</p>
<p><strong>The only way we can do this kind of reporting is through grassroots funding. Our work is entirely supported by subscribers pitching in $5 a month or $50 a year. Please consider <a href="#/portal/signup">clicking here</a> to subscribe.</strong></p>

<p>I hate asking people for money, especially during tough times. But this is really important — we need hard-hitting accountability journalism now more than ever.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
