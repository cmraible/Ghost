<p>Friends:</p>
<p>There is a lot of dissatisfaction with corporate- and billionaire-owned media these days — but here’s the thing:</p>
<p><strong>If everyone who gets this email <a href="#/portal/signup">clicks here</a> to become a supporting subscriber to our grassroots-funded media outlet, we would be able to build an entire newsroom of reporters who hold politicians’ feet to the fire every single day.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been reading <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you see that our small team is breaking big stories and having a big impact — and we are trying to hire more reporters to expand that impact.</p>
<p><strong>We are 100% grassroots funded — so the only way we can do that is if folks like you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber. Those resources go directly to fund our journalism, and you also get all of our subscriber-only content.</strong></p>

<p>In just the last week, we busted open the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/billionaire-gop-donors-firm-reports/">story</a> of the GOP’s top Wall Street donor seeing his firm’s tax rate go below zero and we broke the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-amazon-covid-outbreak-followed/">story</a> of the Trump administration helping Amazon executives shut down a worker safety initiative during the pandemic. We’ve also held Democrats’ feet to the fire — we’ve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-have-a-scotus-opportunity-tomorrow/">reported</a> on all the ways they could try to stop Trump’s Supreme Court nominee but so far have refused.</p>
<p>Now imagine how much impact we could have if we had a full newsroom of reporters doing this work. It would be HUGE.</p>
<p><strong>We can do that if everyone who gets this email <a href="#/portal/signup">clicks here</a> to subscribe.</strong></p>
<p>We can hire reporters to aggressively cover elections, the next presidential administration, climate change, Wall Street and campaign finance. We can follow the money on every big story — and we can make a real impact on the political debate and the policy outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>We can do all of it if everyone who gets this email <a href="#/portal/signup">becomes a subscriber</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
