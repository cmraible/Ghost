<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It’s now almost two months since Joe Biden promised “immediate” $2,000 checks to millions of Americans struggling to survive. So far, the checks have not been forthcoming. Meanwhile, Democrats may be backing off their promise to enact a $15 minimum wage and significantly reduce student debt.</p>
<p>We’ve been reporting on all of these stories, and I’ll admit — it has not been pleasant. It’s not fun to wake up every day and report on news of capitulation and surrender. But it’s also not our job to pretend everything is fine when clearly it isn’t.</p>
<p>It’s not to say that there is no good news. Each week, we publish <em>You Love To See It</em>, which includes tons of great news about progress and action steps. But it is to say that as journalists, we have an obligation to tell our readers the truth, even if that truth is painful.</p>
<p>Of course, the struggle for social justice is never easy. There’s a two-steps-forward, one-step-back dynamic that always defines battles to to hold power accountable and make progress. So as you read our stories, keep in mind that if it were all easy and good news, it probably means that nothing is fundamentally changing.</p>
<p>We’re living through a tumultuous time of chaos and misinformation. But I remain hopeful that things are going to change for the better, and I feel that way because even in our reporting, you can see resistance, struggle, and action. There are good people in Congress, in state legislatures, and in communities all over this country fighting for real change — and the past assumptions about what is and what is not acceptable are changing.</p>
<p>I know <em>The Daily Poster</em> is playing a role in all of this — we’re making a real impact. You can see that in how our stories are being picked up by other media and in how far our stories travel. And I’m really proud we’re doing it a different way — we’re building a grassroots-funded news outlet whose entire structure is built to question and scrutinize power.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our team, and thank you for the work you are doing in your own communities to try to make things better. Don’t get despondent. Things are dark, but that’s because the struggle is getting closer and closer to the heart of power — and power does not like the prospect of change. But rest assured, change is coming.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
