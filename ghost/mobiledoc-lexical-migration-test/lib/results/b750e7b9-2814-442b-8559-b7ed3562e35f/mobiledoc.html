<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Three months ago, The Daily Poster was the media outlet that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/upcoming-scotus-climate-case-involves/">first broke the news</a> of Supreme Court nominee Amy Barrett’s familial ties to an oil giant at the center of a landmark climate case. That reporting warned everyone about this huge conflict, and helped shame Senate Democrats into asking  Barrett about the situation. Now, the case will now be heard this week — and the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/amy-coney-barrett-should-recuse-herself-from-big-oils-supreme-court-case">national media</a> is covering the question our reporting first raised: will she recuse herself?</p>
<p>This is the kind of impactful, original investigative reporting we are doing — and because we are grassroots funded, we cannot do it without your help.</p>
