<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>Last week was incredibly busy — we launched our new rebranded website here and we published a series of reports on the intensifying Supreme Court battle. Many of those reports went viral — and this morning, it seems like it has had a major effect. Check out this <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/27/democrats-supreme-court-confirmation-421849">Politico</a> story about how Senate Democrats are suddenly saying they will actually try to block Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.</p>
<p>We will have to wait to see whether this is an empty gesture or something real — but it’s important to recognize that the Democrats’ new posture follows significant pressure.</p>
<p>When The Daily Poster <a href="/aoc-to-schumer-we-must-use-every/">first</a> reported on the Supreme Court vacancy, Democrats were preemptively retreating. But after we broke open a series of stories that went viral, and after grassroots groups began mobilizing, they have changed their message.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to see our reporting generating such a huge audience — and I’m psyched that it is being <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/09/24/memo-laying-out-delay-tactics-circulates-among-senate-democrats/">cited</a> and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-senate-confirmation_n_5f6dfe7cc5b64deddeecee7a">recognized</a> by other major media outlets. It is no easy task to launch a 100% grassroots-funded media outlet — the deck is stacked against us in a lot of ways. But this week signaled that the grind is worth it. At least that’s what I tell myself when I am exhausted after the 80-hour work week.</p>
<p>In doing this work, I toggle between a sense of despondence and a feeling of excitement about future possibilities.</p>
<p>There are days where I look out on the media landscape and am reminded that while we have made a disproportionate impact and are growing, we are still a tiny operation in an ocean of noise. And it doesn’t make me feel any better to read a story like this one in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/business/media/substack-newsletters-journalists.html">New York Times</a> about how right-wing publications run by Iraq War proponents and promoters of disgusting race science are showered with millions of dollars to produce their propaganda.</p>
<p>But there are also days that I see our steady growth and our impact and feel like we are building something that can help change the game. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, but I can see a future where corporate- and billionaire-owned media is less dominant, and where grassroots-funded media is a bigger and bigger part of our democracy.</p>
<p>We’ve shown that’s possible. As a subscriber, your support is helping us try to make that vision a reality. Thank you for being part of the effort.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>

<p>• <strong><a href="https://medium.com/indica/i-lived-through-collapse-america-is-already-there-ba1e4b54c5fc">I Lived Through Collapse. America Is Already There.</a></strong> (Medium) — <em>“I lived through the end of a civil war. Do you know what it was like for me? Quite normal. I went to work, I went out, I dated. This is what Americans don’t understand. They’re waiting to get personally punched in the face while ash falls from the sky. That’s not how it happens. This is how it happens.

If Joe Biden wins the election, that expanded conservative majority on the court could create more legal jeopardy for his promised initiatives to strengthen emissions regulations and create new major ones.”</em></p>
