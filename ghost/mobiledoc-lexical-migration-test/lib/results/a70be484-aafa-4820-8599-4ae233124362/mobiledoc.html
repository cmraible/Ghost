<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Like so much of the economy, the journalism industry is being <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/vice-media-layoffs-155-employees-covid19-1234607610/">decimated</a><a href="https://www.axios.com/the-atlantic-layoffs-coronavirus-49cc6ad2-6579-45cd-b816-e20865f7351e.html">by layoffs</a>. This is terrible for our democracy, which needs a vibrant free press. To preserve and rebuild that free press, we are going to need to discard the billionaire- and corporate-funded model.</p>
<p><strong>We need grassroots-funded media, which is why I am asking you to <a href="#/portal/signup">click here to pitch in and support this project</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been reading TMI, you know we are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/war-is-peace-and-k-street-is-a-small">breaking open important stories</a> — and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/some-actual-good-news">having a real impact</a>. Thanks to paying subscribers, we’ve been able to bring on investigative journalist Andrew Perez. And if we can get a few hundred more subscribers, we are going to be able to further expand what we are doing — which will help us make even more of an impact.</p>
<p>I know times are tough right now — but if you are in a position to become a monthly or annual subscriber, <strong>I hope you’ll go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> and pitch in.</strong></p>
<p>You will be helping us expand what we are doing, at precisely a moment when we need hard-hitting reporting.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in politics and media for 20 years. I try not to ask folks to pitch in unless it is really important. I truly believe grassroots-funded media is crucial right now, which is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sirota">why I’m asking for your help</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request — and for helping create the media we so desperately need.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. Please share this email with anyone else that you think would be interested in becoming a subscriber. Grassroots-funded media means we rely on our audience for help spreading the word. You can also <a href="#/portal/signup?gift=true">click here to give someone a gift subscription</a>.</p>
