<p>“The fact remains that we have had an amazing 15 months,” noted Kevin Stevenson, CEO of the debt collection giant PRA Group, during the company’s earnings call this week, indicating the coronavirus’ global upheaval and devastation has meant good business for those who profit off consumer debt.</p>
<p>Stevenson neglected to note one bit of bad news in PRA Group’s otherwise banner year: The company is now under federal investigation for potentially violating predatory loan rules.

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>One of the biggest debt collectors in the country, PRA Group, <a href="https://www.accountsrecovery.net/2021/03/02/pra-group-discloses-cfpb-looking-into-possible-violations-of-consent-order/">announced</a> in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was facing an investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB recently <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-settles-lawsuit-debt-collectors-and-debt-buyers-encore-capital-group-midland-funding-midland-credit-management-and-asset-acceptance-capital-corp/">settled</a> a separate investigation into debt collection giant Encore. Both investigations center around possible violations of 2015 consent orders the companies entered into and involve predatory collection practices.</p>
<p>Under the 2015 order, PRA Group was <a href="https://www.accountsrecovery.net/2015/09/09/cfpb-takes-big-swing-at-encore-pra/">fined</a> $8 million and forced to refund $19 million to consumers, plus agreed to stop collections on more than $3 million worth of debts. The company has not reported which parts of the order it may have violated.</p>
<p>PRA Group has enjoyed booming profits during the pandemic and resulting recession, <a href="https://ir.pragroup.com/download/2021+Q1+Earnings_Presentation.pdf">setting </a>four quarterly global cash records since the beginning of 2020. During its <a href="https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1900/40849">earnings call</a> this week, company CEO Kevin Stevenson noted that “this pandemic is a human tragedy,” but later gushed: “The fact remains that we have had an amazing 15 months.”</p>
<p>Stevenson also highlighted the fact that a federal judge <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/05/05/federal-judge-vacates-cdcs-nationwide-eviction-moratorium/">recently struck down</a> the nationwide coronavirus-related eviction moratorium, and noted that the other pandemic moratoriums on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/16/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-extension-of-covid-19-forbearance-and-foreclosure-protections-for-homeowners/">house foreclosures</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/01/20/biden-student-loan-payment-freeze-extension/">federal student loan payments</a> are also set to expire.</p>
<p>“Our belief is that as these events occur, we may start to see the true impact of the pandemic on the U.S. consumer,” noted Stephenson. “This could very well mean increased delinquencies, followed by charge-offs and bankruptcies. And this is when PRA becomes the most important.”</p>
<p>News of PRA Group investigation comes as ACA International, the largest trade group for the debt collection industry, is <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/debt-collectors-are-spending-big-to-block-a-crackdown?via=twitter_page">lobbying against new legislation</a> to limit debt collection practices at a time when consumer and medical debt have skyrocketed due to the pandemic. The bill recently passed the House, shepherded by Rep. Maxine Waters.</p>
<p>While the GOP pushed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/15/republicans-are-hypocrites-they-happily-de-funded-the-police-we-actually-need">slash CFPB funding</a> during the presidency of Donald Trump to the point where the agency said it could not “keep pace with the evolving consumer product marketplace,” President Joe Biden has signaled his interest in reinvigorating the agency by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/biden-s-cfpb-nominee-rohit-chopra-brings-substantive-regulatory-expertise-n1259257">nominating</a> consumer advocate Rohit Chopra to head the organization. Chopra’s nomination is awaiting a Senate vote.</p>

<p><strong>• ELON MUSK BACKS OFF BITCOIN: </strong>On Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company would no longer accept Bitcoin for purchases, citing concerns about the carbon energy use in its mining. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">In February</a>, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and announced it would accept it for financial transactions. Musk even went so far as to add the hashtag #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio. However, concerns about Bitcoin’s carbon footprint are not new. For years, scientists have been <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/10/181029130951.htm">warning</a> that Bitcoin mining alone could push the world beyond the 2 degrees Celsius of warming needed for climate devastation.</p>
<p><strong>• KOCH-BACKED GROUP WEIGH IN TO HELP BIG PHARMA:</strong> As Americans face skyrocketing drug prices, Americans For Prosperity (AFP), the political advocacy group founded by Charles and David Koch, <a href="https://thebrick.house/koch-group-fights-drug-price-reforms-after-taking-big-pharma-money/">announced</a> it would spend six figures to stop a push to include a drug pricing measure in Biden’s American Families Plan. The money will go toward an ad buy targeting key districts with moderate Democrats and will focus on the impact such reform would have on biotech innovation.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN STILL WANTS RAHM: </strong>Biden <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rahm-emanuel-biden-japan-ambassador-nomination-1167927/">will appoint</a> former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to be the United States ambassador to Japan. Emanuel is a controversial figure. When he was mayor, city officials suppressed video footage of the fatal shooting of Black teenager Laquan McDonald.. Emanuel’s record <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/11/rahm-emanuel-joe-biden-cabinet-chicago-mayor">previously</a> prevented him from obtaining a cabinet position. News that he was being considered for transportation secretary sparked backlash from progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
<p><strong>• CLYBURN UNDERCUTS POLICE REFORM: </strong>House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., has <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/jim-clyburn-undercuts-democratic-police-reform-bill/">undercut</a> his own party’s efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, suggesting that ending qualified immunity for police officers — the bill’s key provision — is not necessary. On CNN, the South Carolina kingmaker said, “If we don’t get qualified immunity now, then we will come back and try to get it later. But I don’t want to see us throw out a good bill because we can’t get a perfect bill.”</p>
