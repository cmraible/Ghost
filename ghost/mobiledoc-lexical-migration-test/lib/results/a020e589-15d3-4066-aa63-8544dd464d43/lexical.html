<p>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/democrats-labor-business-monopoly/"><strong>Why the Left Should Ally With Small Business</strong></a> (The Nation) — <em>“Independent businesses have been crushed by the same concentration of corporate power that has debilitated unions. It’s not simply that these groups have common enemies, from Amazon to Tyson Foods. It’s that having a robust small-business sector disperses power, which has significant economic and political benefits for working people. Rebuilding small businesses is thus crucial to achieving the left’s vision of broad prosperity and a thriving democracy.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160500/elon-musks-big-government-grift"><strong>Elon Musk’s Big Government Grift</strong></a> (New Republic) — <em>“Elon Musk’s growing footprint in (Texas) is just the latest step in his lifelong mission, which he’s long since accomplished, to get unimaginably rich by maximally gaming the government’s largesse—even, we now know, taking advantage of programs meant to help people who earn in a lifetime what he earns every minute.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://joesanberg.substack.com/p/tikkun-olam-in-the-time-of-covid"><strong>Tikkun Olam In The Time Of COVID-19</strong></a> (Horizon) - <em>“In Judaism, we’re told that our most urgent calling in this life is to serve – that each of us is obligated to do everything in our power to right wrongs and heal the world, or, Tikkun Olam. It’s a pretty tall order. And I’m the first to admit that healing the world often falls to the bottom of the list when you have family obligations, work to take care of, and dishes to wash. But Hanukkah gives us a chance to re-center. To ground ourselves in the lessons of the Torah, which reminds us of the enduring story of resilience and optimism.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160481/neal-katyal-depravity-big-law"><strong>Neal Katyal and the Depravity of Big Law</strong></a> (New Republic) — <em>“Neal Katyal is among the most prominent and decorated attorneys in the country. He is a Democrat who has been in and out of government since Bill Clinton’s second term. He returned to his private firm, Hogan Lovells, after serving as acting solicitor general for Barack Obama’s Justice Department. He is omnipresent on television and newspaper op-ed pages as a voice of “The Resistance” to Donald Trump. He is about as close as you could come to the embodiment of Big Law’s connection to the institutional Democratic Party. And last week he argued that because the corporation that supplied Zyklon B to the Nazis for use in their extermination camps was not indicted at Nuremberg, Nestle and Cargill should not be held liable for their use of child slave labor.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/new-york-city-drivers-cooperative-uber-lyft"><strong>New York City Drivers Cooperative Aims to Smash Uber’s Exploitative Model</strong></a> (In These Times) — <em>A new organization called The Drivers Cooperative "aims to real­ize a long-held dream of social­ly con­scious New York­ers in a hur­ry: a rideshar­ing app that you can feel good about. When it rolls out to the pub­lic ear­ly next year, TDC will become New York City’s first work­er-owned rideshar­ing plat­form — owned by the dri­vers them­selves, rather than by big investors and exec­u­tives. Its founders’ brazen idea is that TDC can actu­al­ly gain a com­pet­i­tive advan­tage over Uber and Lyft — sav­ing mon­ey and fun­nel­ing those sav­ings back to dri­vers — by doing away with the most exploita­tive prac­tices of that dom­i­nant duop­oly.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/puerto-rico-privatization-prepa/"><strong>Privatizing Puerto Rico</strong></a> (The Nation) — <em>An update on the brutal austerity and privatization agenda being imposed on the island.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/10/pandemic-shoplifting-hunger/"><strong>Stealing To Survive</strong></a> (Washington Post) — <em>“The coronavirus recession has been a relentless churn of high unemployment and economic uncertainty. The government stimulus that kept millions of Americans from falling into poverty earlier in the pandemic is long gone, and new aid is still a dot on the horizon after months of congressional inaction. Hunger is chronic, at levels not seen in decades. The result is a growing subset of Americans who are stealing food to survive.”</em></p>

<p>Friends:</p>
<p>When I started this newsletter back in April, I didn’t have huge expectations — I wanted to get back to writing, and didn’t really know if anyone would be interested in the journalism I was doing. Eight months later, we’ve created a fully operational accountability journalism outlet, breaking news and making a big impact, week in and week out.</p>
<p>I am pleasantly surprised that we’ve had such success — I had my doubts about the possibilities of building a grassroots-funded news outlet. But we made the decision to try it, and I decided I didn’t want to make the project all about me. You’ll notice that we are one of the relatively few newsletters that doesn’t revolve around one single writer.</p>
<p>That’s not an accident — I believe that we need more sustainable news <em>outlets</em>, not necessarily more individual-centric projects. Trying to build an outlet is a lot harder than just doing a single blog — it takes a lot more work managing the content flow, editing different writers and doing all the stuff necessary to build a sustainable organization. But in my view, it is worth it — because the only way to build something at scale is to try to make it bigger than oneself and build a team.</p>
<p>That’s what we’ve been able to do — and we couldn’t do it without <em>you</em> as part of the team.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the future holds for media, but I do know that we are trying to build a whole new model — a newsroom that answers only to readers. That’s an extremely rare thing in this world — and it would be a revolutionary success, if we can make it happen.</p>
<p>As dark a time as it is right now, <em>The Daily Poster</em> fills me with a sense of optimism — it is proving that we can build something newer and better, and that we don’t just have to settle for the old broken models that have dominated the media landscape. Thank you for being a part of this.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
