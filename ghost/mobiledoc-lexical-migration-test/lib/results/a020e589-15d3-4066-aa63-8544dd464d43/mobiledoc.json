It’s not simply that these groups have common enemies, from Amazon to Tyson Foods.

Rebuilding small businesses is thus crucial to achieving the left’s vision of broad prosperity and a thriving democracy.”"

He is omnipresent on television and newspaper op-ed pages as a voice of “The Resistance” to Donald Trump. He is about as close as you could come to the embodiment of Big Law’s connection to the institutional Democratic Party. And last week he argued that because the corporation that supplied Zyklon B to the Nazis for use in their extermination camps was not indicted at Nuremberg, Nestle and Cargill should not be held liable for their use of child slave labor.”"

Eight months later, we’ve created a fully operational accountability journalism outlet, breaking news and making a big impact, week in and week out."

But we made the decision to try it, and I decided I didn’t want to make the project all about me. You’ll notice that we are one of the relatively few newsletters that doesn’t revolve around one single writer."

Trying to build an outlet is a lot harder than just doing a single blog — it takes a lot more work managing the content flow, editing different writers and doing all the stuff necessary to build a sustainable organization. But in my view, it is worth it — because the only way to build something at scale is to try to make it bigger than oneself and build a team."
