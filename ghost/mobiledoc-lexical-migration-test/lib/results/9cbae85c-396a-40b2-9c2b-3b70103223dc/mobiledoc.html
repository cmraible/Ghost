<p>Texas is poised to kill more of its own citizens. No, not with the death penalty — we knew that already — but with its reliance on poorly regulated fossil fuel energy. Also, the Biden administration is dragging its feet on preventing a major wave of housing evictions, while signs are mounting that the country may not have won its battle with COVID-19 just yet. All that and much more in today’s Midday Poster below, exclusively for subscribers.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>Texas’ go-it-alone, largely unregulated power grid, which relies heavily on fossil fuels, is at risk of failing again from severe weather caused by climate change.</p>
<p>This February, a series of snowstorms caused blackouts that <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/539348-millions-still-without-power-and-winter-storm-moves-on-from-texas#:~:text=At%20least%202.7%20million%20Texas,their%20homes%20or%20intermittent%20service.&amp;text=Texas%20Gov.">left millions without heat</a> and killed an <a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2021/05/27/data-driven-report-says-700-died-in-texas-february-power-outages-not-the-151-reported-by-the-state">estimated 700 Texans</a>. As <em>The Daily Poster</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-texas-winter-blackouts/">reported</a> at the time, “The blackouts [were] mainly brought on by a shortage of natural gas due to a drop in pressure and frozen instruments at fossil fuel and nuclear facilities, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/frozen-wind-farms-were-just-a-small-piece-of-texas-s-power-woes">according<strong></strong>to</a> the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).” Following the storms, Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas lawmakers sought to fix the problems — implementing, among other things, new weatherization requirements with million-dollar penalties for noncompliance. Still, as <em>Texas Monthly</em><a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-electric-grid-legislature/">noted</a>, the package of reforms was “significantly narrower” than originally planned.</p>
<p>Despite those efforts, the state’s power grid is <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article252107503.html">straining again under the weight of an extreme heat wave</a>. Already, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/unplanned-outages-hit-texas-power-plants-amid-soaring-temperatures-n1270827">outages have experts concerned</a>. ERCOT, the organization that manages the grid, is urging Texans to reduce their energy consumption in the hopes of keeping the system up and running.</p>

<p>The weather is unlikely to get more manageable. As climate change progresses, brought on by fossil fuel consumption, weather patterns are getting more extreme — particularly in southern states like Texas. A 2016 <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-tx.pdf">report</a> by the EPA noted that Texas could expect hotter and drier summers.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>The notorious Delta COVID-19 variant, which spreads more easily and leads to more severe cases than other versions of coronavirus, now accounts for<strong> nearly 10 percent </strong>of all new COVID-19 cases in the United States. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/newly-deemed-variant-concern-delta-accounts-10-percent-u-s-n1270915">That number is rising</a>, as it is in the rest of the world. Meanwhile, just <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-population-vaccinated-march-15.html#:~:text=As%20of%206%20a.m.%20EDT,according%20to%20the%20CDC's%20data.">43.9 percent</a> of Americans are fully vaccinated against the virus and states across the country are lifting COVID restrictions and declaring it’s time to return to normal.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>On July 15, 1996, <em>Time </em>Magazine ran a <a href="http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19960715,00.html">big story</a> about how American political consultants, with the support of the Clinton administration, saved Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s presidency in a tough election. “Yanks to the Rescue,” read the cover.</p>
<p>Until the U.S. got involved, Yeltsin’s popularity was in a tailspin due to how his U.S.-backed neoliberal economic policies were wreaking havoc on the Russian economy.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>• JOE MANCHIN APPEALS TO RICH DONORS TO SAVE THE FILIBUSTER: </strong>In <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/16/joe-manchin-leaked-billionaire-donors-no-labels/">leaked audio</a> obtained by <em>The Intercept</em>, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) urged big-money donors from Joe Lieberman’s <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/80058/sticking-point-no-labels-republicans-democrats-centrist">corporate shill group</a> No Labels to pressure Republicans into backing the January 6 Commission in order to strip the left of its best argument for removing the filibuster. Manchin urged donors to lean on Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) in particular, noting his impending retirement and hinting that someone could offer him a lucrative private-sector job on his way out. Meanwhile, Manchin is now <a href="https://readsludge.com/2021/06/16/manchins-proposal-cuts-campaign-finance-and-ethics-reforms-from-s-1/">pushing for a weaker version of the For The People Act</a>, the Democrats’ ambitious voting bill. His version would not include public financing provisions or an ethics rule banning legislators from serving on the boards of for-profit companies.</p>
<p><strong>• STATES PROTECT DARK MONEY DONORS: </strong>This year, four states <a href="https://readsludge.com/2021/06/15/new-laws-preventing-dark-money-disclosure-are-sweeping-the-nation/">passed laws</a> making it illegal for government agencies to require nonprofits to disclose their donors, according to <em>Sludge</em>. Arkansas, Iowa, South Dakota, and Tennessee now join five other states where lawmakers passed bills preemptively protecting dark money groups. Meanwhile, other similar bills are working their way through legislatures across the country. The penalties for violating the statutes and disclosing dark money donors in some instances include prison time.</p>
<p><strong>• DEM. GOVERNOR COULD BLOCK STATE UTILITY TAKEOVER: </strong>The Maine State Senate just <a href="https://www.wabi.tv/2021/06/17/maine-senate-approves-bill-create-pine-tree-power-company/">passed a bill</a> that would allow state residents to vote to create a new nonprofit that would take over the state’s electric utilities. Central Maine Power is <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/11/14/cmp-ranks-as-lowest-rated-utility-in-the-country-among-business-customers/">deeply unpopular</a> in the state, and supporters say the measure will mean cheaper and cleaner energy. However, the state’s Democratic Gov. Janet Mills is reportedly skeptical of the legislation and could veto it. Opposition to the proposed nonprofit is <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2021/05/20/politics/daily-brief/public-power-utility-backers-have-hard-path-to-maines-2021-ballot/">being led</a> by a group created by the Maine Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>• SINEMA DEFENDS FILIBUSTER AS CLIMATE CHANGE RAVAGES ARIZONA: </strong>Conservative Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has been one of the leading voices against filibuster reform, even though it would stop Republicans from holding up vital legislation like climate change bills. It hasn’t seemed to matter to Sinema that Arizona, the state she represents, is experiencing a historic drought fueled by global warming, and summers in the region have become increasingly punishing. Water levels at the Lake Mead reservoir, located in Arizona and Utah, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/17/us/lake-mead-drought-water-shortage-climate/index.html">have reached a new low</a> after dropping more than 130 feet in two decades. Arizona State Fire Management Officer John Truettis has even warned that firefighters <a href="https://twitter.com/aaron4az/status/1405241928170409985?s=21">cannot</a> dispatch helicopters to scoop water out of lakes and reservoirs to fight wildfires, due to water levels being so low.</p>
<p><strong>• FOOD COMPANIES WIN CHILD SLAVERY LAWSUIT: </strong>The Supreme Court <a href="https://twitter.com/scotusblog/status/1405528925690679300?s=21">sided</a> with Nestle and Cargill in a lawsuit brought by former child slaves from Mali who alleged that the food companies aided and abetted child slavery by purchasing cocoa from African cocoa farms on the Ivory Coast. A lower court ruling had allowed claims to proceed under the Alien Tort Statute, a decision the high court reversed.</p>
