<p>As progressive icon Nina Turner racks up <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2021/04/27/nina-turner-receives-more-local-endorsements-in-oh-11-race--">local</a><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/03/cleveland-mayor-frank-jackson-endorses-nina-turner-for-11th-district-congressional-election.html">endorsements</a> and surges in the polls in a closely watched congressional race, Washington lobbyists and business-friendly Democrats are working to try to block her victory in the August 3 Democratic primary for Ohio’s 11th congressional district.</p>
<p>Last week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/16/hilary-clinton-ohio-special-election-494953">endorsed</a> Turner’s opponent, Shontel Brown, in what observers saw as a response to Turner’s association with Bernie Sanders. On that same day, lobbyists and a corporate-aligned Democratic House coalition hosted a fundraiser to boost Brown, after a poll sponsored by Turner’s campaign found her with a commanding 50-15 lead in the race.</p>
<p><em>Punchbowl</em><a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorPopielarz/status/1405121330433957888">posted an invite</a> last week for the fundraising reception “honoring” Brown. Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., a caucus vice-chair of the corporate New Democrat Coalition in the House, was listed as a special guest at the event. The coalition’s PAC, NewDem Action Fund, was listed as a host.</p>
<p>The fundraising invite says the “host committee in formation” for the event was Protecting Our Vote Federal PAC, a voter rights-oriented political action committee (PAC). The organization has an affiliated super PAC, called Protecting Our Vote PAC, that has made small <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/independent-expenditures/?data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00509463&amp;is_notice=true&amp;most_recent=true">independent expenditures</a> supporting Brown.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.protectingourvote.org/about/">its website</a>, Protecting Our Vote is “building a state-of-the-art research, digital, and communications infrastructure” in order “to mobilize, persuade and turn out every African-American possible on the issues that impact their communities and affect their lives.”</p>
<p>The super PAC’s treasurer is Marcus Mason, a corporate lobbyist who is also listed as a host of the event. Mason’s clients include Fox News parent company <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/34f67d61-42cc-4320-ac13-498a70db3f88/print/">Fox Corp</a>, private equity giant <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/b0d0529d-f63e-4686-bac0-1322efc6f85a/print/">Carlyle Group</a>, student loan servicer <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/02321188-c463-4e79-826e-117ecb2ea860/print/">Navient</a>, the <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/3b017360-68c5-46fc-91ce-6863ac615e0a/print/">National Alliance for Public Charter Schools</a>; tech giant <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/09c725b7-001a-4b9b-b3c8-fa1fe9b054a5/print/">Google</a>, and gig delivery company <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/91817702-b633-4734-a65c-4017f7795dd5/print/">DoorDash</a>.</p>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/ninaturner"><em>The Daily Poster </em>live chat</a> last month, Turner explained her inspiration for running for office.</p>
<p>“What came after the Gilded Age? The progressive era,” she said. “We are doing that same dance in the 21st century. That just increases my resolve to do what I am doing right now, which is to fight his fight, both in a movement capacity and run for office yet again, to be able to use that platform to do a whole lot of good for a whole lot of people.”</p>
