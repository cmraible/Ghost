<p>On Friday, the Federal Election Commission voted to close election complaints filed against a pro-Trump super PAC and a dark money policy group for allegedly illegally coordinating with Trump officials during the 2020 campaign. But according to records of the case, the specifics of the complaints were so egregious that one of the commissioners noted election rules are now at risk of becoming completely meaningless.</p>

<p>Prices for new drugs have <strong>doubled</strong> since 2005, according to <a href="https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/duke-fuqua-insights/david-ridley-launch-prices-new-drugs-have-doubled-2005">new research</a> from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. The research attributes the price increases, in part, to the “perverse incentive” created by Medicare Part B’s formula for reimbursements for prescription drugs. According to the formula, the government reimburses pharmaceutical manufacturers based on the wholesale cost of the drug, so providers have no incentive to lower costs.</p>

<p>Last Friday, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) voted to <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/matter-under-review/7340/">close complaints</a> against the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and the Trump dark money policy group America First Policies.</p>
<p>The complaints, in the aggregate, alleged that America First Action and America First Policies had been established and controlled by former President Donald Trump’s agents or Trump officials who then illegally solicited unlimited contributions to the super PAC. Additionally, they alleged that both groups had illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>Before closing the case, three members of the commission had voted to look into the complaints, but they fell one vote short of moving forward with the investigation. Ellen Weintraub, one of the commissioners who voted to investigate, noted in a <a href="https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/murs/7609/7609_12.pdf">statement of reasons</a> that she believed that the groups had illegally solicited donations in violation of federal campaign finance law, and illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“Limits and prohibitions on candidate contributions become meaningless if campaigns can work with outside groups financed in large part by dark money,” Weintraub wrote. “Nevertheless, two of my colleagues voted to dismiss the matters entirely. With one recusal, once again, the Commission did not have the required four votes to even investigate allegations of potentially multi-million dollar violations.”</p>
<p>According to Brendan Fischer, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that works to reduce the influence of money in politics, the FEC has a recent history of narrowly interpreting rules designed to limit coordination between campaigns and outside groups.</p>
<p>“I think this is an example of why the coordination rules need to be strengthened, and the For The People Act does include a pretty robust overhaul of the coordination rules,” Fischer told <em>The Daily Poster.</em> “The Trump super PAC and Trump dark money group would very likely not be considered independent if S. 1 [the “For the People Act”] were the law.”</p>

<p>Fischer said that the issue of Trump soliciting donations for the super PAC is a more obvious violation of campaign finance law. The FEC’s own staff attorneys recommended that the commissioners find that the law had been violated.</p>
<p>But based on the complaint records, Fischer believes the Trump campaign expected all along to avoid penalties, thanks to their friends on the FEC.</p>
<p>“If you look at the Trump campaign response to the solicitation complaint, they really make no effort to defend what they did,” he said. “It seemed like they were just banking on the Republican FEC commissioners shielding the campaign from any accountability for violating the law.”</p>

One of the key federal policy proposals to tackle climate change, a <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14062021/biden-infrastructure-clean-electricity-standard-manchin/">clean electricity standard</a>, doesn’t have support from a single Republican senator.

    <li><strong>CLIMATE RISK: </strong>One dozen states attorneys general submitted a <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Final%20SEC%20Climate%20Disclosure%20Comment%20Letter%20-%20061421.pdf">public comment</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, encouraging the agency to adopt a proposed rule requiring companies to disclose the risks posed to them by climate change. “States have a deep interest in climate-related disclosures to ensure their citizens have adequate, accurate information about their investments — including college savings, life savings, pensions, and retirement accounts — that face exposure from companies experiencing climate risk,” noted the letter. “And states themselves are investors, with billions of dollars invested in U.S. securities through, for example, their pension programs.” While such a rule would be an important step in tackling the climate crisis, it wouldn’t apply to private equity firms, which are <a href="https://citywireselector.com/news/private-equity-picks-up-fossil-fuel-assets-as-others-divest/a1512779">increasingly buying up</a> fossil fuel assets being abandoned by companies concerned about climate risk.</li>
    <li><strong>CHIPOTLE LIES: </strong>Chipotle, the fast-casual restaurant chain, raised prices this month in order to pay for what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-hiking-prices-across-menu-to-offset-higher-wages-2021-6">the company claimed</a> were wage increases for workers. However, when the company recently granted its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/chipotle-s-bosses-get-extra-64-4-million-from-tweak-to-results">executives major pay increases</a>, it did not raise prices to cover those costs.
