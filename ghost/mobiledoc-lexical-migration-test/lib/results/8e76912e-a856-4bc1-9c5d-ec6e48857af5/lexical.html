<p>The Sackler family used their company Purdue Pharma to get rich off the opioid crisis. Now, as part of the corporation’s bankruptcy proceedings, the clan is angling to score immunity not just for its family members, but also its empire of lawyers, foundations, investors, shell companies, and even other opioid manufacturers, according to new documents reviewed by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>

<p>The Sackler Family, which made a fortune off the opioid crisis through their company Purdue Pharma, is asking a federal court to grant sweeping legal immunity to their family and more than 1,000 parties linked to the family and the scandal, including one of their companies peddling opioids across the globe, according to new court records reviewed by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>
<p>The immunity request was filed by Purdue lawyers on Wednesday as part of a larger disclosure in the opioid giant’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. Members of the Sackler family are seeking the liability shields in exchange for contributing slightly more than $4 billion to a bankruptcy settlement. That payoff might sound like a lot, but it’s not much compared to the fact that the public health care cost of the opioid epidemic was $1 trillion in 2017 alone. In the end, the Sackler family could retain billions.</p>
<p>If the court blesses the requested releases — and if Congress does not quickly pass pending legislation to halt such immunity — government officials would be prevented from bringing opioid-related lawsuits against not only Sackler family members and their businesses, but also against the Sacklers’ army of lawyers, family trusts, foundations, investors, film companies, Bermuda-based shell companies, and even other pharmaceutical companies that manufacture and sell opioids. </p>

<p>A new analysis by <em>Science Advances</em> has <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabe1178">found</a> that COVID lockdowns and business closures led to 95,000 fewer global air-pollution deaths. The effects varied by country; in Europe and the United States, which never implemented full lockdowns and reopened relatively quickly, the drop in deaths was negligible. Still, in March 2020, emergency measures around the world resulted in as much as a 50-percent reduction in nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the air. Concentrations of particulate matter in the air also dropped by 30 percent.</p>

<p>It has been 88 years since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Glass Steagall Act, separating commercial and investment banking and establishing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Roosevelt <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/glass-steagall-act">signed</a> the bill into law on June 16, 1933. The separation of commercial banking and investment banking would remain in effect until another Democrat, President Bill Clinton, signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, effectively repealing Glass Steagall. The repeal is considered <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112shrg66052/pdf/CHRG-112shrg66052.pdf">one of the causes</a> of the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis.</p>

<p><strong>• REP. KATIE PORTER ENDORSES NINA TURNER:</strong> Prominent Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/katie-porter-elizabeth-warren-endorsement/index.html">broke for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)</a> in the 2020 presidential race, <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryJGomez/status/1397203518138765317?s=20">endorsed</a> former Bernie Sanders surrogate Nina Turner for Congress on Tuesday. Turner, who co-chaired Sanders’ 2020 campaign, is running in a special election in Ohio’s 11th district. Voting takes place on November 2.</p>
<p><strong>• DEMS DEFEAT BERNIE SANDERS’ BID TO STOP BIDEN’S ISRAEL ARMS SALE: </strong>Bernie Sanders (Ind.-Vt.) <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/555491-sanders-drops-bid-to-block-bidens-israel-arms-sale">dropped</a> a resolution to block Biden’s arms sales to Israel after the measure failed to acquire <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/19/cosponsors">any co-sponsors</a>. The sale had already been finalized by the State Department and the resolution <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-israel-gaza-weapons-b1854270.html">may not have done anything to block it</a>. Sanders also dropped a hold he had placed on State Department nominees after Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman discussed the administration’s efforts to end violence in Gaza.</p>
<p><strong>• KIM KARDASHIAN WEST SUED BY UNDERPAID STAFF: </strong>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/26/kim-kardashian-west-lawsuit-workers-staff-pay-conditions">new lawsuit</a> in California from seven members of billionaire Kim Kardashian West’s staff claims the celebrity influencer did not pay overtime, cover expenses, or allow legally-mandated work breaks. The suit also claims Kardashian West withheld 10 percent of the staff’s earnings for taxes, but never reported their employment to the proper authorities. In March, speaking out against body shaming, Kardashian West <a href="https://www.celebritykind.com/kindness/kim-kardashian-reflects-on-how-media-body-shaming-broke-her-during-pregnancy/">encouraged</a> people to “lead with kindness.”</p>
<p><strong>• STATE-LEVEL REPUBLICANS TAKE STAND AGAINST FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS: </strong>Michigan’s GOP-controlled state house passed <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/concurrentresolutionadopted/House/pdf/2021-HACRH-0005.pdf">a resolution</a> calling the For The People Act (H.R. 1), which Congressional Democrats passed without a single Republican vote in March, “a massive overreach into state election administration.” Michigan Republicans are not alone. In New Hampshire, a top Republican state house member is <a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/bill_docket.aspx?lsr=0999&amp;sy=2021&amp;txtsessionyear=2021&amp;txtbillnumber=sb89&amp;sortoption=">seeking to amend an election bill</a> to create a bifurcated election system with different rules for state and federal elections <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/new-hampshire-for-the-people-act-workaround-voting-rights">as a workaround</a> to H.R. 1.</p>
<p><strong>• KAMALA HARRIS, NEOLIBERAL: </strong>Vice President Kamala Harris has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-taps-private-sector-to-invest-in-central-america-11622113201">unveiled her plan</a> to help rebuild Central America to stem the tide of migrants at the border — and it all comes down to private-sector investment. “We must think beyond government,” Harris told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The VP is encouraging American companies like Mastercard and Microsoft to invest in countries like El Salvador and Guatemala and establish business there. Some of those efforts involve setting up public services like broadband, but rather than having governments run the services, the programs would be in the hands of American corporations. The investments would be coupled with anti-corruption measures aimed at local governments. If the plan sounds familiar, it’s because we have a word for such reforms: “neoliberalism.”</p>
