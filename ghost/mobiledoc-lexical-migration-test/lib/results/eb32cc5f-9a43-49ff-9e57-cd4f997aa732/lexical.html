<p><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></p>
<p>Richard Branson declared victory in the billionaire space race on Sunday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/11/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-live-updates/">launching himself</a> more than 50 miles into orbit in a spaceship designed by his company Virgin Galactic. Billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/tech/jeff-bezos-richard-branson-elon-musk-space-race-scn/index.html">reportedly</a> not far behind.</p>
<p>While Bezos’s newspaper <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/13/billionaires-space-race-benefits-rest-us-really/">is arguing</a> that privatized space exploration is “an enduring contribution to humanity,” what is obscured is that Bezos, Branson, and Musk’s space travel is effectively subsidized by American taxpayers and the loopholes provided to billionaires.</p>
<p>Branson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-06/branson-shifts-1-1-billion-galactic-holding-between-tax-havens?utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">shifted $1.1 billion in assets</a> last year from his United States-based space exploration company to the British Virgin Islands, where residents don’t pay any income or capital gains taxes. Around the same time, he <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52431290">demanded a bailout</a> from the UK government for his airline.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">recent investigation</a> by ProPublica, Bezos and Musk are even more blatant tax evaders. In 2007 and 2011, Bezos — now the richest person in the world — didn’t pay a single dollar in federal income taxes. In 2018, Musk — the second-richest — also paid no federal income taxes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the companies that made them rich have collected billions of dollars in subsidies. Amazon has been awarded at least <a href="https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/blog/taxpayer-subsidies-amazon-now-exceed-37-billion">$3.7 billion</a> in state and local tax subsidies since it was founded, and likely much more because some subsidy deals are kept confidential.</p>
<p>As of 2015, Musk’s companies had received a combined <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html">$4.9 billion</a> in government subsidies. Since then, Tesla has been offered over a billion in tax breaks to build warehouses in <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-tsla-tax-breaks-texas-gigafactory-cybertruck">Texas</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk">Nevada</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-received-government-coronavirus-bailout-elon-musk-stimulus-relief-criticism-2020-7">government COVID-19 bailout</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></p>
<p>Venture capitalist and Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1414029247446982658">tweeted</a> over the weekend about his concern about traveling to New York: “I have to go to New York soon and I'm trying to figure out where to stay. I have heard it's disgusting and violent there.”</p>
<p>In 2018, Vance visited New York City’s posh Pierre Hotel to talk to the Bank Policy Institute, a Washington lobbying group for big banks, about his book, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>. At the event, Vance and a bank lobbyist mused about why some people live in poverty and whether that’s because they don’t regularly go to church.</p>

<p><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>“WILDLY DISHONEST” ATTACKS ON NINA TURNER: </strong>A Democratic super PAC that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/02/01/iowa-bernie-sanders-democratic-majority-for-israel-mark-mellman/">attacked</a> Bernie Sanders during the 2020 presidential campaign is now <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202107099451001821">spending</a> hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads opposing Nina Turner in the Cleveland congressional race. The attacks are coming from DMFI PAC, a pro-Israel super PAC whose biggest <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202001319184681294">donor</a> last election cycle was Stacy Schusterman, <a href="https://www.samsonco.com/executive_team.aspx">the chairman</a> of an <a href="https://www.samsonco.com/executive_team.aspx">oil and gas company</a>. DMFI PAC’s <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/13/democratic-super-pac-condemned-sleazy-and-false-attacks-nina-turner">latest mailers accuse</a> Turner of opposing universal health care and a minimum wage hike. The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1414703858849300485">called</a> the mailers “wildly dishonest.”</li>
    <li><strong>PIPELINE DRILLING ESCALATES UNDER BIDEN:</strong> President Joe Biden’s administration is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-science-environment-and-nature-6ac8ff49970e4b052489678b40e3ba82">on track</a> to approve more drilling permits than any president since George W. Bush. The Interior Department has approved more than 2,100 drilling permits since Biden took office. The Biden administration has taken a moderate approach to cutting down fossil fuel production with an executive order to pause new leases for drilling on public lands. However, a federal court struck down the order and most of the country’s fossil fuel reserves are already under lease. As <em>The Daily Poster</em> previously <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-weak-pause-on-drilling-permits/">reported</a>, “fossil fuel companies sought and received approval for <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/10/oil-companies-drilling-permits-biden-climate/">thousands of drilling permits</a> on millions of acres of federal land during the Trump years, which they can develop at any time.” In other words, the order would not have made a big difference anyway. Meanwhile, conservative Democrats in the Senate — Chris Coons (Del.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), and Jon Tester (Mont.) — are raking in ExxonMobil cash <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/13/campaign-disclosures-show-senate-dems-exxonmobil-expose-got-almost-333000">according to</a> an analysis by Oil Change U.S.</li>
    <li><strong>RICHIE NEAL’S PAID LEAVE PLAN EXCLUDES MANY MOMS: </strong>There’s a <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/07/14/neal-paid-leave-plan-excludes-42-of-new-mothers/">new alternative</a> to the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, which would guarantee paid leave to those workers who meet certain criteria. Under the old proposal, 30 percent of new parents are expected to be excluded, <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-02/hr1185_2.pdf">according to the Congressional Budget Office</a>. A new proposal from Rep. Richie Neal, D-Mass., that is gaining steam in the House would tighten those standards even further, excluding as much as 42 percent of new mothers.</li>
    <li><strong>AMERICA’S DINER: </strong>In order to lure people to work in its restaurants, Denny’s is sending recruiters to travel across the country in a 53-foot food truck to recruit employees. The company is also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/customers-are-back-at-restaurants-and-bars-but-workers-have-moved-on-11626168601">offering free pancakes</a> and hiring bonuses to applicants at some of its stores. Of course, Denny’s is also a member of the National Restaurant Association, the lobbying group <a href="__GHOST_URL__/emanuel-headlines-event-for-group/">leading the fight</a> against a $15 minimum wage. Earlier this year, Denny’s executives <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mcdonalds-other-ceos-tell-investors-15-minimum-wage-wont-hurt-business-1580978">told investors</a> that a $15 minimum wage wouldn’t be bad for business, and might even help. Shareholders <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dennys-shareholders-revolt-after-ceo-concedes-15-minimum-wage-wont-hurt-business-1588970">responded by demanding</a> that Denny’s cancel its National Restaurant Association membership.</li>
    <li><strong>PENTAGON SEES "INCREASED POTENTIAL" FOR NUCLEAR CONFLICT:</strong> The Pentagon <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2021/07/increased-potential/">recently updated</a> its <a href="https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_72_2020.pdf">joint publication on nuclear operations</a> to warn of the increasing threat of nuclear conflict. “Despite concerted US efforts to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in international affairs and to negotiate reductions in the number of nuclear weapons, since 2010 no potential adversary has reduced either the role of nuclear weapons in its national security strategy or the number of nuclear weapons it fields. Rather, they have moved decidedly in the opposite direction,” the document, updated in April 2020, says. “As a result, there is an increased potential for regional conflicts involving nuclear-armed adversaries in several parts of the world and the potential for adversary nuclear escalation in crisis or conflict.”</li>
