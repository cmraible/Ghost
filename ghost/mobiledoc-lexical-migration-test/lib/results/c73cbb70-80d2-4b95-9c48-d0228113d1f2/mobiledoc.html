    <li><strong><a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20210225-0">Biden Follows Through On His Promise To Expand Unemployment</a></strong>(U.S. Department of Labor) — <em>The Labor Department issued a guidance Thursday stating that workers who turned down jobs at unsafe workplaces can qualify for unemployment, making good on the Biden administration’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-moves-to-reverse-one-of-trumps/">promise to undo</a> one of his predecessor’s worst labor directives. A Trump-era edict threatened to strip people’s jobless benefits if they turned down work for fear of being exposed to COVID-19. The rule forced many into hazardous jobs; since last March, upticks in workers’ safety complaints <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trump-reduced-enforcement-as-workers/">consistently preceded</a> spikes in COVID deaths. Now, most people who were denied unemployment for refusing to choose their job over their health can get benefits dating back to when they first applied.</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/democrats-target-private-equity-hedge-fund-tax-break-in-bill">Democrats’ Bill Would Close Tax Loophole For Private Equity</a></strong>(Bloomberg) — “<em>Three House Democrats are pushing legislation that would repeal the carried-interest tax break used by fund managers to reduce the levies they owe to the Internal Revenue Service. The bill would close the carried-interest tax break and require many hedge-fund and private-equity managers to pay higher ordinary income-tax rates, rather than the lower rates on capital gains.”</em></li>

While treasurer, Torsella “voted against high-fee contracts to Wall Street money managers recommended by the [state pension] funds’ staff and consultants, and called for more transparency in the funds’ often secretive proceedings,” the </em>Philadelphia Inquirer<em> reports.</em></li>

    <li><strong>Progressives Score More Gains In Michigan </strong>(The Daily Poster) — <em>Last week, </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-progressives-aim/">The Daily Poster</a><em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-progressives-aim/"> reported</a> that progressives in Michigan were trying to take over their state’s Democratic Party. The results of last Saturday’s election are in. According to Liano Sharon of the Michigan progressive group MI Solidarity, last week’s Saturday’s party elections were a rousing success. Sharon told </em>The Daily Poster<em> that progressives can now rely on “between 50 and 90” votes on the state’s 172-member central committee, a huge increase from the 40 to 60 votes that progressives could count on before the election. “I won't know for sure until we start taking votes,” Sharon said. “I know we have allies who won on the Unity Slate, some of whom are new to the [state’s leadership committee]. Could be as many as 90 on some issues, less on others.”</em></li>

At the hearing, the CEO of Costco announced that the company would be raising wages from $15 to $16 an hour next week.
