<p>“No one believes these loans are ever going to be repaid. The only question is who’s going to suffer and for how long before the political system assimilates that.” –– <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/student-loans-debt-payment-biden/">Marshall Steinbaum</a>, Jain Family Institute senior fellow on higher education finance, talking to <em>The Intercept</em> about student debt.</p>

<p>The American Rescue Plan sent $1,400 relief checks to most Americans, which started arriving in bank accounts over the weekend. But the bill <a href="https://prospect.org/first100/why-can-debt-collectors-take-your-1400-check-blame-everyone/">lacked</a> a key provision that was attached to the $600 checks in December’s relief package: a ban on private debt collectors seizing the checks.</p>
<p>Democrats are <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/543737-senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to-shield-stimulus-checks-from-debt">scrambling to pass</a> a bill preventing debt collectors from taking the checks, even though it may be too late to help people who have already had their payments seized. On Thursday, however, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-block-bill-stimulus-checks-debt-collectors_n_6053811ac5b638881d2a9e74">blocked the legislation</a>.</p>
<p>The financial industry has long been one of Toomey’s <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/pat-toomey/industries?cid=N00001489&amp;cycle=CAREER&amp;type=I">top sources</a> of campaign cash. During his career, he has raked in  more than $400,000 from donors affiliated with consumer finance and credit companies, according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F06&amp;cycle=All&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=Y">data</a> compiled by OpenSecrets. He also received <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F1410&amp;cycle=2020&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=Y">$9,000</a> from donors affiliated with student loan companies in 2019 and 2020, the second-highest total of any senator. Toomey was previously the <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/legislation-would-exempt-collection-attorneys-from-fdcpa">author</a> of legislation to exempt debt collection attorneys from rules aiming to protect people from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</p>
<p>Debt collection industry groups including ACA International, the industry’s largest lobbying group, <a href="https://www.acainternational.org/press/debt-collectors-set-the-record-straight-on-false-claims-regarding-stimulus-checks">have</a><a href="https://www.acainternational.org/news/covid-19-relief-bill-passes-house-representatives-stimulus-checks-senate-joe-biden-debt-collection-industry-aca-international-advocacy">been</a><a href="https://www.acainternational.org/news/aca-meets-with-cfpb-leadership-on-helping-consumers-manage-finances">insisting</a> that they do not support private debt collectors taking relief checks since last March, when the first COVID-19 stimulus bill was passed. Yet those same groups <a href="https://www.acainternational.org/assets/comments/aca-letter-to-hfsc.pdf">have</a> opposed attempts by Congress to attach protections against debt collectors accessing relief checks. ACA has been lobbying on stimulus legislation, according to <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/8c1d7554-e598-49e3-a028-8ab53df06ed3/print/">federal</a><a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/a8532876-dcdb-411c-a822-8802e99b6482/print/">records</a>.</p>
<p>ACA International’s political action committee <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/aca-international/C00034785/candidate-recipients/2016">donated</a> $5,000 to Toomey’s reelection campaign in 2016. In 2020, the PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/aca-international/C00034785/pac-to-pac/2020">donated</a> $30,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.</p>

<p><strong>• REPUBLICANS SUE FOR RIGHT TO CUT TAXES: </strong>Democratic Senators slipped a measure into the American Rescue Plan that prevents states and localities from using federal aid to subsidize tax cuts, as <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-big-win-against-anti-tax-zealotry/">reported</a> earlier this week. Now, Republican attorneys general are <a href="https://www.vox.com/22336588/ohio-1-9-trillion-stimulus-yellen-lawsuit-supreme-court-spending-clause-constitution-tax-mandate">lining up to sue</a> the federal government over the tax cut ban, arguing that it amounts to federal overreach. Meanwhile, GOP lawmakers are <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000178-421f-dd22-a17a-dfbf9e5c0000">calling on</a> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to issue prompt guidance on how the provision will be enforced.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN SEC TOSSES OUT WALMART PAID SICK LEAVE RESOLUTION: </strong>Last month, <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-companies-ask-regulators-to-help/">reported</a> that shareholders at major companies had filed resolutions for feasibility studies on paid sick leave, and those companies were asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to support them in refusing to bring the resolutions to shareholders for a vote. This week, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/shareholder-proposal-no-action-responses.htm">sided with</a> Walmart, giving the company its blessing to refuse a vote on the paid sick leave resolution.</p>
<p><strong>• TEACHERS UNION URGING REVIEW OF PRIVATE EQUITY PENSION INVESTMENTS: </strong>The American Federation of Teachers has published a <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/private-equity-report-2021.pdf">new report</a> assessing the performance of private equity in contrast to the industry’s promises, and calling on pension fund fiduciaries to review private equity investments. “This report makes clear that private equity performance as a whole has hardly been as impressive as the industry has claimed, and that it has worsened in recent years,” the report concludes.</p>
