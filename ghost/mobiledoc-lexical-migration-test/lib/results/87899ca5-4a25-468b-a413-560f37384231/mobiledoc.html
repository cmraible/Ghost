<p>“Amazon’s language conjures up images of robots filling up their batteries instead of human beings being allowed to rest in between demanding physical work. Time and time again, when given the choice between moving away from expecting its workers to perform at herculean levels or doubling down on methods that allow an extra bit of productivity to be squeezed out, Amazon chooses the latter.” –– <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqb43/amazons-new-amazen-program-will-show-warehouse-workers-meditation-videos"><em>Vice </em>reporting</a> on Amazon’s new <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005300/en/From-Body-Mechanics-to-Mindfulness-Amazon-Launches-Employee-Designed-Health-and-Safety-Program-called-WorkingWell-Across-U.S.-Operations">program</a> to reduce workplace injuries.</p>

<p>The American Action Network, a dark money group affiliated with House GOP leadership, received nearly half of the $47.7 million it raised between July 2019 and June 2020 from a single anonymous donor. The donor gave $23.5 million, according to the group’s most recent tax return, which was obtained by <em>The Daily Poster.</em></p>
<p>The American Action Network is currently spending <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/05/american-action-network-hits-house-dems/">millions of dollars</a> on a TV advertising campaign attacking a proposal by House Democrats to lower prescription drug prices. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), D.C.s top lobbying group for drugmakers, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/12/pharma-lobby-poured-millions-into-darkmoney-groups/">donated $4.5 million</a> to the organization in 2019.</p>

    <li><strong><strong>NORMALIZING VOTER SUPPRESSION: </strong></strong>A new poll finds that nearly half of Republican voters believe that, in advance of the 2022 midterms, GOP lawmakers should “push for changes to voting rules” so that Republicans “will win once those changes are in place.” The poll data reveals a stark reality: Voter suppression has become normalized not just among GOP leadership, but also among the party’s rank and file. Read <em>The Daily Poster’s </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-normalization-of-voter-suppression/">full dispatch</a> on the poll.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>STATE BATTLES CONTINUE ON HEALTH CARE REFORM: </strong></strong>The Koch brothers’s political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity (AFP) is <a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2021/05/14/despite-covid-kochs-americans-for-prosperity-continues-assault-on-medicaid/">continuing an aggressive campaign</a> against Medicaid expansion in Missouri, even after Missourians voted to expand Medicaid through a ballot measure last fall. As a result, Republican lawmakers in the state are refusing to fund the expansion. It looks an awful lot like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/after-joe-biden-broke-his-health-care-pledge-emboldened-lobbyists-are-targeting-states-1592216">efforts</a> from the Koch network and health insurance industry to kill public insurance option legislation in Colorado, Connecticut, and Nevada. The spending spree led to Colorado lawmakers watering down their state’s bill. At the federal level, Biden has failed to deliver on his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22422793/joe-biden-health-care-plan-obamacare-medicare-public-option">campaign promise</a> of introducing a nationwide public option and has also ignored other potential solutions such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22440101/missouri-medicaid-expansion-joe-biden">federalizing</a><a href="https://prospect.org/health/democrats-must-federalize-medicaid/">Medicaid</a>.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>DEFENSE RESTS IN DONZIGER CASE: </strong></strong>The <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/17/chevron-steven-donziger-trial/">trial of Steven Donziger</a>, the lawyer who took on Chevron over rainforest pollution in Ecuador and was then <a href="__GHOST_URL__/chevrons-prisoner/">charged and detained</a> for contempt of court, has come to its conclusion. Among the revelations of the trial: <a href="https://twitter.com/SDonziger/status/1393640522502131713?s=20">Private prosecutors in the case met with Chevron lawyers</a> before the trial, despite Chevron claiming it had nothing to do with the prosecution. Dongizer declined to testify as part of his defense, calling the trial a “charade.” A decision in the case is expected in the next two weeks, after the parties submit written closing arguments.</li>
    <li><strong>AMAZON’S SUSPICIOUS RELATIONSHIP TO THE POSTAL SERVICE</strong>: As the National Labor Relations Board continues hearings on Amazon’s potential interference in the union election at the Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, some of the most alarming revelations pertain to the company’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Econ_Marshall/status/1394432599464964098?s=20">relationship</a> with the U.S. Postal Service. Key details include: Amazon <a href="https://twitter.com/josheidelson/status/1393265201135296512?s=20">had a key</a> to the USPS dropbox where workers submitted their ballots, and <a href="https://twitter.com/josheidelson/status/1394432307088355328?s=20">may have had access</a> to outgoing mail. Emails also reveal that <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1394378731024572416?s=20">Amazon ordered the USPS</a> to place the illegal dropbox near the warehouse during the election.</li>

<p><em>Earther </em><a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/children-of-shell-employees-sure-seem-to-be-embarrassed-1846916959">reports</a> from this week’s annual meeting at Shell Oil:</p>
<p><em>At Shell’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, a company executive told a heartwarming story. Shortly before taking the role six years ago, the fossil fuel giant’s outgoing chairman, Charles Holliday, said he had a conversation with one of the company’s employees.</em></p>
<p><em>“I asked him the very simple question: ‘In three weeks I’ll become chair of the board of Shell. What would you like me to do,’” Holliday recounted in his opening remarks. “He looked me right back in the eyes and said, ‘my 13-year-old daughter is embarrassed to tell her friends at school that her dad works for Shell. I want you to fix that.’”</em></p>
