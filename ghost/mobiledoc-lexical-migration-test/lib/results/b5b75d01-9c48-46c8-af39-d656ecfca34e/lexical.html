<p>"There is virtually no path to getting Republican votes. It's too big, too expensive, and chalked full of tax increases that are nonstarters among Republicans.” - <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1377337997398401025?s=20">Brian Riedl</a> of the conservative Manhattan Institute on Biden’s infrastructure and tax plan, in a comment that offers yet another example of why the filibuster must be eliminated.</p>

<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>President Biden’s proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent is a moderate plan to keep the rate <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ib364-corporate-tax-rates-and-economic-growth/">below</a> what it has been for most of the last 70 years, but it may have profound consequences for one particularly predatory sector of Wall Street that has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/private-equity-inequality.html">pillaging the economy</a>: private equity.</p>
<p>After Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut legislation slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-driving-conversion-private-equities-123512360.html">private equity giants</a> such as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackstone-group-results/blackstone-to-switch-from-a-partnership-to-a-corporation-idUSKCN1RU196">Blackstone</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kkr-results/private-equity-firm-kkr-opts-to-become-c-corp-after-u-s-tax-reform-idUSKBN1I4164">KKR</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apollo-glo-mgmt-results/apollo-global-to-switch-from-a-partnership-to-a-corporation-idUSKCN1S812G">Apollo</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/07/31/term-sheet-wednesday-july-31/">The Carlyle Group</a><a href="https://www.internationaltaxreview.com/article/b1f7myb3mhxgl6/blackstone-restructures-as-corporation-after-tcja">converted</a> from partnerships into corporations, in order to take advantage of the lower rate. This new benefit was in addition to a longstanding <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102515/carried-interest-loophole-americas-tax-code.asp">private equity tax loophole</a>, which allows the Gordon Gekkos of the investment industry to pay a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html?">lower effective tax rate</a> than ordinary workers.</p>
<p>During the 2020 election, Blackstone’s billionaire CEO Stephen Schwarzman dumped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/push-to-defund-the-insurrection-targets/">$35 million</a> into Senate Republicans’ super PAC — and had the GOP’s campaigns been successful, there would be a near-zero chance of passing legislation to raise the corporate tax rate and force Blackstone to start paying its fair share.</p>
<p>“Schwarzman is trying to make sure that the Republicans at least hold onto the Senate in order to preserve the lower corporate tax rates that Blackstone is now relying on,” University of California-Irvine law professor <a href="__GHOST_URL__/billionaire-gop-donors-firm-reports/">told</a><em>The Daily Poster</em> at the time. “If the Democrats get a clean sweep and follow through on their promise to increase the corporate tax rate, that would create pain for firms like Blackstone that have locked themselves into paying those taxes.”</p>
<p>But Schwarzman’s election gambit failed, and now Blackstone — which has been accused of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/blackstone-kkr-hidden-hand-in-ad-blitz-unleashes-washington-fury">health care profiteering</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/08/27/amazon-rainforest-fire-blackstone/">fueling the climate crisis</a> — has started to freak out about the prospect of higher corporate tax rates.</p>
<p>“This administration may pursue tax policies seeking to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest and subject carried interest to more onerous taxation. The likelihood of such tax changes being implemented is increased given the Democrat controlled U.S. Congress,” the company said in its <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001393818/b0cf8c61-9359-4e96-a6b1-ee5feac433f9.pdf">annual report</a> to investors. “Increases in the corporate tax rate may adversely impact the cash flow of our portfolio companies and result in our funds selling those assets at values that are less than we projected, which would in turn have negative impact to the investment fund’s performance.”</p>
<p><a href="https://ir.kkr.com/sec-filings-annual-letters/sec-filings/?attchment=1&amp;secFilingId=f6f9d7c5-76bd-469d-944d-fc9cb4fb1492&amp;format=convpdf">KKR</a>, <a href="https://ir.carlyle.com/static-files/89f18cf4-d1ce-4fd5-ba5d-6fc58c7efa02">The Carlyle Group</a> and <a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/apollo/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=14727644&amp;Cik=0001411494&amp;Type=PDF&amp;hasPdf=1">Apollo</a> have also sounded similar alarms in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>These private equity giants cannot easily convert back to partnerships — they are likely stuck with whatever corporate tax rate Biden and Democrats legislate, and Biden’s separate proposal creating a <a href="https://itep.org/president-bidens-infrastructure-plan-moves-toward-ending-zero-tax-profitable-corporations/">minimum tax rate</a> could prevent them from zeroing out their tax bill with other sophisticated write-offs and evasions.</p>

<p>Labor unions are more popular, and big business less popular today than any year on record in the last 50 according to <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsojourner/status/1375443938396409861/photo/1">data from the American National Elections Surveys</a>.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>On Monday, during a virtual briefing about the recent spike of COVID-19 cases across the country, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky went “<a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1376558237332484099?s=20">off script</a>” to “reflect” on her feeling of “impending doom,” saying “I’m scared.” The same day, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/29/politics/biden-administration-trump-science-political-influence/index.html?utm_content=2021-03-29T18%3A15%3A04&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_source=twCNN">announced</a> that it was creating a task force to "prevent improper political interference" from affecting the science upon which it bases its policies.</p>
<p>However, for months, Walensky’s CDC and the Biden administration have been pushing to reopen schools nationwide despite calls for caution from epidemiologists and numerous <a href="__GHOST_URL__/americas-deadly-obsession-with-reopening/">studies from around the globe</a> indicating schools spread the virus.</p>
<p>In an interview last month, the CDC Director told Rachel Maddow that vaccines for teachers would not be a prerequisite for safe reopening.</p>
<p>“I think what that first hundred-day plan tells us is this is a priority, we have to get our children back to school,” she said.</p>
<p>Roughly a week later, the CDC released reopening guidelines that did not include teacher vaccinations. Earlier this month, the guidelines were updated, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0319-new-evidence-classroom-physical-distance.html#:~:text=CDC%20has%20updated%20its%20operational,moderate%2C%20substantial%2C%20or%20high.">reducing</a> the amount of social distancing required from 6 feet to 3.</p>
<p>In the last month, states like <a href="https://www.nbc26.com/news/local-news/dhs-investigates-584-active-covid-outbreaks-in-wisconsin-schools-27-in-brown-county">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/barnstable-public-schools-to-remain-in-remote-learning-for-week-of-march-29-2021/35960044#">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/carroll/news/cc-school-cases-20210310-syxpgfliezbu5aitifc5hnkpaa-story.html">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://people.com/health/new-jersey-school-district-suspends-vice-principal-after-covid-outbreak/">New Jersey</a>, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/03/296-infected-in-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-at-69-schools-says-michigans-march-29-school-outbreak-report.html">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/newsmd/coronavirus/6954294-5-Northland-schools-added-to-Minnesota-COVID-19-outbreak-list">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/upper-arlington-students-quarantined-coronavirus-in-person-learning-3-11-21">Ohio</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/100-coronavirus-cases-day-care-linked-uk-variant/story?id=76738410">Nebraska</a>, <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/colorado-school-restaurant-store-covid-outbreaks/73-7787b841-23f9-41db-aebc-c43e41367c9d">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.kenoshanews.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/some-west-virginia-schools-see-spike-in-virus-outbreaks/article_dcf4a43d-8568-5f8d-a98d-6ef165c00b0f.html">West Virginia</a>, and <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2021/03/28/radford-city-schools-students-to-return-earlier-than-expected-after-covid-19-spread/">Virginia</a> have experienced outbreaks in schools. Meanwhile, the Illinois Department of Health has cited K-12 schools as likely accounting for <a href="http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/location-exposure?regionID=0">21 percent</a> of cases.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TOXIC TAP WATER: </strong>An investigation by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/americas-tap-water-samples-forever-chemicals">Guardian and Consumer Reports</a> found "concerning levels of PFAS or arsenic" in 118 of 120 samples from community water systems across the U.S. “Almost every sample tested had measurable levels of PFAS, a group of compounds found in hundreds of household products,” the report found. “These chemicals are linked to learning delays in children, cancer, and other health problems.” The report additionally found “almost every sample had measurable amounts of lead.”</li>
    <li><strong>NEW YORK MUST VACCINATE PRISONERS, JUDGE RULES: </strong>A Bronx judge recently ruled that incarcerated people in New York’s prisons and jails had been <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1376651119556956160?s=20">arbitrarily excluded</a> from the state’s vaccination program and must be offered vaccines. The decision comes as COVID-19 had been spreading through the inmate population. Since last month, at least 1,100 inmates have tested positive and five have died.</li>
    <li><strong>ANTI-CORRUPTION BILL DIES IN VIRGINIA SENATE:</strong> The Virginia Senate <a href="https://readsludge.com/2021/03/29/virginia-senate-blocks-ban-on-personal-use-of-campaign-funds/">voted down</a> legislation to restrict the expenditure of campaign funds. The state has some of the loosest regulation of expenditures. Politicians can take unlimited sums from corporations and spend them on personal things that would be illegal in other states like expensive dinners.</li>
    <li><strong>CUOMO HAS A NINTH ACCUSER: </strong>Another woman has <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/03/29/woman-accuses-cuomo-of-kissing-her-against-her-wishes-in-2017-1370327">come forward</a> accusing the New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual misconduct, alleging that he kissed her without her consent in 2017, outside her home, while he was touring her town to survey flood damage. Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment and misconduct by at least eight other women, including current and former aides.</li>
    <li><strong>WASSERMAN WARNS OF FLORIDA GERRYMANDERING: </strong>Cook Political Report senior editor Dave Wasserman is <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1366836649896914956?s=20">warning</a> that Florida stands to gain two new congressional seats after the Census and that Republicans could draw them as safe red. Wasserman noted that the state’s high court has taken a sharp turn right, allowing the GOP to ignore the state’s fair districts requirements. The Democrats’ new election reform bill, H.R. 1, would <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/five-ways-hr-1-would-transform-redistricting">mandate</a> non-partisan redistricting by independent commissions, but there is no indication when and if it will pass.</li>
