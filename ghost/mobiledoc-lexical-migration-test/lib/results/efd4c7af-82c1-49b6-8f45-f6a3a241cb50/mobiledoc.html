<p>Good things are happening! Researchers have found that Indigenous resistance movements have stopped or delayed significant amounts of new greenhouse gas emissions over the past decade. A representative from Arizona gave an earful to the press about army generals going on TV to defend  the war in Afghanistan. And the labor movement is turning up the heat, again, on Senators who refuse to end the filibuster to pass the PRO Act.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>• <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2021/09/02/get-the-generals-off-tv-494199"><strong>Get The Generals Off TV</strong></a><strong></strong>(Politico) — <em>Ruben Gallego, a Democratic representative from Arizona and former Marine infantryman who served in Iraq, had some searing words for American generals appearing on cable news to criticize President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. “They conducted the war incorrectly... They hid real-time data from Congress and the American public about how weak the Afghan government was, and now they still come out as if their hands aren’t involved in the problems that they created,” he said.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/climate/federal-judge-trump-water-pollution.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes"><strong>Federal Judge Strikes Down Trump Rule Governing Water Pollution</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“A federal judge on Monday struck down a Trump-era environmental rule that drastically limited federal restrictions against pollution of millions of streams, wetlands and marshes across the country. The Biden administration had already begun the lengthy process of undoing the policy, which President Donald J. Trump established in 2020 after farmers, real estate developers and fossil fuel producers complained that Obama-era rules had saddled them with onerous regulatory burdens. Mr. Trump’s policy allowed the discharge of pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and industrial chemicals into smaller streams and wetlands.”</em></p>

<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://www.ienearth.org/indigenous-resistance-against-carbon/"><strong>Indigenous Resistance Stops Emissions </strong></a>(Indigenous Environmental Network and Oil Change International) — <em>“In this report, we demonstrate the tangible impact these Indigenous campaigns of resistance have had in the fight against fossil fuel expansion across what is currently called Canada and the United States of America. More specifically, we quantify the metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions that have either been stopped or delayed in the past decade due to the brave actions of Indigenous land defenders. Adding up the total, Indigenous resistance has stopped or delayed greenhouse gas pollution equivalent to at least one-quarter of annual U.S. and Canadian emissions.”</em></p>

<p>“Excellent writing in tone and substance. This event surely is a litmus test of whether Congressional Democrats and the President are but quasi manipulative self-serving empty shirts hung out to dry, or human beings with integrity-in-action demonstrating decisive guts and wisdom. The happier women are, the happier the culture is.” — Sholeh, commenting on “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-stalled-abortion-protections-in-a-committee/">Dems Stalled Abortion Protections In A Committee</a>”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Climate writer Mary Annaïse Heglar <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryHeglar/status/1433798065341747202?s=20">tweeted</a> some wise words this week for grappling with the scenes of climate destruction all around us: “Don’t worry about whether we’re doomed or not. Worry about what you stand for. And stand for it.”</p>
<p>Here’s one way to do that: The <a href="https://adsnotfittoprint.com/">#AdsNotFit2Print campaign</a> is a coalition of NGOs, grassroots organizations, and journalists asking <em>The New York Times</em> to stop publishing fossil fuel ads, and the group wants you to <a href="https://adsnotfittoprint.com/">sign their petition</a>.</p>
