<p>Good things are happening! Fossil fuel interests are facing mounting heat in Washington for spreading misinformation about global warming. Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has drawn a line in the sand on the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package, while Los Angeles makes a bold move to stop fossil fuel developments. What’s more, Americans are finally realizing the Supreme Court isn’t the beacon of apolitical justice that it purports to be.</p>

<h3 id="take-action">Take Action:</h3>
<p>We teamed up with The Intercept and The American Prospect to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/whip-count-the-democrats-who-support-the-progressive-reconciliation-strategy/">call every Democratic member of the House of Representatives</a> and ask if they supported keeping the reconciliation bill tied to the infrastructure bill, the only strategy that will ensure that bold climate, anti-poverty, and housing reform measures are implemented. Check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxiymDOhOOY_dmtRfxChgez-LTh6GKI6vJj2JIefzOI/edit?usp=sharing">whip count</a> and see if your representative is on board with the strategy. If not, give them a call and let them know you expect them to keep the bills together, and then email us at <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> and let us know what they say!</p>
