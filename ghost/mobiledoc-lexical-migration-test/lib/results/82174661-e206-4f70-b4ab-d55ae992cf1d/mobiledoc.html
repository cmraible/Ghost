<p>This week, <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> David Sirota <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTbE5iew8fs">talked</a> to Matt Taibbi and Katie Halper about the resurgence of non-corporate media — and why so much of the establishment press seems so freaked out about the success of independent news outlets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/media-trust-crisis-2bf0ec1c-00c0-4901-9069-e26b21c283a9.html">Polls</a> now show that the public’s trust in media has hit a new low, and that’s no surprise after the national press corps helped spread so much of the misinformation that led to so many disasters in the last few decades. Clearly, readers are looking for more independent and credible outlets that are willing to challenge power.</p>
<p>During the discussion, Sirota also discussed <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> recent reporting on congressional Democrats’ tax proposals, including one proposal to give hundreds of billions of dollars to the wealthiest 5 percent of the country.</p>
