<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/delaware-just-humiliated-its-democratic/"><strong>Delaware Just Humiliated Its Democratic Senators</strong></a></strong>(The Daily Poster)<strong> — “</strong><em>Less than two months after Delaware’s Democratic U.S. senators cast decisive votes to help Republicans kill a $15 minimum wage initiative, Democratic lawmakers in their own state just took a big step toward passing the same minimum wage legislation statewide. In the process, Delaware’ Democratic state lawmakers slammed the kind of corporate talking points that their own U.S. Senators used to justify their actions.”</em></p>

<h4 id="reader-comment-of-the-week"><strong>Reader Comment Of The Week:</strong></h4>
<p>“I thoroughly enjoyed tonight's Movie Club meeting — and the discussion. The state of our politics can be pretty depressing, and the film clearly shows why — in an extremely funny way.</p>
<p>One key item that there wasn't time to discuss was the fact that the main element driving Congressman Johnson's change was a "citizen activist" concerned about what high-power lines were doing to the young people. I still marvel at the beautiful twist of the story — a "crook" is honest enough to decide he's going to Washington for the money, and then decides he wants to do good for people. (It's always the other way around..)</p>
<p>Based on our experience with Covid-19 — and irrationality of so many millions of Americans — I wonder how much worse it's going to have to get before we start turning things around. (I think it's starting to turn around, just not fast enough to suit me.) Anyway, I wanted to thank you and your team again for a terrific evening.”</p>
