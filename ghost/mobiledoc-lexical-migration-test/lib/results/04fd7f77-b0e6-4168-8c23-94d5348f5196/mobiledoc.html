<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder that tonight at 8pm ET, we have our next <em>Daily Poster</em> live chat — this one with me, former Bernie 2020 co-chair Sen. Nina Turner and Bernie 2020 pollster Ben Tulchin. We’ll be looking at exactly what happened in the 2020 election. Turner will discuss her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/08/working-people-delivered-biden-win-nina-turner/">new Washington Post oped</a> and Tulchin will present new data spotlighting what drove the results of the national election.</p>
<p>Additionally, on Wednesday evening November 18th, <em>The Daily Poster</em> will be hosting a subscriber-only live chat with Sirota, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser about Republicans’ effort to try to steal the Electoral College results.</p>
<p><em>These are events exclusively for Daily Poster supporting subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcasts live and ask questions in real time.</em></p>
