<p>Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the key battleground states that could decide the presidential election. That is why — as a yesterday’s Daily Poster report detailed — Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been trying to change election laws in ways that critics say could suppress turnout and deter voters from going to the polls. Meanwhile, Republican operatives have reportedly been exploring ways to use the GOP’s control of the state legislature to shift Pennsylvania’s Electoral College electors to Trump.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro has been in court against the Trump campaign and against the U.S. Postal Service to try to protect voters’ rights. In an interview with <em>The Daily Poster</em>, he says that he believes Trump is actively trying “to make it harder for people to vote in our democracy” — and he discussed what his office is doing to try to fight back. He also talked about the state of the 2020 race, and what Democrats have to do to win back states like Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the discussion. You can <a href="/q-and-a-with-pennsylvania-attorney/">click here</a> to listen to the full audio of this interview.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you spearhead a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Postal Service?</strong></p>
<p>A: The president's handpicked crony for postmaster general made operational changes at the Postal Service that we proved slowed down the mail. We demonstrated that those operational changes were required to go through a regulatory process before they could be implemented. And he failed to do that, which made those changes illegal. And so we went to court to say, you've got to roll back [to] have the mail flow at its proper rate.</p>
<p>The good news is we were able to convince the judge that we were right. Louis DeJoy and President Trump were wrong. And now those changes are going to be rolled back. And in theory, the mail is going to start flowing on time.</p>
<p>These postal workers did nothing wrong. They're heroes, but they are being messed around with by the leadership at the top. Typically a postal worker would show up for his or her route, load up the truck, and leave. Once the truck is loaded up, you deliver all the mail and come back when the mail is done being delivered. DeJoy’s changes said you have to leave at a set time and come back at a set time, whether your truck is fully loaded or whether your truck has been emptied out. As a result of that, mail wasn't being delivered.</p>
<p>Because I don't believe anything Louis DeJoy or Donald Trump says, one of the things we sought from the judge is some kind of independent verification system to be able to show that the Postal Service actually rolled back these changes. Hopefully now we will get the president and his crony to stop screwing around with our mail, so that people can have faith and confidence in this important system.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should people be worried about putting their ballot in the mail? Should they instead drop their ballot in a drop box or go to a polling station on election day?</strong></p>
<p>A: I voted by mail in the primary. I wouldn't hesitate to vote by mail again. And here in Pennsylvania, we'll have about 6 million people vote in this election. And if the projections hold up based upon the number of people who have already requested mail-in ballots about 3 million will vote by mail. So roughly half of the electorate may vote by mail. And I think now that we've got the issue with the Postal Service squared away, I think it's even more reason for people to be confident in the mail.</p>
<p>But separately, we have attacks coming from the president to actually undermine the vote-by-mail system.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So you’re saying the postal delivery service itself should be trusted, but Trump is trying to harm the rules of the entire election system in Pennsylvania. What exactly is going on?</strong></p>
<p>A: So Donald Trump and his campaign and his enablers have actually sued us here in Pennsylvania to make it harder for people to vote by mail. Think about this: We have a sitting president of the United States of America suing to make it harder for people to vote in our democracy. He wants fewer people to vote. Why? Because two-thirds of the people who have requested ballots to vote by mail here in Pennsylvania are Democrats. He's trying to silence voices that he doesn't want to hear. So he has sued us and we went to court.</p>
<p>The central argument by Donald Trump and his enablers was that there's all kinds of fraud in Pennsylvania, so we can't trust the system. So I quite literally said, okay, Mr. President put up or shut up — demonstrate the fraud. And they demonstrated no fraud (and) the judge ultimately stayed that case (and) our state Supreme Court ruled that the vote-by-mail statute is constitutional.</p>
<p>Now we're continuing to face litigation from the president to try and make it harder for people to vote here in Pennsylvania, to try and create a system where Black and Brown communities can be unfairly targeted with out-of-county poll workers who would come in and try to make it harder for them to vote. I cannot stand for it. We're going to keep fighting back.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What specifically is the Trump campaign arguing in court and what would become harder if they are successful?</strong></p>
<p>A: So you might drop your ballot off in Colorado in a dropbox, and people do that all over the country including in our neighboring state of New Jersey. Well, Donald Trump is suing to try and get rid of dropboxes in Pennsylvania so that people can't drop their ballots off, which would confuse the process and make it harder.</p>
<p>Another example is we've had a long-standing law here in Pennsylvania that says, if you're going to be a poll worker or poll watcher, you have to be from that county. That's been the law for decades...That's the way the system has always worked.</p>
<p>Now, Donald Trump wants to change that through the courts to make it so people from out of county can come in and be a poll worker in a different county.</p>
<p>Now, one of your listeners might say, ”Well, I don't know. That sounds sort of benign. As long as they're from Pennsylvania, it's okay.” Yeah, until you're bringing in the Proud Boys from a different county to go stand in predominantly Black and Brown communities and make it harder for people to vote there. This is what Donald Trump is up to in this battleground state, and we are fighting back in court to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>Q: During the presidential debate, Trump suggested that <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/philadelphia/trump-debate-philadelphia-elections-history-20200930.html"><strong>bad things happen</strong></a> in Philadelphia. What did you interpret that to mean and what do you think he was trying to do by making a comment like that?</strong></p>
<p>A: The president lied, period. End of sentence, hard stop. He came after my home lying and whining about these bad things that are gonna happen in Philadelphia. Democracy happens in Philadelphia and it's that very democracy he's trying to undermine with his lies.</p>
<p>I'll nerd out on you for a minute here on the law. (Trump) claims that his poll watchers were denied access to an early voting center, right? That's what he said. And then from that, he said, bad things are happening in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Okay. First off, he has no poll watchers registered in the city of Philadelphia. Number two, our laws don't allow for poll watchers for any candidate or any party at an early voting center. Our laws only allow for poll watchers to be there on election day at polling sites as defined by the various county election offices.</p>
<p>So what he's doing is he's trying to create a narrative of chaos in our voting system, because he thinks that suits his political aim. But at the same time, what he's really doing is trying to undermine our democracy. Think about that for a second — we have a president of the United States who's trying to undermine our democracy, and that is not only shameful, it's wrong. And I'm fighting them in court over the various attempts to do that. I'm certainly not going to allow him to mess with my state or mess with the city of Philadelphia and lie about things.</p>
<p>I think we need to stop trying to figure out what Donald Trump means and just call him what he is. And that is a flat-out liar.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What can be done to prevent voter intimidation at polling places, but also preserve people’s freedom to speak out or protest? How can we strike that balance?</strong></p>
<p>A: It's the same debate we always have over a proper balance between free speech and inciting violence. There is a line that you can't cross— and understand that we're litigating right now in court. Trump's attempts to allow people from other counties to be poll watchers in different counties is designed to be able to bring people into places like Philadelphia and intimidate certain voters.</p>
<p>But I want to step back and make a broader point about the Proud Boys and white supremacist groups. You know, Donald Trump's own FBI director <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/06/joe-biden/fbi-director-warned-about-white-supremacist-violen/">said</a> (recently) that racially motivated violent extremists like white supremacists (have) been responsible for the most lethal attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>Go ask the people at Pittsburgh who saw what happened at the Tree of Life Synagogue about the dangers of white supremacists and these people spewing that kind of hate... It's a real problem and we need a president who's going to address this with some moral clarity, not give the Proud Boys a wink and a nod and tell them to be ready… We don't want to let them “stand by,” as the president said.</p>
<p>I can tell you that incidents of hate and the violence associated with that type of hate speech have been on the rise here in Pennsylvania and indeed across the country over the last four years. Whether it's directly due to the president making a racist statement or the president allowing his words to be misappropriated by hate groups like the Proud Boys and used as an excuse to incite violence in our communities — we can't allow that. And we're not going to here in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/"><strong>The Atlantic’s recent report</strong></a> suggested that there could be a situation in Pennsylvania in which Republicans who control the legislature end up using a close election result to appoint Trump electors to the electoral college, regardless of the outcome. Is that possible?</strong></p>
<p>A: Pennsylvania law is crystal clear that the General Assembly cannot ignore the popular vote and just choose their own presidential electors. The general assembly made that law. And so confusing voters with this type of misinformation is absurd. It's irresponsible. And by the way, don't take my word for it. The Republican leader of the Pennsylvania Senate, who was actually cited in that Atlantic article, debunked this nonsense as well.</p>
<p>So we're not going to allow any interference in our Pennsylvania election. Whichever candidate earns the most votes will have 100 percent of our Pennsylvania electors.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if there's a recount or there's a question of which way the election goes and then the state is up against the deadline to send the electors to the Electoral College. Is there any chance that there is a situation in which whatever happened in the election is still in question and the legislature essentially has to act?</strong></p>
<p>A: I don't see that scenario, but I will tell you that we are preparing for all kinds of scenarios — scenarios leading up to election day, scenarios on election day, and then scenarios after election day. So we are well-versed in the law and we're prepared for what may come.</p>
<p>Putting my political hat on for a moment, I'm confident Joe Biden wins this election by a margin much greater than what Donald Trump won by last time, which was 44,000 votes out of about 6 million cast. Nevertheless, we're prepared and we will follow the rule of law. And the rule of law makes clear that it's the popular will that will determine the electors, not legislators.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What role are Pennyslvania Republicans playing in all of this?</strong></p>
<p>I think there's a lot of responsible lawmakers in Harrisburg — Republicans and Democrats. And then there's a bunch of Republicans who just can't seem to suck up to Donald Trump enough, and they're his enablers. They're led by the chief enabler here in Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, who's just a spineless, pathetic creature.</p>
<p>They are constantly doing their part to suck up to Trump and to make it seem like they have his back... What is sort of laughable in the cynical environment we're in is that more Republicans voted to create vote-by-mail in Pennsylvania than Democrats did. They actually led the way on these (vote-by-mail) reforms and that was only a year and a half ago — literally in 2019.</p>
<p>Then as soon as Donald Trump starts tweeting stuff about them, they get scared and they backtrack. The hypocrisy is actually pretty shocking.</p>
<p>Again, there's some responsible folks who are trying to do the right thing. And then you've got some of these folks who follow Pat Toomey's lead and they just act as Donald Trump's enabler every single day. It's sad to watch, but I think at the end of the day, our democracy and our system of laws, both here in Pennsylvania and across the country is far stronger than Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Q: During the 2016 election, Chuck Schumer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/have-democrats-learned-their-lesson-theres-reason-for-hope/2017/11/07/cab3e78c-c315-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html"><strong>said</strong></a>: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” That didn’t happen. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016. Do you think Democrats have developed a new political outlook on how to win in states like Pennsylvania? Do you think the political environment has changed to make it harder for Trump to win Pennsylvania again in 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Well, look, on election night 2016, Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes, but I win Pennsylvania as a Democratic attorney general (candidate) by 200,000 votes. And it wasn't based on Chuck Schumer's theory of the case.</p>
<p>I didn't win because I got more votes in the Philadelphia suburbs. We did very well there, but I didn't run 250,000 votes ahead of Hillary Clinton in the Philadelphia suburbs. I made up those quarter million votes in communities that have often been forgotten by Democrats in places like Johnstown, Wilkes-Barre, Scranton and areas that the national Democrats have largely ignored.</p>
<p>(These are) communities where the pandemic is raging and economic inequality is laid bare day in and day out, particularly during coronavirus where consumers get screwed and corporations get richer off their backs. These are the communities that ironically put Donald Trump over the top, even though Donald Trump has consistently worked against their interests.</p>
<p>As we look to 2020, there are some different dynamics and there's some similar ones. Number one, I think our party needs to do a better job of communicating to those neighborhoods that have been forgotten. I know I'm working very hard there and I think nationally Democrats need to do that. Now, Joe Biden is from Scranton — he's from one of those towns. I think he gets it. But I think we need to focus on making sure that those sorts of economic issues — the inequality issues — are at the forefront of people's minds.</p>
<p>Now, interestingly enough, Chuck Schumer's theory of the case with suburbanites didn't play out in 2016 (but) it may actually play out in 2020, if you dive into the polling, you dive into what's happening on the ground.</p>
<p>I think the data backs up my gut on this, and that is the suburbs around Philadelphia, which are about 3 million people; the suburbs around Harrisburg, which is in sort of the south-central part of our state; and the suburbs around Pittsburgh, which is in the southwestern part of our state — those areas are trending much more toward Democratic candidates, and Joe Biden in particular. So I think you will see some gains there. I feel confident –– although I'm not taking my foot off the gas.</p>
