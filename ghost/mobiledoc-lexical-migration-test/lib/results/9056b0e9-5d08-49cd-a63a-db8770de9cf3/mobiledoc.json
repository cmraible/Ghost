Meanwhile, Republican operatives have reportedly been exploring ways to use the GOP’s control of the state legislature to shift Pennsylvania’s Electoral College electors to Trump."

And so confusing voters with this type of misinformation is absurd. It's irresponsible. And by the way, don't take my word for it. The Republican leader of the Pennsylvania Senate, who was actually cited in that Atlantic article, debunked this nonsense as well."

Do you think the political environment has changed to make it harder for Trump to win Pennsylvania again in 2020?"
