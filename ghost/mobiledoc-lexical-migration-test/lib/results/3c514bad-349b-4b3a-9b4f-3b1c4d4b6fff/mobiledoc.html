<p>In recent years, leadership of some of the nation’s largest unions have publicly opposed single-payer health care proposals, angering their rank-and-file and forcing Democratic politicians who back single-payer to take on a key constituency.</p>
<p>In New York City, for example, the umbrella organization for the city’s  public sector unions — the Municipal Labor Committee (MLC) — recently helped the health insurance industry <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-backroom-deal-to-kill-single-payer/">block a statewide single-payer bill</a>, on the grounds that their members wanted to keep the health care benefits for which they had sacrificed wage increases.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the MLC, which bargains for health care benefits for city unions, was also engaging in backdoor negotiations with the city, resulting in a proposal to switch nearly a quarter million people from Medicare to privately administered Medicare Advantage plans. </p>
<p>The move, scheduled to go into effect on July 1, would change the annual out-of-pocket costs of those impacted from a maximum of <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/4/21/22396708/retired-nyc-workers-medicare-advantage">$1,053</a> per year to up to <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2021-premiums-cost-sharing-out-of-pocket-limits-and-supplemental-benefits/">$7,550</a>. It could also force retirees to find new doctors, as many doctors don’t accept Medicare Advantage plans, and <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/prior-authorization-in-medicare-advantage-plans-how-often-is-it-used/">could require prior authorization</a> for procedures, which tends to lead to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-medicare/column-u-s-probe-shines-light-on-medicare-advantage-claims-denials-idUSKCN1MS2XG">high claim-denial</a> rates.</p>
