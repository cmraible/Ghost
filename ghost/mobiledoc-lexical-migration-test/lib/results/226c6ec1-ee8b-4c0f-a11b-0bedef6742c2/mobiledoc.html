<p>Friends:</p>
<p>In the last 48 hours, The Daily Poster has been <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1328772836857499648?s=20">attacked</a> by GOP operatives at the Lincoln Project, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-bidens-first-climate-appointment/">broken open</a> the story of Joe Biden appointing an oil ally, held a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tonight-live-chat-at-730pm-et-with-c47/">live event</a> with state attorneys general fighting the Trump administration, and published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tucker-carlson-and-media-elites-cozy/">major investigative report</a> showing the links between media elites and Wall Street moguls.</p>
<p>We are clearly having a major impact - and we are right now trying to hire more reporters to expand our newsroom to do more of this reporting in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>So here’s my ask — PLEASE <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>Look, I don’t like asking people to pitch in during such tough economic times, but here’s the thing you should understand: Because we are grassroots funded, the only way we can hire more journalists to do more accountability reporting is if free subscribers pitch in and become supporting subscribers. We aren’t owned by a giant corporation or a billionaire with endless resources - we rely on our readers to fund our journalism.</p>
<p>When you become a subscriber, you get some cool stuff - you get our subscriber-only content and you get to participate in all our exclusive live events — and we’re going to be expanding these subscriber-only offerings soon.</p>
<p><strong>If you like the stories we are reporting, <a href="#/portal/signup">please click here</a> to become a supporting subscriber today.</strong></p>
<p>We are building a whole new grassroots-funded model for accountability journalism that holds politicians accountable, regardless of their party. With your help, we can continue making a big impact.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
