<p>On Thursday 3/11 at 7pm ET (4pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will talk with New York State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and New York Assemblyman Ron Kim about the scandals encircling New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>Last Spring, while the national media was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cuomo-and-the-lincoln-project-are/">celebrating Cuomo</a>, <em>The Daily Poster </em>helped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">break open the story</a> of Cuomo passing a corporate immunity law for nursing home executives after receiving campaign donations from the corporate group pushing it. Recently, as revelations of the Cuomo administration undercounting nursing home deaths became major story, <em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/">found</a></em> that the immunity law has shielded administrators and executives from a wide range of negligence claims, even those that apparently directly related to COVID.</p>
<p>Last week, the New York Assembly <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/binghamton/politics/2021/03/05/state-assembly--senate-pile-up-bills-aimed-at-nursing-home-accountability">passed a bill</a> to repeal the immunity law, and the legislation is currently before the state senate. Still, the impact of the law <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/">could linger</a> for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Biaggi and Kim have been outspoken critics of the Cuomo administration's handling of nursing homes during the pandemic, and both have reportedly faced threats from the governor. Now, in the wake of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/nyregion/cuomo-charlotte-bennett-sexual-harassment.html">recent</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/nyregion/cuomo-harassment-anna-ruch.html">sexual</a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomo-toxic-workplace/2021/03/06/7f7c5b9c-7dd3-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html">harassment</a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/third-former-andrew-cuomo-aide-describes-inappropriate-workplace-treatment-11615081956?st=4fyt87sfzazafui&amp;reflink=article_gmail_share">claims</a> against Cuomo, both are among the growing number of lawmakers calling on the governor to resign.</p>
