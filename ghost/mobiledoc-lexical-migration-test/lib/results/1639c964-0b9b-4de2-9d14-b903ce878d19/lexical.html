<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Most of us right now are coping with multiple traumas — the trauma of the pandemic, the trauma of the economic crisis, the trauma of the imminent election and the trauma of all the anxiety over what might happen afterward.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve wondered why I’ve felt especially exhausted, and I think it is not just that we’ve been working as hard as possible to break big stories — but also because all of these worries are taking up more and more cognitive energy. It’s equivalent to malware running in the background of your computer, taking up more and more CPU power, making everything else on the machine run more slowly. My brain needs a reset, and it’s not going to get one for a while.</p>
<p>I don’t have any predictions about what will happen in the election — though I’m looking forward to hearing about some of the granular data from Bernie 2020 pollster Ben Tulchin during our first live chat tomorrow (Monday) at 5:45pm ET. I’m also looking forward to talking about the future with Naomi Klein at the same event. I’m hoping you’ll join us (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-election-eve-with-sirota-970/">details here</a>).</p>
<p>One thing I do know is that the isolation of the pandemic is making all the trauma worse. As I approach my 45th birthday tomorrow, I’ve been reading a book called <a href="http://www.barbarabradleyhagerty.com/life-reimagined">Life Reimagined</a> about the experience of midlife — and one of the major themes is how important social relationships are to our mental health, especially during times of stress, anxiety and trauma. Social distancing makes those relationships even harder to maintain — and I have no doubt that it is making the anxiety of this period that much more difficult for everyone.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful the live chat tomorrow gives us all a momentary dose of connection, and if it goes well, I hope such chats can be a more regular part of what we do here at <em>The Daily Poster</em>. We spend so much time working to break open big stories and dig out important facts that it’s easy to lose sight of how this project is also a way for us all to connect and engage.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the future of our country and our world — I look at my children and feel a sense of guilt and shame about what we are leaving them. Everywhere you look, greed, ignorance and hate are imperiling their generation’s future. But I know that so many people are fighting hard for something better — and they are fighting inside a rigged political system that forces us to choose only between immoral and imperfect choices.</p>
<p>We should all remember that Tuesday’s election is not going to singularly change everything. Indeed, if Trump wins (god forbid), we will all have to pick ourselves up and keep fighting. If Biden wins, we also have a very long and difficult slog ahead.</p>
<p>No matter the outcome, there will be moments of fear and despondence that we should accept and feel, because they are human. But we should resist allowing those feelings to become a rationalization for giving up. Our kids’ future is on the line, and so ultimately, failure is not an option.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
