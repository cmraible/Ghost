<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick note to remind you that if you’re looking for a good gift this holiday season, let me humbly suggest that you give your friends and family a gift subscription to <em>The Daily Poster</em>. It’s a great gift and it helps us hire more journalists!</p>
<p><strong>You can go to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gift"><strong>www.dailyposter.com/gift</strong></a> to give a gift subscription.</strong></p>
<p>I said this on the subscriber live chat on Wednesday: the way we’re going to keep building out this news outlet is by having our current subscribers tell all their friends and family about <em>The Daily Poster</em>. Giving a gift subscription does that, and so does you just encouraging folks you know to subscribe.</p>
<p><strong>You can always send the link <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>www.dailyposter.com/subscribe</strong></a> to anyone you know to encourage them to subscribe.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe, you get access to all of our subscriber-only content, our live chats and <strong>our new upcoming product that we’re launching this Tuesday that I think you’re going to love.</strong></p>
<p>One last thing: As a supporting subscriber, you are helping us build this news outlet from scratch — and so on this Thanksgiving holiday, I want to thank you for your support.</p>
<p>We truly couldn’t do this work without you — thank you for being part of the team.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
