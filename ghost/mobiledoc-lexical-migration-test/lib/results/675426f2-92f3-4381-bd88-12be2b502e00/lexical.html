<p><em>By David Sirota</em></p>
<p>Corporate CEOs want you to believe that they are fighting for democracy and equality, and the business press has often portrayed executives as the saviors of our society. But a terrific new essay examines why this is a fantasy – and why Democrats should avoid trying to link their political fortunes to the alleged benevolence of corporations. </p><!--members-only-->

<p>•&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/opinion/liberals-corporations-woke-capitalism.html"><strong>The Rise of ‘Woke Capital’ Is Nothing to Celebrate</strong></a> (New York Times) — "<em>The corporate defense of democracy is still <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/voting-rights-inspire-company-words-while-actions-fall-short" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>mostly talk</em></a></em>—<em> none of which means the occupants of America’s finest corner offices are misrepresenting their political views. I assume that, like their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/30/475794063/why-are-highly-educated-americans-getting-more-liberal" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>highly educated</em></a> and well-heeled peers, a good number of these titans of industry tend to lean blue and earnestly cultivate enlightened views. And yet that, too, is vaguely disconcerting. At a moment when Democrats are attempting to court the working class, publicly marrying their fortunes to those of capital is not only unsavory but unwise."</em></p>
<p>•&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theroot.com/we-found-the-textbooks-of-senators-who-oppose-the-1619-1846832317"><strong>We Found the Textbooks of Senators Who Oppose The 1619 Project</strong></a> (The Root) — <em>"When Mitch McConnell and 38 Republican senators sent a letter to the secretary of education decrying the ghastly prospect of white students having to learn actual facts about slavery, it was not unexpected. For centuries, this country’s schools have perpetuated a whitewashed version of history that either erases or reduces the story of Black America down to a B-plot in the American script. It’s why they hate Critical Race Theory, The 1619 Project and anything factual — because the white-centric interpretation of our national past is so commonly accepted, white people have convinced themselves that anything that varies from the Caucasian interpretation must be a lie."</em></p>
<p>•<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/07/worker-shortage-slavery-capitalism/"><strong> The Business Class Has Been Fearmongering About Worker Shortages For Centuries</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>"Business owners seem to mean that they can't find people who'll work for what the owners want to pay them. This is a 'shortage' in the same sense that there is a shortage of new Lamborghinis available for $1,000."</em></p>
<p>•&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/12/magazine/adam-mckay-interview.html"><strong>Adam McKay on How to Be Political and Entertaining and Not Destroy the World</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>"For all intents and purposes the Republican Party is no longer a functioning political party with actual policies and ideas. It’s motivated by pure power, reactionary beliefs. So I would say the real right wing in our country is the moderates; the right-wing version of me — maybe this isn’t the best example </em>—<em> is an Aaron Sorkin. You’ve got to remember, we just saw seven Democrats vote against raising a minimum wage that is $7.25 an hour. That’s extremely right-wing. Bill Clinton, the policies he pushed through are right-wing. The whole definition of right and left in our country is shattered because of this Republican Party that is almost a Ponzi scheme of meaning."</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://longreads.trust.org/item/Inside-Amazon-shadow-workforce-Mexico/"><strong>Inside Amazon's Shadow Workforce in Mexico</strong></a> (Thomson Reuters Foundation) — <em>"Interviews with workers, copies of pay slips, and WhatsApp messages from Amazon HR reveal that many had to work overtime beyond legal limits while others were let go without severance, forced to resign, or laid off after falling ill with COVID-19."</em></p>
<p> • <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously"><strong>How The Pentagon Started Taking UFOs Seriously</strong></a> (New Yorker) — <em>"Last summer, David Norquist, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, announced the formal existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force. The 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, signed this past December, stipulated that the government had a hundred and eighty days to gather and analyze data from disparate agencies. Its report is expected in June. In a recent interview with Fox News, John Ratcliffe, the former director of National Intelligence, emphasized that the issue was no longer to be taken lightly."</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://blowback.show/"><strong>Blowback</strong></a><strong></strong>— <em>"After a critically-acclaimed retelling of the Iraq War, season two of Blowback presents the unlikely story of the Cuban Revolution: America’s Cold War crusade brings the world to a nuclear-tipped showdown between the Kennedy brothers, Fidel Castro, the Soviet Union, the CIA, and the Mafia."</em></p>

<p>Friends:</p>
<p>On Friday night, I slept 11 hours — which was more than I had slept the entire previous week, because we were making final preparations to launch our new website and our expansion plan. As seamless as the transition (hopefully!) seemed to our subscribers, it took a ton of work behind the scenes. </p>
<p>Please know we are working as hard as we can to fix any minor bugs on the site, and to help you with tech support if you have any trouble with the site. You can always email us at <a href="mailto:support@dailyposter.com">support@dailyposter.com</a> if you have any issues.</p>
<p>For those wondering why we moved, it had everything to do with efficiency and growth. Our new platform here on Ghost gives us the kind of functionality to build out a full news site, rather than just a newsletter. This platform also significantly reduces fees, which allows us to invest more resources into journalism.</p>
<p>I have spent countless hours and many late nights staring at spreadsheets to try to make the numbers work for our expansion plan. We are aiming to hire more journalists, build out a podcast program and roll out video series — and all of it takes resources. So please know that your subscription is making all of this possible. </p>
<p>The more you can spread the word to your friends and encourage them to subscribe, the closer we get to being able to build out a full newsroom to hold politicians accountable. Whenever you get a <em>Daily Poster</em> story that you like, please forward it on to your friends, and send them this link to encourage them to subscribe: <a href="www.dailyposter.com/subscribe">https://www.dailyposter.com/subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our team — and being part of this effort to build a new, reader-supported model for independent journalism. The impact our reporting is making proves that the model can be successful — now we have to make sure we have the resources to build it out. It's going to take a lot of work — but I know that with your continued support, we can do it. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
