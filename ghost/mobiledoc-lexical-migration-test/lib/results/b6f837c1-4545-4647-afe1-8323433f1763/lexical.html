<p>All too often, those in power say one thing in public and something else behind closed doors. This week’s Weekend Reader is devoted to examples of journalism that aim to expose what’s being said and done when people think no one is watching. <em>The American Prospect</em> reports on how the Biden White House is quietly using access and flattery to keep progressives in line. <em>New York</em><em>Magazine </em>offers up a profile of a whistleblower willing to go to prison to expose the drone war the country’s military was keeping hidden away. And in <em>The Daily Poster</em>, we pull back the curtain on the crass internal documents government staffers are using to justify cutting off pandemic aid to millions of families during a historic deadly pandemic.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<h3 id="stuff-we%E2%80%99re-reading">Stuff We’re Reading:</h3>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/politics/how-joe-biden-defanged-the-left/"><strong>How Joe Biden Defanged The Left</strong></a> (The American Prospect) — <em>“While leaders of progressive D.C. groups have found themselves at the table at various engagements, events, shared press stunts, dinners with the vice president and at the White House, with a warmer reception than they ever got under Obama, it has not gotten their hands on the reins of the Biden agenda as it veers off course from its campaign-trail commitments. That, combined with the inchoate nature of calling out a president who just weeks ago was hailed as their vision of the next FDR, has translated into a kind of self-censorship. Groups have become unwilling to pressure the president, and subsequently unable to wield power.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/daniel-hale-drone-wars.html"><strong>Daniel Hale Exposed The Machinery Of America’s Clandestine Warfare. Why Did No One Seem To Care?</strong></a> (New York Magazine) — <em>Air Force intelligence analyst Daniel Hale was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/07/27/daniel-hale-drone-leak-sentencing/"><em>sentenced to 45 months</em></a> in prison this week for leaking records on the U.S. military’s drone program. As Hale said at his sentencing hearing, “I am here because I stole something that was never mine to take — precious human life. I couldn’t keep living in a world in which people pretend that things weren’t happening that were. Please, your honor, forgive me for taking papers instead of human lives.” In this piece, </em>New York Magazine profiles <em>Hale and his fight to expose the truth.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/africa/nigeria-fisherwomen-chevron.html"><strong>The Fisherwomen, Chevron And The Leaking Pipe</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“Oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Eni have made billions in profits in the vast Niger Delta region in the last decades. But now some are pulling out — and they are leaving utter ruin in their wake, according to government monitors and environmental and human rights organizations. The delicate ecosystem of the Niger Delta, once teeming with plant and animal life, is today one of the most polluted places on the planet. It is the women, who do most of the fishing in the creeks and marshes in this part of the Niger Delta, who are trying to call the oil companies to account.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://fair.org/home/manchins-coal-conflict-of-interest-not-of-interest-to-corporate-news/"><strong>Manchin’s Coal Conflict Of Interest Not Of Interest To Corporate News</strong></a> (Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting) — <em>“Manchin, who famously shot a bullet through a copy of Barack Obama’s cap-and-trade climate proposal in a 2010 campaign ad, is now the chair of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has starred in countless news stories about the infrastructure bills… As </em>Vox <em>(4/1/21) reported back when the infrastructure package was first shaping up: ‘Figuring out whether Biden will be able to make good on promises to decarbonize the economy necessarily involves an inquiry into the beliefs, motivations and intentions of one man: Manchin.’ The problem is, corporate reporters don’t seem so interested in Manchin’s “motivations.” If they were, they’d have to tell their audience that Manchin has a giant conflict of interest in the matter of fossil fuels.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/ban-private-beaches-public-property-parking-nationalize-federal"><strong>Ban Private Beaches</strong></a> (Jacobin) — <em>“A beautiful and relaxing experience like going to the beach shouldn’t be hoarded for the exclusive use of anyone who happens to have enough money to exclude everyone else. Private beaches should be nationalized — they belong to the people.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/moral-collapse-jd-vance/619428/"><strong>The Moral Collapse Of J. D. Vance</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“What should we call J. D. Vance, the self-described hillbilly turned Marine turned Ivy League law-school graduate turned venture capitalist turned Senate candidate? Words fail. His perfidy to his own people in Ohio is too big to allow him to escape with the label of ‘opportunist,’ and yet the shabbiness and absurdity of his Senate campaign is too small to brand him a defector or a heretic.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/at-alecs-annual-meeting-maga-hat-wearing-members-pursue-america-first-agenda/"><strong>At ALEC’s Annual Meeting, MAGA Hat-Wearing Members Pursue “America First Agenda”</strong></a> (Truthout) — <em>“The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is holding its first post-Trump in-person meeting this week in Salt Lake City, Utah at the five-star Grand America Hotel… Rewriting our nation’s founding document, protecting the interests of fossil fuels, fighting President Biden, regulating Big Tech, weakening unions, and undermining public education are all on the agenda.”</em></p>
<p><a href="http://citizencall.org/why-aid-cant-end-poverty/"><strong>Why Has Aid Failed To End Poverty In The Developing World, You Ask?</strong></a> (Citizen Call) — <em>Anthony Kalulu, founder of <a href="http://www.ugandafarm.org/"><em>Uganda Community Farm</em></a> in eastern Uganda, writes about why aid efforts have so often failed in the Global South: “By strictly fighting global poverty in a very remote way, i.e., by channeling all global antipoverty funding through the biggest, western-based global anti-poverty agencies, the challenge is twofold: a) these agencies can’t practically be present in every impoverished village across the global south all at once, and b) the little work that these agencies can do only happens in a few random villages, and is almost always guaranteed to be short-lived.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster">A Message From The Daily Poster:</h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It used to be that the halls of power were seen as places of grand gestures. In movies and TV shows, the politicians who roamed these halls were either bold do-gooders (<em>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>), or cartoonishly corrupt villains (<em>Three Days of the Condor, House of Cards).</em></p>
<p>Now, however, many have realized the truth: the halls of power are just like any other workplace: places brimming with mindless bureaucracy, where workdays are filled with random memos and pointless staff meetings. The only difference is that in the world of politicians, what hangs in the balance isn’t how many space sprockets are manufactured or whether all the TPS reports have cover sheets, but instead the fate of policies that impact thousands or millions of people.</p>
<p>The drudgery of modern politics can generate satire, as demonstrated by shows like <em>Veep</em> and <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. But it can also be horrifically demoralizing, especially when the curtain is pulled back on the thoughtless number crunching and paper pushing that is so often used to ruin people’s lives.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em>’s Andrew Perez did that this week by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-pros-and-cons-of-taking-money-from-your-constituents/">uncovering the internal documents</a> Republican officials used in North Dakota to plan cutting off pandemic unemployment benefits to thousands of their state’s citizens. To justify ending the federal benefits, government staff noted, “Employers and a large portion of the citizen base do not believe the programs should continue,” but then added as a caveat: “No official survey completed, so somewhat anecdotal.”</p>
<p>Almost as an aside, the staff noted that the jobless aid they planned to axe “provides [a] safety net to almost all ND citizens.” But really, who cares about that when there is “somewhat anecdotal” evidence that folks don’t think those programs should continue?</p>
<p>The situation could almost be the plot of a sitcom — if the consequences weren’t so tragically unfunny.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Andrew’s story is just one example of how we’re working every day to expose the wrongdoings of those in power — both the grand gestures and the routine decisions so often ignored. Thank you, as always, for helping us do this work, and keep an eye out for more of these important stories in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
