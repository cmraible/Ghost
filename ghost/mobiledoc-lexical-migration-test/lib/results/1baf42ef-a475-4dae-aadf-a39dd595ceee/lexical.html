<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I’m one of those people who has trouble figuring out what’s a good holiday gift — and it’s especially difficult during the pandemic, when you shouldn’t be out doing a lot of shopping. So we’ve got two solutions for <em>Daily Poster</em> supporting subscribers that help with gifts, and also will help us hire more journalists:</p>
<p><strong>1. A SPECIAL GIFT DEAL: </strong>Right now, if you <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gift">click here to give a gift subscription</a> to someone, <strong>we will give you an <em>additional</em> free gift subscription for someone else</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Give a gift subscription</a></p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Once you click here buy the gift for one person, just email <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> with an <em>additional</em> email address of another person who you’d like to also give a gift to. So basically, for every gift subscription you give, you get another one free. You can do this for as many gifts as you’d like to give!</p>
<p><strong>2. SEND SOMEONE A BIG DISCOUNT: </strong>Another thing you can do as a gift is to send someone a special holiday discount off a subscription to <em>The Daily Poster</em>. This discount is only for existing supporting subscribers to send to their friends and family. Just send them this special link for a 50 percent off discount, which gives them access to all of our live events and subscriber-only content:</p>

<p>Please consider taking advantage of these two offers. We are making them available only to our supporting subscribers as a thank you to you for being part of the team. We are also relying on our supporting subscribers to help us spread the word about what we are doing — and to help us build an even bigger subscriber base to support accountability journalism.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the team!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
