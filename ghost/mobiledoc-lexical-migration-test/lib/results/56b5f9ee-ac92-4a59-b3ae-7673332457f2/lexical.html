<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We launched <em>The Daily Poster</em> to create a reader-supported answer to the corporate media machine that spreads misinformation and defends the powerful. This week proved the success of what we’re doing — but we need your help to keep doing it. We need you to <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0#/">use this discount</a> to become a subscriber and join our team - <strong>and we wouldn't ask if if it wasn't really important</strong>.</p>

<p>I know everyone is busy and pressed for time, but please - take a moment to read this email about why you should use that discount right now.</p>
<p>The traditional journalism world is being taken over by Wall Street, which means independent journalism that holds BOTH parties accountable is more necessary than ever. Becoming a <em>Daily Poster</em> subscriber <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0#/">right now</a> will help us hire more journalists to hold politicians and corporations accountable — and you get all our podcasts, live events and exclusive content. And when you subscribe, we want you to email us at <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> to tell us what YOU want to see covered.</p>
<p><strong>Take a look at our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/"><strong>website</strong></a> right now to see everything we are doing. Then remember: If everyone who gets this email becomes a subscriber, we can build an entire newsroom that holds politicians and corporations accountable every single day.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the kind of accountability journalism that is becoming increasingly rare. Recenlty, a hedge fund called Alden took control of one of the largest newspaper chains in America. Alden is a soulless vulture capitalist fund that only cares about squeezing as much profit as it can from news outlets. In a six-year period, Alden cut staff at many of its papers by 75 percent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/21/998730863/vulture-fund-alden-global-known-for-slashing-newsrooms-buys-tribune-papers">NPR</a> explained the ramifications of this, noting that “Alden's cost-cutting measures made it much harder for journalists to expend the time and resources needed to hold public officials, corporations and other major players accountable through solid reporting.”</p>
<p>That’s the bad news. Here’s the good news: We are working harder than ever to ensure major players are still being held accountable — and you can see our work’s impact.</p>

<p>Since Monday, our team has broken <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">11 huge scoops</a>. We uncovered how Lyft and Uber’s political connections are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-blue-state-campaign-to-crush-gig-workers/">hurting gig workers</a>, how big businesses are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporations-kept-bankrolling-the-campaign-against-voting-rights/">funding anti-voting rights efforts</a> despite promises not to, and how the pharma billionaires want to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/opioid-billionaire-demand-sweeping-immunity/">shield their empire</a> from punishment for the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>Most fittingly, we exposed how Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now using his ownership of <em>The Washington Post </em> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bezos-weaponizes-the-washington-post-homepage/">whitewash</a> his corporation's shady employment practices. That’s the sort of story corporate media wouldn’t cover.</p>
<p>We are proving that journalism isn’t something to be squeezed dry by vulture capitalists, that take-no-prisoners investigative reporting has a future. But we have only been able to do so because free subscribers decided that our work was worth supporting.</p>
