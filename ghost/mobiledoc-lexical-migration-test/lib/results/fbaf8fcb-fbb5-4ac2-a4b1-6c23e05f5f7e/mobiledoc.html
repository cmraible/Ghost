<p>Amazon’s purchase of MGM Studios — it’s second-largest acquisition ever — might prove to be a step too far for lawmakers of both parties who are concerned about corporate consolidation in the media business. As a new report notes, the industry has experienced more than $700 billion worth of media mergers and acquisitions since 2014 — and there could be more consolidations on the way.</p><!--members-only-->

    <li><a href="https://time.com/6052162/amazon-mgm-sale/"><strong>Why Amazon’s MGM Purchase Could Put the Company in Washington’s Crosshairs</strong></a> (Time) — <em>“In recent years, major companies in various sectors have drawn a critical eye from leaders who worry their power has grown unchecked in the absence of substantive revisions to antitrust laws in the last 100 years, resulting in a concentration of market power in the hands of just a few large corporations. The number of companies dominating the media and entertainment landscape, for example, decreased from roughly 50 in 1983 to less than a dozen by the late 1990s, according to researcher B. Rajesh Kumar. This trend has continued in recent years, resulting in more than $700 billion worth of media mergers and acquisitions since 2014, according to a </em><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/media-mergers-and-acquisitions.html"><em>Deloitte report</em></a><em>."</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://capitalandmain.com/why-cant-we-make-this-work"><strong>How State Policies Hurt Workers And Worsen Income Inequality</strong></a> (Capital &amp; Main) — <em>“The Sheades’ struggles are emblematic of the larger income inequality crisis playing out across the country. Many working-class and middle-class Americans have seen their buying power fall and insecurity increase as wages stagnate and even decline in recent decades while the cost of living — especially housing — keeps spiraling upward. This crisis has been exacerbated in a historically conservative state like Arizona by cuts to funding for public education, as well as by reduced enforcement of labor standards, which has caused more pain for those Arizonans already struggling.”</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/democrats-voting-rights-filibuster/618964/"><strong>If Democracy Is Dying, Why Are Democrats So Complacent?</strong></a></strong>(The Atlantic) — <em>“If you’ve followed recent Democratic messaging, you’ll have heard that American democracy is under serious attack by the Republican Party, representing an existential threat to the country. If you’ve followed Democratic lawmaking, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the threat is actually a rather piddling one. The disconnect, in this case, isn’t attributable to Democratic embellishment, but to inexcusable complacency.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://prospect.org/politics/investigating-oversight-why-congressional-hearings-are-bad/"><strong>Investigating Oversight</strong></a> (American Prospect) — <em>“Congress doing its own investigating on anything is novel these days. A combination of understaffing, stretched responsibilities, lack of coordination, and a pervasive inattention to the importance of oversight has crippled a core function of the legislative branch. Beyond that, few members have a coherent philosophy about the purpose of congressional hearings and oversight, so much so that when one of them offers a respectable response, it’s bracing.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/are-us-officials-under-silent-attack"><strong>Are U.S. Officials Under Silent Attack?</strong></a> (New Yorker) — <em>“Top officials in both the Trump and the Biden Administrations privately suspect that Russia is responsible for the Havana Syndrome. Their working hypothesis is that agents of the G.R.U., the Russian military’s intelligence service, have been aiming microwave-radiation devices at U.S. officials to collect intelligence from their computers and cell phones, and that these devices can cause serious harm to the people they target. Yet during the past four years U.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to find any evidence to back up this theory, let alone sufficient proof to publicly accuse Russia.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/why-did-you-throw-stones/"><strong>Why Did You Throw Stones?</strong></a> (n+1) — <em>“Whatever the correct descriptor might be, the military occupation of the West Bank is hard to understand until you see it. You might be surprised at your own intolerance of the idea of a democracy maintaining an open-air prison for 2.7 million people. Before going there myself, I had heard this phrase, </em>open-air prison<em>, and figured it was not literally a prison. (As someone who spends a fair amount of time in prisons, I’m sensitive to its use as a metaphor.) But everywhere I went I saw guard towers and concrete barriers and razor wire — truly an open-air prison — except where there were settlements, which featured posh, Beverly Hills–style landscaping: little blooming flowers, fragile and bright, the guard towers in the far distance.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacre.html"><strong>What Tulsa Race Massacre Destroyed</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>This is a powerful multimedia examination of a dark moment in U.S. history that has been ignored for far too long. As the </em>Times <em>notes in the piece, “The destruction of property is only one piece of the financial devastation that the massacre wrought. Much bigger is a sobering kind of inheritance: the incalculable and enduring loss of what could have been, and the generational wealth that might have shaped and secured the fortunes of Black children and grandchildren.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-mans-amazing-journey-to-the-center-of-the-bowling-ball/"><strong>One Man’s Amazing Journey to the Center of the Bowling Ball</strong></a> (WIRED) — <em>One of the things I missed the most over the past year has been my regular weekly bowling league. This colorful longform story, about how science and one man’s persistence has revolutionized the sport, helped scratch that itch for me.</em></li>

<h3 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A Message From Sirota:</strong></h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We launched <em>The Daily Poster</em> to create a reader-supported answer to the corporate media machine that spreads misinformation and defends the powerful. The past few days have proven our work is more important than ever.</p>
<p>This week, a hedge fund called Alden took control of one of the largest newspaper chains in America. Alden is a soulless vulture capitalist fund that only cares about squeezing as much profit as it can from news outlets. In a six-year period, Alden cut staff at many of its papers by 75 percent.</p>
<p>News explained the ramifications of this decimation to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/21/998730863/vulture-fund-alden-global-known-for-slashing-newsrooms-buys-tribune-papers">NPR</a>: “Alden's cost-cutting measures made it much harder for journalists to expend the time and resources needed to hold public officials, corporations and other major players accountable through solid reporting.”</p>
<p>That’s the bad news. Here’s the good news: We are working harder than ever to ensure major players are still being held accountable — and you can see our work’s impact.</p>
<p>As you saw above, since Monday, our team has broken <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">11 huge scoops</a>. We uncovered how Lyft and Uber’s political connections are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-blue-state-campaign-to-crush-gig-workers/">hurting gig workers</a>, how big businesses are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporations-kept-bankrolling-the-campaign-against-voting-rights/">funding anti-voting rights efforts</a> despite promises not to, and how the pharma billionaires want to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/opioid-billionaire-demand-sweeping-immunity/">shield their empire</a> from punishment for the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>Most fittingly, we exposed how Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now using his ownership of <em>The Washington Post </em> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bezos-weaponizes-the-washington-post-homepage/">whitewash</a> his corporation's shady employment practices. That’s the sort of story corporate media wouldn’t cover.</p>
<p>We are proving that journalism isn’t something to be squeezed dry by vulture capitalists, that take-no-prisoners investigative reporting has a future. We have only been able to do so because all of you made the decision that this work is worth supporting.</p>
<p>You are helping us prove the media doesn’t need Wall Street hedge funds or tech titans to hold the powerful accountable.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping us build a new kind of news out. Thanks to you, the future of journalism looks brighter than it has in a long time.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
