Workers were told that their bid for collective bargaining could lead to cuts to pay and benefits; that they could be dragged before kangaroo courts and fined heavily for breaking union rules; that at a company like No Evil Foods, they would usher in a culture starkly at odds with progressive values and social justice. Most of all, employees were told that the union would upend a successful startup business, and get in the way of the team spirit and mutual trust that made No Evil Foods great.”"

Others understood it as a strategy to demand the impossible and, in doing so, to increase the chances of winning a straightforward budgetary demand for the state to spend billions of dollars to pay accumulated back rent. For Housing Justice for All, it was not an impossible demand, but a call — taken up in legislation at both the federal and state levels — for a fundamental reorientation of housing subsidy programs towards a framework in which the state’s role is not primarily to guarantee landlords’ revenue streams, but to keep people in their homes.”"

But as long as we retain our marbles, our quality of work as a writer, lawyer, executive, or entrepreneur should remain high up to the very end, right? Many people think so. I recently met a man a bit older than I am who told me he planned to ‘push it until the wheels came off.’ In effect, he planned to stay at the very top of his game by any means necessary, and then keel over. But the odds are he won’t be able to. The data are shockingly clear that for most people, in most fields, decline starts earlier than almost anyone thinks.”"
