On the other hand, most Texas power generators actually have a disincentive to make expensive modifications to prepare for a once-in-a-blue-moon winter storm. ‘Winterizing is a significant cost. Moreover, if you make energy a scarcity, then you can charge more,’ Krishnamoorti said. ‘It’s a very cynical way of looking at it, but in the end, it is a marketplace.’”"

Though his poll numbers have yet to significantly decline, the prestige media that spent so long propping him up has now turned. Even if Cuomo never sinks low enough to lose reelection next year — given his enormous war chest and New York’s horrific campaign finance laws, it’s still an unlikely scenario — he will never again be the governor feted by Ellen and celebrated by self-described “Cuomosexuals.” He’s not getting another Emmy. His moment is over.”"

It was as if they were somehow more confidential than a town paving contract or a sanitation worker’s salary. He found out that these financial managers were actually collecting much more than the systems had disclosed. He learned that the funds’ staff traveled the globe to keep track of investments, with their airfare and hotels booked by the money managers — and very little of that was public, too. In sum, Torsella said, he found that the pension plans, especially the teachers’ fund, treated Wall Street as a close partner rather than as a hired servant.”"

The new congressional Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn and Lauren Boebert take after Trump in their thirst and strident idiocy, but mostly in their understanding that their jobs are to sell, and complain, and post and post and post, and never to disclaim any of the lazy suspicions and secondhand gripes and idle vendettas out of which they’ve fashioned their public selves. As with Trump, the goal is in one sense more about presence than power; as also with Trump, and with Schilling, the obligation to that thirst runs far deeper than the ridiculous outward presentation would suggest.”"
