That is the subject of many of the stories we explore in this week’s Weekend Reader. One article reveals how rare-metal interests are rushing to mine the deepest parts of the ocean, with little regard to the disastrous consequences for a part of the world we know very little about. Another story details how a tiny activist investment firm had the guts to stand up to a fossil fuel giant, and ended up securing a major victory. And an illuminating profile depicts West Virginia Democratic Joe Manchin as “a man standing athwart history, not quite yelling ‘Stop,’ but certainly yelling ‘Whoa.’”",

But of the dozen journalists I spoke with for this story, most of whom declined to be identified out of concern for professional repercussions, all recalled times Amazon’s press team had engaged in manipulative and sometimes deceitful behavior. According to these writers and editors, and my own experience reporting on the company, Amazon’s comms team readily employs these rarer, bare-knuckle PR tactics. The ultimate result isn’t just that reporters have a harder time writing stories. Some may be deterred from writing on the company at all.
