Likewise, perpetuating stereotypes of irresponsible, money-grubbing Indians — hinting that if they were left in charge, they would likely destroy the land — is an assault on human dignity with deep roots in racism. This is how settler-colonialism works. In the process, it makes accomplices of citizens and unites non-Indigenous people in a common goal.”"

But for many Indigenous people in Canada and the United States, the nightmare was never forgotten. Instead the discoveries are a reminder of how many living Native Americans were products of an experiment in forcibly removing children from their families and culture. Many of them are still struggling to make sense of who they were and who they are.”"
