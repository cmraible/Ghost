<p>All too often, important stories get buried or lost, and it’s not simply because of wrongdoing. Exposing hidden truths is exceedingly difficult — the work takes time, money, courage, and more often than not, a good deal of personal fortitude. In this Weekend Reader, we’re highlighting coverage that went the extra mile to tell important stories nearly lost in all the noise. A reporter spent years uncovering the secrets behind one of the most horrific murders of the civil rights movement. A podcaster trekked all over the world to shed light on a shadowy figure wasting away in Guantánamo. And at <em>The Daily Poster</em>, we used carefully targeted record requests to expose the lies of state leaders cutting off pandemic-related jobless aid to struggling families all over the country.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/barn-emmett-till-murder/619493/"><strong>His Name Was Emmett Till</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“Our eyes adjusted to the darkness of the barn where Emmett Till was tortured by a group of grown men. Christmas decorations leaned against one wall. Within reach sat a lawn mower and a Johnson 9.9-horsepower outboard motor. Dirt covered the spot where Till was beaten, and where investigators believe he was killed. Andrews thinks he was strung from the ceiling, to make the beating easier. The truth is, nobody knows exactly what happened in the barn, and any evidence is long gone. Andrews pointed to the central rafter. ‘That right there is where he was hung at.’”</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/07/24/business/insult-injury-working-an-amazon-warehouse-is-dangerous-its-also-first-many-problems-facing-injured-workers/">Working At An Amazon Warehouse Is A Tough Job. It’s The First Of Many Problems Facing Injured Workers</a></strong>(The Boston Globe) — The Daily Poster<em>’s own Julia Rock partnered with Harry August at the </em>Globe<em> to expose how after workers were injured at an Amazon warehouse in Fall River, Massachusetts —one of the most injury-plagued Amazon facilities in the country — management gave them the runaround on workers compensation and benefits. The treatment forced many out of their jobs. As one former employee put it, “When we get hurt, we are no good to them.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/07/biden-big-left-gamble.html"><strong>Biden’s Big Left Gamble</strong></a><strong></strong>(New York Magazine) — <em>“Here we are, with a federal-budget proposal representing the highest sustained government spending since World War II being negotiated in the Senate and historic investments in a care economy and climate policy on the table via an imperiled reconciliation bill. It’s stuff that — if any of it works — would be the result of decades of organizing: on the streets, in electoral politics, and in the field of economic policy. If it doesn’t, human beings and the planet will be that much further from getting anything close to what they so desperately need. But success or failure now is also about whether this president will truly take advantage of that once-in-a-lifetime shift in economic thinking to produce lasting change, or just a marginally better version of an old Democratic model.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/16/texas-abbott-border-wall-trump/"><strong>Can Greg Abbott actually build Trump's border wall?</strong></a> (The Texas Tribune) — <em>“Ultimately, Trump’s administration erected about 80 miles of new barrier before he left office, including 21 at the Texas-Mexico border, paid for by the U.S. government. Now, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Trump supporter who has raised his rhetoric on immigration in recent years, has taken on the tall order of building a wall along the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/tribal-affairs-conservation-provides-a-cover-for-anti-indigenous-sentiments-stolen-land"><strong>When Conservation Provides A Cover For Anti-Indigenous Sentiments</strong></a> (High Country News) — <em>“To deny the established facts of land theft and genocide is to engage in something like Holocaust denial. Likewise, perpetuating stereotypes of irresponsible, money-grubbing Indians — hinting that if they were left in charge, they would likely destroy the land — is an assault on human dignity with deep roots in racism. This is how settler-colonialism works. In the process, it makes accomplices of citizens and unites non-Indigenous people in a common goal.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/us/us-canada-indigenous-boarding-residential-schools.html"><strong>Lost Lives, Lost Culture: The Forgotten History of Indigenous Boarding Schools</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“The recent discoveries of unmarked graves at government-run schools for Indigenous children in Canada — 215 graves in British Columbia, 750 more in Saskatchewan — surfaced like a long-forgotten nightmare. But for many Indigenous people in Canada and the United States, the nightmare was never forgotten. Instead the discoveries are a reminder of how many living Native Americans were products of an experiment in forcibly removing children from their families and culture. Many of them are still struggling to make sense of who they were and who they are.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/19/billionaires-space-tourism-environment-emissions"><strong>How The Billionaire Space Race Could Be One Giant Leap For Pollution</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“‘For one long-haul plane flight it’s one to three tons of carbon dioxide [per passenger],’ says Marais. For one rocket launch 200-300 tonnes of carbon dioxide are split between 4 or so passengers, according to Marais. ‘So it doesn’t need to grow that much more to compete with other sources.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.uncovered.health/features/how-insurers-obscure-healthcare-costs/"><strong>How Insurers Obscure Healthcare Costs</strong></a> (Un-covered) — <em>“As any magician will tell you, you can obscure what you don’t want people to notice by using a technique they’ve used forever: misdirection. Insurers want you to look at the fingers pointing away from them, not at the ones picking your pocket. An important goal of the industry’s misdirection is to keep customers and other important people from asking a question you’d think would be obvious: If insurers can’t do much about those ‘key drivers’ other than to point them out and complain about them, what, exactly, is the industry’s ‘value proposition’?”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.capitaldaily.ca/news/penniless-two-decades-without-money"><strong>Penniless: Why A Victoria Man Has Gone Two Decades Without Money</strong></a><strong></strong>(Capital Daily) — <em>“What if instead of always trying to figure out how to get more money, you could figure out how not to need it? What if it were possible to sever your dependence on it? To banish it completely from your life? For most of us, such questions would remain a thought experiment absent a major reorganization of civilization and the global economy. But, motivated by reasons more pure than stress relief, Johnston ditched money almost two decades ago, and he says there’s no going back.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/809233558/the-other-latif"><strong>The Other Latif</strong></a><strong></strong>(NPR) — <em>Last year, radio reporter Latif Nasser produced this six-part </em>Radiolab <em>podcast series detailing the story of Abdul Latif Nasser, a detainee at Guantánamo with whom Nasser shared a name. According to the sprawling series, Nasser the prisoner was poised to be set free years ago after the state’s case against him largely fell apart, but his release was delayed indefinitely during the Trump administration. This week, the Biden administration released Nasser and he was reunited with his family after more than 19 years behind bars.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster">A Message From The Daily Poster:</h3>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>When Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announced that his state would stop sending pandemic-related jobless aid to its citizens this summer, he said it was because the benefits were no longer needed.</p>
<p>“West Virginians have access to thousands of jobs right now,” he declared.</p>
<p>While many in the mainstream media took Justice’s statement at face value, the governor wasn’t telling the real story.</p>
<p>“There isn’t enough jobs out there, and the jobs don’t pay enough,” pleaded one West Virginian to Justice after he made his announcement.</p>
<p>“You’re punishing us and forcing us to work low-wage jobs in a pandemic that’s still ongoing,” said another.</p>
<p>“This unemployment is our lifeline,” said a third.</p>
<p>You won’t find these stories anywhere but at <em>The Daily Poster </em>— because <a href="__GHOST_URL__/i-dont-have-anything/">we uncovered them using open records requests</a>.</p>
<p>We have sent similar requests out to states cutting off jobless aid all over the country. Our plan is to expose the nationwide toll of the lies those in power are telling to cut off benefits that millions of people desperately need.</p>
<p>Doing this work isn’t just about scoring clicks, social media hits, or Beltway newsletter mentions — it’s about fighting for people who need a lifeline during these unprecedented times.</p>
<p>Record requests like this aren’t easy. They are expensive, and involve endless hours of grunt work: sending and following up on requests, sorting through thousands of pages of resulting documents, searching for tiny but pivotal revelations.</p>
<p>It’s why many journalists don’t bother to send many record requests anymore, despite the vital role they play in exposing malfeasance. While we’re still a small outlet, record requests are the backbone of our investigative enterprise. We send out dozens every month, and we’re able to do so only because of your support — both through your subscription, and the additional funds many of you have donated <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/donate/60818189ad12f332071054b8#/donate">through our tip jar</a> for our investigative fund.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>So once again, thank you for your continuing support. Your efforts are allowing us to do the hard work necessary to tell the real story — and hold those in power accountable.</p>
