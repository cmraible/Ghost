They’re defaulting to the politics of compromise and concession that invariably costs congressional Democrats hard-earned majorities and leaves Democratic presidents without the ability to effectively govern. If they keep doing this, they will hand Republicans an undeserved opening in 2022. Whether Manchin, Sinema, and the inequality caucus are motivated by thoughts of campaign donations from corporate interests, deficit-hawk fantasies, or lust for the attention the media invariably lavishes on ‘centrists,’ they are making the mistake that Democrats regularly make at the start of a new administration. Even if last week’s reluctant senators represented only a minority in a party that overwhelmingly favors a wage hike and bold action, they created an image of the Democrats as a status-quo institution that is unprepared to deliver for working people.”"

The columnist writes columns extolling the value of corporations, and the corporations shower the columnist and/or his organization with money. There isn’t a conservative magazine or think tank out there that isn’t funded by big business, the deal being that the magazine or think tank has to praise the virtues of unfettered market capitalism, low taxes for the wealthy, and so on. The conservative media project in large part has, for decades, been about laundering the naked pursuit of corporate profits via Big Ideas, something Brooks excels at.”"

Once, wealth and prosperity were spread out across the country. In the 1960s, the 25 cities with the highest median incomes included Cleveland, Des Moines, Milwaukee and Rockford, Ill. By the middle of the last decade, virtually all of the top 25 were on the coasts. Meanwhile, the gap between wealthy and poorer regions has grown much wider. In 1980, only a few sections of the country had median incomes that were more than 20 percent above or below the national average. Today, big chunks of the country fall into those extremes. The imbalance is unhealthy at both ends of the spectrum. In one set of places, it produces congestion and unaffordability; on the other, blight and stagnation.”"
