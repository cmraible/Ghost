They’re defaulting to the politics of compromise and concession that invariably costs congressional Democrats hard-earned majorities and leaves Democratic presidents without the ability to effectively govern. If they keep doing this, they will hand Republicans an undeserved opening in 2022. Whether Manchin, Sinema, and the inequality caucus are motivated by thoughts of campaign donations from corporate interests, deficit-hawk fantasies, or lust for the attention the media invariably lavishes on ‘centrists,’ they are making the mistake that Democrats regularly make at the start of a new administration. Even if last week’s reluctant senators represented only a minority in a party that overwhelmingly favors a wage hike and bold action, they created an image of the Democrats as a status-quo institution that is unprepared to deliver for working people.”</em></p>

The columnist writes columns extolling the value of corporations, and the corporations shower the columnist and/or his organization with money. There isn’t a conservative magazine or think tank out there that isn’t funded by big business, the deal being that the magazine or think tank has to praise the virtues of unfettered market capitalism, low taxes for the wealthy, and so on. The conservative media project in large part has, for decades, been about laundering the naked pursuit of corporate profits via Big Ideas, something Brooks excels at.”</em></p>

Once, wealth and prosperity were spread out across the country. In the 1960s, the 25 cities with the highest median incomes included Cleveland, Des Moines, Milwaukee and Rockford, Ill. By the middle of the last decade, virtually all of the top 25 were on the coasts. Meanwhile, the gap between wealthy and poorer regions has grown much wider. In 1980, only a few sections of the country had median incomes that were more than 20 percent above or below the national average. Today, big chunks of the country fall into those extremes. The imbalance is unhealthy at both ends of the spectrum. In one set of places, it produces congestion and unaffordability; on the other, blight and stagnation.”</em></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A message from Sirota</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time digging into unpleasant stories and spotlighting hard truths. But it’s worth taking a moment to feel good about a few matters, because they signal that things can change.</p>
<p>I’ve been reporting on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s corruption and bullying for years, and for most of that time, he seemed impervious to accountability. That is no longer the case. He is facing a political crisis, and <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> reporting played a significant role in exposing some of his most malevolent behavior in the legislative arena.</p>
<p>You don’t have to trust me on that. Take a moment and <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1370231545013837825?s=20">watch this short clip</a> of New York lawmakers thanking us for our reporting on the nursing home scandal, and confirming that it has played a major role in their work trying to repeal Cuomo’s corporate immunity law. Our team worked extremely hard on this reporting, and I am really proud that we have made such an impact.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Washington, Joe Biden was forced to finally discard his 40 years of austerity zealotry and support significant spending to help people survive this crisis. As <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-american-rescue-plans-money-cannon/">we wrote this week</a>, the Democrats failed to use this moment’s opportunity to structurally change the economy and confront corporate power, and they may have even made things worse in the health care arena. However, the spending in this bill is a definitive victory over Biden’s past austerity ideology — and we should recognize that.</p>
<p>There is already an effort to pretend that Biden just woke up one day and decided out of the goodness of his heart to suddenly change. That myth is the latest iteration of the Great Man Theory of history that writes social movements and pressure out of the story. It’s complete crap.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Biden was echoing GOP talking points about the deficit (and I’m proud that <em>The Daily Poster</em> was one of the few outlets <a href="__GHOST_URL__/team-biden-now-signals-austerity/">reporting</a> critically on those counterproductive statements). Biden only begrudgingly and belatedly came to embrace a big spending package. His change does not reflect his alleged greatness. It reflects the success of an entire anti-austerity movement that has been protesting, criticizing, fighting, and working hard for years. All of that pressure changed the political environment and successfully forced a president to change.</p>
<p>I agree with Anand Giridharadas who <a href="https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/1370381330685509635">wrote</a> that, “It would be a shame if the people whose pushing and shouting and criticism and righteous rage helped bring about this moment didn’t feel ownership of it. This is what it looks like when you’re beginning to win. Not a pot of gold at once, but faint colors on the horizon.”</p>
<p>Again, as we wrote, the American Rescue Plan’s omissions were a huge disappointment, and progressive lawmakers did not maximize their power to make the bill better. So please, don’t try to accuse me of going soft or selling out. I’m not — <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-american-rescue-plans-money-cannon/">The Daily Poster’s</a></em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-american-rescue-plans-money-cannon/"> report this week</a> was one of the only ones to be honest about this bill’s shortcomings, and I have very clear eyes about the missed opportunities that made the bill worse.</p>
<p>But I also know there are some wins to celebrate here — and one of the biggest wins is how it proves that all the work, pressure, and organizing is not pointless or irrelevant. It can start to move things in the right direction.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of realization that keeps me going in the work we do at <em>The Daily Poster</em> — and it is absolutely true that we could not do it without our supporting subscribers. You being on our team makes this work possible. Let’s keep going.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
