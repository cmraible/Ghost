<p>With a week to go before the special primary election for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District, Democratic candidate Shontel Brown may be in hot water.</p>
<p>In April, <em>The Intercept</em> reported that Brown, a Cuyahoga County Councilmember, had <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/14/cleveland-cuyahoga-shontel-brown-contracts-nina-turner/">voted to award millions worth of contracts</a> to companies connected to her romantic partner and campaign donors. Emails reviewed by <em>The Daily Poster </em>show that the Ohio state auditor’s office reviewed the allegations in the article and recently referred the matter to the state ethics commission.</p>
<p>Under Ohio law, public officials are prohibited from knowingly authorizing or using their authority or influence “to secure authorization of any public contract in which the public official, a member of the public official's family, or any of the public official's business associates has an interest.” Violation of the statute is a felony, and penalties can include prison time.</p>
