<p>Americans have been terrorized by high health care costs and surprise medical bills. Now, there is new evidence that even though a COVID vaccine is free, the trauma of the experience with for-profit health care may be making many people reluctant to get the vaccine, because they fear being hit with unexpected bills.</p><!--members-only-->

    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/upshot/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-cost.html"><strong>The Covid Vaccine Is Free, But Not Everyone Believes That</strong></a> (The New York Times) – <em>Over the course of the pandemic, people have received bills for COVID tests that were supposed to be free, or had claims for COVID treatments denied that were supposed to be covered. As a result, as many as a third of unvaccinated adults fear that they will have to pay for the vaccine, even though they won’t. That could be deterring them from getting vaccinated.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/35197/the-department-of-energy-may-be-the-best-place-to-keep-a-secret"><strong>The U.S. Government Hides Some Of Its Darkest Secrets At The Department Of Energy</strong></a> (The Drive) – <em>“Over the last few years, allegations of secret, exotic technologies have reinvigorated claims that the [Department of Defense] may be concealing scientific breakthroughs from the American public. However, if the U.S. government, or some faction within it, hypothetically came across a groundbreaking development in energy production or applied physics, a very strong case could be made that such a revolution would likely be housed deep within the Department of Energy (DOE) rather than DOD.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://eoinhiggins.substack.com/p/the-difficulty-of-obtaining-an-abortion"><strong>The Difficulty of Obtaining an Abortion in Mississippi Is By Design</strong></a> (The Flashpoint) – <em>Are Mississippi’s abortion restrictions, at least in part, intentional policies designed to maintain a low-wage workforce in the state? For one sociologist, “it’s clear that the economic boon for Mississippi businesses provided by the state's restrictive reproductive healthcare laws is inextricably tied to the religious narrative behind them.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Churchill-For-5-1-million-reasons-Cuomo-s-book-16220389.php"><strong>For 5.1 Million Reasons, Cuomo's Book Was Appalling</strong></a> (Albany Times Union) – <em>“But Cuomo wrote his book (supposedly) as the coronavirus pandemic was stealing lives and causing terrible pain. While a more responsible governor would have been totally focused on the pandemic and its devastation, New York’s instead leveraged the crisis for a massive payday.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/paid-leave-after-miscarriage-us"><strong>Why We Need Paid Leave After Miscarriage in the U.S.</strong></a> (Vogue) – <em>Over one in ten pregnancies end in miscarriage, which can have serious mental and physical health consequences for parents who experience pregnancy loss. Yet, no laws currently exist in the United States to provide workplace protections or paid leave for people who experience miscarriage.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162272/republican-voter-suppression-texas-democracy-reckoning"><strong>Democracy’s Moment of Reckoning</strong></a> (The New Republic) –<em> “The For the People Act faces its own anti-democratic hurdle to passage—not one concocted by the Republican Party, but the legislative filibuster, a long-standing feature of the Senate that the Democratic caucus has the power to eliminate or change. Failing to do so would be more than a mere strategic blunder. The Republican Party is waging an assault on multiracial democracy, which even now, two decades into this new century, remains more aspiration than reality. The inequities of the American political system are already deep. If Democrats fail to act, the Republican Party will deepen them beyond hope of repair, securing minority rule for itself and bringing the project of American democracy to an end.”</em></li>

If the Biden administration is intent on pursuing such a course, it can and should suffer consequences for scaling down its own plans — and have to contend with lawmakers willing to vote 'nay' before allowing the bogus quest for bipartisanship to water down yet another major piece of legislation.”</em></li>

In one State Department meeting, officials seeking to demand transparency from the Chinese government say they were explicitly told by colleagues not to explore the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s gain-of-function research, because it would bring unwelcome attention to U.S. government funding of it.”</em></li>

<p>Friends:</p>
<p>If you're feeling overwhelmed by all the news all the time, rest assured — you are not alone. I've been in and around politics for 20+ years, and lately the pace of news has felt more unmanageable than I can ever remember. </p>
<p>Some days I question whether that's just a sign of getting older, but I don't think that's the whole story. The news cycle really has accelerated. So much is happening simultaneously that it's hard to keep up with any of it. </p>
<p>But that's why we do our subscriber-only publications like <em>The Midday Poster, You Love To See It</em> and this <em>Weekend Reader</em> — they are the kind of features that aim to boil down some of the most important news of the whole week in small digestible nuggets. Indeed, as I've said before — if you read only one email that we produce each week, make it the <em>Weekend Reader</em> because it reviews all of what we've been reporting over the week, and then gives you an eclectic mix of stories from across the world.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we are aiming to launch some more features that bolster our original reporting, and help you sift through the never ending news cycle. The goal is to help you focus on the signal in all the noise — because the noise so often distracts us all from the really important stories.</p>
<p>As we expand <em>The Daily Poster</em>, I often joke that it feels like we're trying to improve and expand the plane while simultaneously flying it. We've made great progress in the first year since we launched — but we have a lot more to do, and we are working overtime to build out a full newsroom. </p>
<p>We couldn't do it without the support of our paying subscribers — so thank you for being part of the team, and stay tuned for more soon. </p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
