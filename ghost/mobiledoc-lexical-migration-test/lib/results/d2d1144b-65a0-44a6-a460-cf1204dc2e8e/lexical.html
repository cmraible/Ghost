<p>On Wednesday 4/28 at 7pm ET (4pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will talk with environmentalist lawyer Steven Donziger and climate journalist Kate Aronoff about the current state of the climate action movement.</p>
<p>Donziger helped win a $9.5 billion case against Chevron for polluting the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. As <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> own Walker Bragman and David Sirota <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/07/steven-donziger-chevron">previously reported</a>, because of a contempt charge in a countersuit filed by Chevron, Donziger has been under house arrest for nearly two years in a case that critics say has unfairly weaponized the justice system against a fossil fuel industry critic. Donziger’s trial on the matter is scheduled to begin on May 10.</p>
<p>Aronoff is a staff writer at <em>The New Republic</em> and author of the new book <em>Overheated: How Capitalism Broke the Planet — And How We Fight Back</em>, which details the forces that have hijacked progress on climate change and what it will take, politically and economically, to address the existential threat of global warming.</p>
