<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> recently published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/workers-are-funding-the-war-on-themselves/">deep-dive report</a> on Wall Street executives skimming billions of dollars of fees off the retirement savings of teachers, firefighters, and other government workers.</p>
<p>The relationship between public pensions and alternative investment firms has become one of the biggest upward transfers of wealth in America — and much of it is happening in secret. That’s because pension officials and the firms collude to keep the investment contracts secret, even to the workers and retirees whose money they are managing. </p>
<p>On this podcast episode, Sirota talks to former SEC attorney Ted Siedle, whose forensic investigations of major pension funds are helping to shed light on this enormous scandal. Siedle is the author of the books <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781612681030"><em>Who Stole My Pension?</em></a> and <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781949642759"><em>How To Steal A Lot Of Money, Legally</em></a>.</p>
