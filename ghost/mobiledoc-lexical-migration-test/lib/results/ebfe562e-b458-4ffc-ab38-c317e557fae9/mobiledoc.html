<p>Less than three years before Republican lawmakers today threw temper tantrums about metal detectors in the halls of Congress, they passed GOP legislation supporting more metal detectors in schools.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Republican-controlled House tried to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/politics/house-school-safety-bill/index.html">head off strict gun control legislation</a> by instead <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2018106?Page=2&amp;Date=03%2F14%2F2018">passing</a> Florida GOP Rep. John Rutherford’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4909">bill</a> authorizing new resources for “evidence-based strategies and programs to prevent violence, which may include the use of appropriate technologies, including the placement and use of metal detectors.”</p>
<p>Among those <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2018106?Page=2&amp;Date=03%2F14%2F2018">voting for the metal detector legislation</a> were Republican Reps. Steve Scalise, Steve Stivers, Larry Buchshon, Louie Gohmert, Rodney Davis, Markwayne Mullin and Steve Womack.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-protest-circumvent-new-metal-detectors-inside-capitol-after-riot-n1254011">NBC News</a> reported that Scalise, Stivers, Bucshon and Gohmert were among the “Republican lawmakers (who) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepLarryBucshon/status/1349159625296404483">complained</a> about — or outright bypassed — the metal detectors to enter the House floor” that were installed after the chamber was attacked in last week’s violent insurrection. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/metal-detectors-house-chamber-lawmaker-trump-removal">Fox News</a> reported that Davis “exchanged harsh words with Capitol Police” about the new security measures and called them “political correctness run amok.” And <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1349161726902677506">CNN</a> reported that Mullin and Womack “erupted at Capitol Police as they were forced to go through” the metal detectors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/1349159121032011777?s=20">Huffington Post</a> reported that Stivers tonight “told the cops at the door he believes the magnetometers are unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, Stivers <a href="https://stivers.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399477">boasted</a> to constituents that he supported “improving school safety by increasing funding for schools to have metal detectors.”</p>
