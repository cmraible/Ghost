<p>With the government recently issuing a new report on UFOs, Sirota talks to journalist Laura Krantz, whose new podcast series, “<a href="https://www.foxtopus.ink/space-invaders"><em>Wild Thing: Space Invaders</em>,</a>” looks at our culture's obsession with the idea of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>The two discuss the government's renewed interest in UFOs, and what science suggests is the most likely explanation for the unidentified phenomena. They also discuss whether or not the recent UFO mania is being driven by a military-industrial complex looking for justification for even larger Pentagon budgets.</p>
