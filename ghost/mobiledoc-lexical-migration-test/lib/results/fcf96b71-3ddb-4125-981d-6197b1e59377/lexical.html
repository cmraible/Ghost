<p>Two-thirds of Americans <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-minimum-wage-idUSKBN2AP2B9">support</a> raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, while only 34 percent oppose the idea.</p>
<p>The Senate Parliamentarian, a nonpartisan adviser that congressional leaders can ignore or fire, has said the Democrats’ proposed COVID relief legislation can hand out <a href="https://twitter.com/GunnelsWarren/status/1366609949158162434">billions of dollars</a> to profitable health insurance corporations. The same advisor doesn’t want the bill to raise the starvation wage to $15 for millions of workers. The justification for these rulings is the so-called <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30862.pdf">Byrd Rule</a>, which is designed to keep non-budgetary matters out of budget bills. However, the Congressional Budget Office has reported that the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/hwaysandmeansreconciliation.pdf">insurance subsidies</a> and the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf">minimum wage</a> would have similar budgetary effects.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>Yesterday, 23 House Democrats demanded that Vice President Kamala Harris overrule the Senate Parliamentarian and decide that a $15 minimum wage can be included in the American Rescue Plan, as <em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/house-dems-demand-harris-advance/">reported</a></em>.</p>
<p>Only two senators, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have spoken out in favor of Harris overruling the Parliamentarian. <em>The Daily Poster</em> contacted the remaining 48 Democratic Senators to ask if they support Harris overruling the Parliamentarian and including a $15 minimum wage in the budget bill. None of their offices have responded. To help us, call their office and ask for their position - and then email us to tell us what they said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidShuster/status/1366526525718339590?s=20">doesn’t seem</a> to be making any efforts to get Sen. Joe Manchin, a key obstacle to a $15 minimum wage, on board with the policy. As David Sirota <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/joe-biden-minimum-wage-democrats">wrote</a> for <em>The Guardian </em>this week, “Whether such pressure ultimately works, the point is indisputable: It is laughable and preposterous to argue that a newly elected president has zero power to even try to shift the dynamic.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden did, however, meet with Manchin and other conservative Democrats to discuss the relief package. Those Democrats are still demanding <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1366546040674021378?s=20">additional limits</a> on survival check eligibility, even though House Democrats have already ensured wealthier households won’t benefit.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster </em>is continuing to track this vital issue. On Wednesday 3/3 at 7pm ET, <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will hear from U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna about negotiations in Congress over the minimum wage. <strong>The exclusive live event for subscribers begins at 7pm ET. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-minimum-wage-live-chat/"><strong>Click here for details and login info</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>In 2016, Neera Tanden was a Hillary Clinton surrogate and one of the loudest voices in D.C. <a href="https://cei.org/blog/bidens-omb-pick-neera-tanden-once-warned-democrats-against-a-15-minimum-wage/">opposing</a> a $15 minimum wage. She brought that <a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/06/25/clinton_appointees_oppose_15_minimum_wage_amendment_in_democratic_platform_sanders_surrogates_back_it/">opposition</a> to the DNC platform committee as a Hillary Clinton appointee. Today, Tanden is Joe Biden’s embattled pick for White House budget director. The administration says it is <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/watch/ron-klain-we-re-fighting-our-guts-out-to-get-neera-tanden-confirmed-for-omb-101545029762">fighting hard</a> to get 50 votes for her confirmation. However, White House Press Secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/1366480414651523073?s=20">explained</a> on Monday the administration cannot get the votes for a $15 minimum wage despite its pledge of support. Tanden’s confirmation battle could be used to help advance the $15 minimum wage, however — if a Democratic senator r<a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1366779663163424768">efused to support Tanden’s nomination</a> unless Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="__GHOST_URL__/breaking-secret-memo-shows-how-harris/">ignored the Senate parliamentarian’s advice </a>and fulfilled the Biden campaign’s promise to boost the wage.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• ANDREW CUOMO HAS A THIRD ACCUSER: </strong>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/nyregion/cuomo-harassment-anna-ruch.html">third woman</a> has come forward accusing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. Anna Ruch, who worked for the Obama administration and the 2020 Biden campaign, told the <em>New York Times</em> that the governor asked her sexually explicit questions. Two other women, Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett, both former aides, have <a href="https://medium.com/@lindseyboylan4NY/my-story-of-working-with-governor-cuomo-e664d4814b4e">publicly</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/nyregion/cuomo-charlotte-bennett-sexual-harassment.html">accused</a> Cuomo of sexual harassment, too. In response to some of these claims, Cuomo said he was being “<a href="https://twitter.com/JonCampbellGAN/status/1366155745398575104?s=20">playful</a>.” In light of the accusations, New York’s attorney general Letitia James has launched an investigation into the matter. Over the weekend, Cuomo <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2021/02/28/andrew-cuomo-sexual-harassment-investigation-new-york-governor/6857760002/">ceded control</a> of that inquiry to her, despite initially resisting. James owes some of her career success to Cuomo, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/nyregion/letitia-james-attorney-general-independence.html">endorsement</a> helped her score the Democratic Party’s nomination.</p>
<p><strong>• BILL BARRING PUBLIC EMPLOYEE WORK STOPPAGES PASSES WV SENATE: </strong>The West Virginia senate <a href="https://wchstv.com/news/local/bill-declaring-it-unlawful-for-public-employees-work-stoppage-strike-passes-wva-senate">advanced a bill</a> that would make it unlawful for public employees in the state to participate in work stoppages, which would prohibit strikes. The legislation represents the latest salvo in an ongoing war over labor rights in the state and a direct response to prominent teacher protests there in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN REOPENS ANOTHER TRUMP-ERA DETENTION CENTER FOR KIDS: </strong>“I would describe it as a place where we keep kids — who are under the age of 18 and taking a treacherous journey into this country — safe,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/02/27/white-house-on-returning-migrant-kids-to-homestead-its-not-a-detention-center-its-a-shelter/">said</a> when asked about the Biden administration’s decision to reactivate the Homestead camp in Florida. The for-profit facility was <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/biden-to-reopen-homestead-shelter-for-migrant-children-11881926">closed in October 2019</a> amid protests over reports of child sexual abuse and human rights violations. Democratic candidates, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, visited the camp on the campaign trail and <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffMiami/status/1365432697645064204?s=20">called for its closure</a>.</p>
<p><strong>• YEMEN’S NINE-YEAR-OLD SCHOOL TEACHER: </strong>In Yemen, school teachers haven’t been paid in years thanks to the ongoing war. In Taiz, one young boy <a href="https://twitter.com/OrlaGuerin/status/1366442435652579331?s=20">fills in</a> as a substitute teacher when there is no adult available. Blind from birth, Ahmed teaches class in the rubble of a bombed-out building as gunshots and bomb blasts sound in the distance. The UK recently announced it was cutting its humanitarian aid to Yemen by <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/utterly-appalling-criticism-as-uk-announces-it-will-cut-aid-to-yemen-by-more-than-half-12232890">more than half</a>, even as it continues to provide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/12/us-lawmakers-urge-uk-to-help-end-complicity-in-saudi-arabias-war-in-yemen">material support</a> to Saudi Arabia’s brutal campaign in the country.</p>
<p><strong>• CANCELING STUDENT DEBT ADDRESSES RACIAL INEQUALITY: </strong>A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/student-debt-cancellation-should-consider-wealth-not-income/">new paper</a> from The Brookings Institute based on 2018 data argues that student debt cancellation ought to be based on net worth, rather than income, because most student debt is held by households with zero or negative net worth. The paper notes that student debt cancellation also reduces racial disparity and that the greater the amount canceled, the greater the reduction in inequality. According to the paper, Sanders’ plan to cancel all student debt would increase more wealth for poor Black households than Warren’s plan to cancel up to $50,000 of debt or Joe Biden’s plan to cancel up to $10,000.</p>
