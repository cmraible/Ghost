Today’s exclusive report — being co-published in The Guardian and Jacobin — breaks some big news about Andrew Cuomo helping a major corporate donor potentially immunize itself from future prosecution. New York lawmakers are in the last week of their legislative session and have a chance to repeal the immunity law — so this is a really important, time-sensitive story. Please give it a read and share it widely. — Sirota"
