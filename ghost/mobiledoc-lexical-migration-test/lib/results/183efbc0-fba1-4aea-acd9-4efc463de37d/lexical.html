<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We’re now 3+ months into doing TMI. We’ve been breaking big stories and making a big impact — but we really want YOUR feedback about our work. So here’s our ask:</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/kTZamHwdqRLMEQZE7"><strong>Please click here and fill out this very short survey</strong></a><strong> about our current work and about some things we are planning.</strong></p>
<p>Your answers will only go to us, they won’t be public. And please — be as brutally honest as you can. We won’t be offended — we need your honest opinions and thoughts.</p>
<p>If you want to publish some public feedback, please use the comments right here at the bottom of this post on the website.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for doing this!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
