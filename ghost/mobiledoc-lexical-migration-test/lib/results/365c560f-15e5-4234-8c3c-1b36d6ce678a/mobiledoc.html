<p>Florida has long been a refuge for drug lords, Mafiosi, and stereotypical <a href="https://grantland.com/features/lifes-rich-pageant-meet-a-florida-man/">Florida Men</a>, but ever since Donald Trump made his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach his base of operations, the state has become a mecca for ever more surreal right-wing shenanigans, from Roger Stone partying with frat boys to GOP stalwarts wearing baseball hats declaring, “DeSantis 2024: Make America Florida.” Among the stories in this week’s Weekend Reader is <em>Vanity Fair</em> correspondent Joe Hagan’s venture into the Sunshine State’s heart of darkness.</p>
<p>That and much more in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/08/the-fury-and-fantasy-of-donald-trumps-florida"><strong>“All Roads Lead to Mar-a-Lago”: Inside the Fury and Fantasy of Donald Trump’s Florida</strong></a> (Vanity Fair) —<em> “Behold Florida, the state that reshaped the conservative vision of America in the age of Trump. Over four tumultuous years, the former president turned Florida into the de facto homeland of the GOP, site of the “Southern White House,” and haloed himself in Floridian allies and courtesans: Florida congressman Matt Gaetz; Palm Beach-based Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs, and Ann Coulter; Jupiter-based Mark Levin; Boca Grande-based Tucker Carlson; Palm City-based Dan Bongino; as well as Sean Hannity, who has a condo in Palm Beach, and newly minted Floridian émigré of the right, Ben Shapiro. They come for the weather, to avoid income taxes, and sometimes for Florida’s Homestead Act, which shields a house from creditors in the event of bankruptcy. It’s also a safe space from liberals. ‘If you’re Sean Hannity, you can’t walk down the street in Manhattan, you get punched in the face,’ says Tucker Carlson, who started taping his Fox News show part-time from Florida after protesters came to his house in Washington, D.C., in 2018.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/08/11/progressives-see-opening-as-andrew-cuomo-falls/"><strong>Progressives See Opening as Andrew Cuomo Falls</strong></a> (The Village Voice) — <em>“For the progressives and socialists stymied by Cuomo, now will be the time to think big. Hochul is a moderate, but she will lack Cuomo’s clout and combativeness. She will seek to make allies, even with those she disagrees with—with an election looming in 2022, she can’t afford to alienate too many interest groups. The Democrats who long for greater funding for public schools, universities, and social services may get it in the next budget. Tenant protections could be strengthened further. A real push could be underway to make statewide single-payer healthcare a reality.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-oral-history-part-i-coming-together/"><strong>A People’s History of Black Twitter</strong></a><strong></strong>(WIRED) — <em>“Black Twitter has become the most dynamic subset not only of Twitter but of the wider social internet. Capable of creating, shaping, and remixing popular culture at light speed, it remains the incubator of nearly every meme (Crying Jordan, This you?), hashtag (#IfTheyGunnedMeDown, #OscarsSoWhite, #YouOKSis), and social justice cause (Me Too, Black Lives Matter) worth knowing about. It is both news and analysis, call and response, judge and jury—a comedy showcase, therapy session, and family cookout all in one. Black Twitter is a multiverse, simultaneously an archive and an all-seeing lens into the future. As Weatherspoon puts it: ‘Our experience is universal. Our experience is big. Our experience is relevant.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/travel/behind-the-fight-to-save-the-gulfs-spectacular-coral-reefs/"><strong>Behind the Fight to Save the Gulf’s Spectacular Coral Reefs</strong></a><strong></strong>(Texas Monthly) — <em>“Flower Garden Banks contains some of the healthiest remaining coral reefs on the planet… But like all coral environments — which are predicted to almost disappear by 2050 — these reefs face threats from climate change, disease, and invasive species. In an effort to save Flower Garden Banks from such perils, an unlikely group of bedfellows worked together for more than a decade to build something almost as rare these days as the reefs themselves: progress through compromise.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/do-these-4000-federal-inmates-belong-behind-bars-2021-8"><strong>COVID Allowed Raquel Esquivel And 4,500 Others To Be Released From Overcrowded Federal Prisons. So Why Is She Back Behind Bars?</strong></a><strong></strong>(Business Insider) —<em> “As Covid cases spread through prisons across the country, Esquivel was told she was eligible for a transfer to home confinement, which would allow her to serve her sentence at home while she was being rigorously monitored. Under a directive set by the CARES Act, the Bureau of Prisons had screened its population of more than 150,000 prisoners for those with a high vulnerability to the coronavirus, who posed a low risk to public safety, and had a record of good conduct; 4,500 prisoners had been approved for home confinement. For the next year, Esquivel and the others would wear GPS ankle monitors and be strictly supervised by probation officers or halfway house personnel. It wasn't clear what would happen afterwards.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/bitcoin-miners-china-texas/"><strong>Why China’s Crypto Cowboys Are Fleeing To Texas</strong></a> (Rest of World) —<em> “Ousted from the provinces where they’d spent years building a footprint, China’s fleeing Bitcoin miners are now looking for stability. They want plentiful, cheap electricity to power their tens of thousands of computers — but they also want the certainty that politics won’t interfere with their operations. Before they can begin displacing the global financial system with a decentralized, peer-to-peer system of exchange, their needs are suddenly much more prosaic: predictable regulation, stable relations with governments, and affordable power.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/how-we-live-coronavirus-forever/619783/"><strong>The Coronavirus Is Here Forever. This Is How We Live With It.</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“That future may be hard to imagine with intensive-care units filling up yet again during this Delta surge. But the pandemic will end. One way or another, it will end. The current spikes in cases and deaths are the result of a novel coronavirus meeting naive immune systems. When enough people have gained some immunity through either vaccination or infection—preferably vaccination—the coronavirus will transition to what epidemiologists call ‘endemic.’ It won’t be eliminated, but it won’t upend our lives anymore.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/is-it-time-to-break-up-big-ag"><strong>Is It Time to Break Up Big Ag?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“The accelerating concentration of the agricultural economy is not confined to dairy. Since 1982, the four largest beef-packing companies went from controlling about forty per cent of the market to controlling more than eighty per cent. The four largest seed manufacturers increased their market share from twenty-one per cent in 1994 to sixty-six per cent in 2018. As a result, farmers are paying more for inputs—seeds, fertilizers—while selling their goods for lower prices and to fewer competitive buyers. ‘It’s as if farmers have become serfs again,’ John Peck, the executive director of the nonprofit Family Farm Defenders, said. ‘They have no independence left, no autonomy—they’re owned by the lord.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/17/1028552251/outdoor-workers-could-face-far-more-dangerous-heat-by-2065-because-of-climate-ch?utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_source=twitter.com"><strong>Outdoor Workers Could Face Far More Dangerous Heat By 2065 Because Of Climate Change</strong></a><strong></strong>(NPR) — <em>“The consequences of that extreme heat can be severe: a new NPR/Columbia Journalism School investigation found that at least 384 workers have died from environmental heat exposure in the last decade. And the problem is getting worse: the three-year average of worker heat deaths has doubled since the early 1990s.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/08/nabisco-workers-strike-portland-colorado-virginia"><strong>Nabisco Workers Are on Strike in Three States</strong></a> (Jacobin) — <em>“The Nabisco strike is another example of a dynamic spreading across industries in the United States: as employers scramble to staff up, many currently employed workers are subjected to mandatory overtime, with bosses seeking to work them to the bone rather than recruit more people — a potentially costly move when workers are hard to find. In response, some workers are using their increased leverage during a period of employer panic over the tight labor market to push back, demanding better wages and working conditions — and much of the time, those demands are about hours and scheduling.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-sirota">A Message From Sirota:</h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The media industry is facing a crisis — and it’s not small. While promoting a flood of vapid clickbait, repackaged propaganda, and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/iraq-war-media-fail-matt-taibbi-812230/">outright lies</a>, the media industry has <a href="https://www.axios.com/media-trust-crisis-2bf0ec1c-00c0-4901-9069-e26b21c283a9.html">lost the trust of millions of people</a> — part of Americans’ more general <a href="https://time.com/5929252/edelman-trust-barometer-2021/">loss of faith in all sorts of institutions</a>.</p>
<p>We launched <em>The Daily Poster</em> to build something different and better: A reader-supported news outlet that focuses on following the money, holding the powerful accountable, and spotlighting information ignored by the corporate press. But the question remains: Is there an audience big enough and committed enough to make that work <em>sustainable</em>?</p>
<p>The answer is: I think so, but I’m still not sure. I want to tell you why.</p>
<p>Right now, the clickbait ecosystem seems to reward the most polarizing jeremiads and the speediest opinions. It is an arms race of ever-hotter takes, regardless of whether the takes are credible, fact-based, and reflective of the nuance of real life. This 24-7 assault has conditioned many news consumers to judge the merits of media information not on whether it helps us better understand the world, but instead on whether the information reaffirms one’s preconceived opinions and can be weaponized for a predetermined political cause.</p>
<p>This dystopia punishes even the most mild, rational nuance. The information ecosystem seems to demand polarity, especially in political content. To say Donald Trump was bad and Joe Biden is better is to get yourself accused of being a shill for the Democratic establishment. To say Biden is still wildly inadequate is to get yourself accused of being a Republican operative. To admit that power players in both parties are sociopathically corrupt is to be accused of saying both parties are exactly the same (they are not).</p>
<p>And maybe worst of all, to write something that some readers may disagree with is to elicit accusations of disloyalty — rather than gratitude for provoking critical thought.</p>
<p>This dynamic creates powerful pressure for content conformity — but it is pressure we will not succumb to. Yes, it may be a better short-term business decision to simply pump out cannon fodder in the partisan wars or offer insta-takes designed to polarize, but that’s not what <em>The Daily Poster</em> is ever going to do, because that’s dishonest and helps nobody.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve been able to build a news outlet on that foundational commitment — and that’s thanks to you, our supporting subscribers. We were blown away by the response we received to launching our new <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/gift">gift subscription feature</a> last week. So many of you have already stepped up and used our special gift discount to provide friends and family subscriptions to our work. There really is no better way to simultaneously support us and spread the word about what we do.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Your support and feedback tells us that you value <em>The Daily Poster</em> providing something different and more substantive than the typical bilge flooding your social media feed.</p>
<p>Whether or not we can expand our work will reflect whether or not there is a growing audience for this kind of journalism. As I said, I think there is — but it’s an uncertain path. Thank you for being on our team as we continue on this journey together. It is an uncertain path, but well worth the effort.</p>
