<p>Friends:</p>
<p>NPR just aired <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/20/915060757/david-sirota-democrats-have-power-to-play-hardball-too">this national report</a> on how our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/primary-schumer-to-guarantee-opposition">journalism</a> is putting significant pressure on Sen. Chuck Schumer to do everything in his power to stop Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. <br></p>
<p>This is a major validation of the journalism we do, and we are right now trying to hire more journalists and expand our coverage.</p>
<p><strong>We are 100% grassroots funded so here’s my ask: can you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a supporting subscriber?</strong></p>
<p>In order to hire more journalists and expand our coverage of the Supreme Court fight and the 2020 election, we need as many free subscribers as possible to <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become supporting subscribers. It’s $5 a month or $50 a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/20/915060757/david-sirota-democrats-have-power-to-play-hardball-too">Listen to the NPR report</a> — it gives you a sense of exactly what we are doing, and how our work is having an impact.

<p>Thanks for considering this request. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
