<p><strong>• KAINE TOUTS THE PENTAGON’S REVOLVING DOOR: </strong>During a Senate Armed Services Committee <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/21-02-02-nomination_hicks">hearing last week</a> Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said: “Many of the nominees and appointments for DOD spots thus far are veterans of the Obama Administration, local think tanks, advocacy groups, all of which is important but none thus far have extensive acquisition or industry experience.” He went on, “the department was well-served in my opinion by some previous officials like secretaries Lord, Geurts, McCarthy, who had sizable acquisition experience…” Their experience? Lord was CEO of Textron and McCarthy worked at Lockheed Martin, two major defense contractors. The Senate has already confirmed Biden’s appointment of Lloyd Austin, a former board member at the defense contractor Raytheon, to serve as defense secretary.</p>
<p><strong>• WHO WILL BE MAYOR OF FACEBOOKVILLE, NEVADA?: </strong>Nevada’s Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has a proposal to attract tech industry development using a 19th century idea. Sisolak’s <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/2021-legislature/bill-would-allow-tech-companies-to-create-local-governments-2272887/">proposed</a> “innovation zones” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-legislation-local-governments-nevada-economy-2fa79128a7bf41073c1e9102e8a0e5f0">would</a> “would permit companies with large areas of land to form governments carrying the same authority as counties, including the ability to impose taxes, form school districts and courts and provide government services.” Maybe it’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1357763815228678149?s=20">logical endpoint</a> of corporate influence in our political system.</p>
<p><strong>• CBO DOWNPLAYED CLIMATE CHANGE, NOW AIMS TO KILL WAGE HIKE: </strong>The Congressional Budget Office––which analyzes the budgetary and economic impacts of legislation––has estimated that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would increase the deficit by <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/537817-cbo-say-15-minimum-wage-would-increase-deficit-54b">$54 billion</a> over the next decade and lead to job loss, <a href="https://twitter.com/EconomicPolicy/status/1358848001180073985?s=20">in contrast to</a> leading literature on the topic. In 2018, the same office <a href="https://grist.org/article/cbo-dismisses-costs-of-global-warming-posing-hurdle-for-climate-legislation/">predicted</a> that climate change would not have a substantial impact on the federal budget, directly contradicting the consensus of federal scientists. There’s good news though: the analysis on the minimum wage increase means that it can be <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1358822350347722762?s=20">passed through</a> the reconciliation process, and Democrats have the <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSegalRI/status/1358833100550262786?s=20">power to replace</a> the current Republican head of the CBO.</p>
<p><strong>• AMAZON WORKERS ARE TRYING TO UNIONIZE: </strong>Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, AL have begun voting in an historic union election today, after months of the company’s best <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/03/amazon-intensifies-severe-effort-discourage-first-warehouse-union">union-busting</a> efforts, aided by <a href="https://twitter.com/jmillerlewis/status/1358427113498550272?s=20">anti-union coverage</a> by Jeff Bezos’s own newspaper. The union drive <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/unions-in-alabama-vow-solidarity-in-amazon-fight/">is resonating</a> with other workers in Alabama and with Amazon workers from other states, and if successful, could affect tens of thousands of people who work for America’s second largest (soon to be largest) employer.</p>
<p><strong>• SUPER BOWL ADS PROVIDE A GLIMPSE OF A DYSTOPIA: </strong>This year’s super bowl ads provided a pretty good glimpse into the current state of American politics: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-dystopian-sales-pitch-on-super/">Dolly Parton glorifying</a> 14 hour workdays and side hustles, <a href="https://heated.world/p/lets-talk-about-that-super-bowl-ad">General Motors greenwashing</a> its climate record, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgross_man/status/1358576953951989763?s=20">Blackstone-backed</a> alternative milk company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oatly-released-t-shirt-widely-hated-super-bowl-commercial-2021-2">selling merch</a> based on the utter stupidity of its own ad.</p>
