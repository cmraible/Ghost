<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>If you’re paying attention to the news — or breathing in ashen air — it’s hard not to feel despondent these days, and I just want you to know: you aren’t alone. I think all of us who aren’t billionaires are feeling it right now.</p>
<p>I’m one of those people who may seem like a pessimist on the outside, but I do this work because I am an optimist. I’ve spent my adult life working on campaigns, doing journalism and now building this grassroots-funded media outlet because I still believe we can turn things around — but I confess that these are among the darkest days I ever remember experiencing.</p>
<p>When I don’t let the darkness overtake me, I am finding more motivation than ever to do this work — and I think you will appreciate our reporting this coming week on the climate crisis, the pandemic and the upcoming election.</p>
<p>This past week is still haunting me. It’s been a few days since we learned that Donald Trump lied to the public about a public health crisis and Bob Woodward suppressed that fact. I’m not over it. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever be over it, because the whole affair has exposed a deep rot at the core of both politics and media. To me, it is the emblematic story of our greed-is-good culture. Trump lied for his own political purposes, and a journalist aided and abetted that crime to juice book sales — and 200,000 people died. Nothing seems sacred anymore — and that’s upsetting.</p>
<p>Some of the reaction to <a href="/bob-woodward-aided-trumps-crime-against">our reporting</a> on this situation elicited some angry responses in defense of Woodward, which only served to stoke the question that haunts me: does anyone really even understand what a journalist’s job is anymore? I genuinely think lots of people do not even know that journalism is not supposed to time the release of stories to elections (or book sales) and is not supposed to publish or suppress information based on a theory of how much a story will change things.</p>
<p>When I went to journalism school, we were taught that in making publishing decisions, you simply evaluate whether information is in the public interest — and you make that evaluation without fear or favor.</p>
<p>The fact that some readers think it is the journalist’s job to shill for particular candidates or aid and abet particular political outcomes — well, it suggests that so much of this country actually wants propaganda, not real journalism. And I’m sorry, any journalist aiding and abetting Trump’s dishonesty is no hero — they should be considered a pariah.</p>
<p>Of course, I very much appreciate all the feedback on our stories — your comments and input are so important to this project, even when we disagree. And here’s the thing: we consider and learn from everyone’s input all the time, but we will never change the fundamental thing we do.</p>
<p>Whether it’s reporting on the pandemic, climate change, economic policy or elections, we aim to hold power accountable, regardless of who that may offend. As the Weekend Reader below proves, if you want party propaganda, that’s not what we do here. We are one of the few outlets that isn’t shilling for a party or a corporate agenda, and frankly, I’m proud of that.</p>
<p>Let me also add one more thing that I know I say often, but is always worth repeating: we couldn’t do this work without the support of our supporting subscribers. So thank you so so so so much for your help in making this accountability journalism project possible. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
