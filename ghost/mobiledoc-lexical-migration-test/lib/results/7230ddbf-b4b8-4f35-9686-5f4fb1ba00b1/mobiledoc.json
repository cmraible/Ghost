I’m not over it. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever be over it, because the whole affair has exposed a deep rot at the core of both politics and media. To me, it is the emblematic story of our greed-is-good culture. Trump lied for his own political purposes, and a journalist aided and abetted that crime to juice book sales — and 200,000 people died. Nothing seems sacred anymore — and that’s upsetting."
