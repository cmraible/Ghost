<p>Friends:</p>
<p>If you want to understand what our grassroots journalism is doing, read this <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/27/democrats-supreme-court-confirmation-421849">Politico</a> story on Senate Democrats suddenly saying they will start trying to block Trump’s Supreme Court pick. This is a welcome reversal of where they were a week ago — before we broke open a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/memo-suggests-tactics-for-dems-to/">series</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/aoc-to-schumer-we-must-use-every/">of</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/primary-schumer-to-guarantee-opposition/">stories</a> about all the different powers they have at their disposal. Those reports <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-senate-confirmation_n_5f6dfe7cc5b64deddeecee7a">went</a><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/09/24/memo-laying-out-delay-tactics-circulates-among-senate-democrats/">viral</a> and have helped generate significant pressure — and now the pressure is starting to work.</p>
<p>We are right now trying to hire more reporters to help us expand our accountability journalism so that we can make even more of an impact. The only way we can do that is if more of our free subscribers <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become supporting subscribers.</p>

We can do a lot more of this if we can hire more reporters.</p>
