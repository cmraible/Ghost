<p>You’ve seen all the big stories we’ve been breaking open over the last year — but as a reader-supported news outlet, we cannot do this reporting without more free subscribers pitching in to become paid subscribers. The good news is that with your help, we can build out an entire newsroom of reporters that holds politicians accountable.</p>
<p>When you become a subscriber, you DIRECTLY fund our accountability journalism that holds politicians accountable. And becoming a subscriber also gets you special benefits: You get access to all our subscriber-only podcasts, live events and exclusive content — and we have a lot more of that in the pipeline.</p>
<p>To understand what you are funding when you subscribe, just <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-boosted-a-pipeline-now-his-aide-could-reap-a-windfall/">take a look</a> at our most recent reporting this week. We broke open the story of a top White House aide now being in a position to profit off the Biden administration’s backing of a controversial oil pipeline during the climate crisis. No other media outlet reported this story — but we did, because our mission is to challenge power and expose corruption, regardless of party. And because of our reporting, the story is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IGRJ-K1ncI">now starting to get attention</a>.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t like asking people to pitch in — I’d rather be spending my time digging through documents and reporting hard-hitting stories. But I’m asking because we really need your help. We are building a reader-supported news outlet, but we can only do that with your help. </p>
<p><strong>Please take this request seriously. <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0">Please use this discount right now</a> — help us continue doing this work and hire a whole newsroom of reporters that holds politicians accountable. </strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Thanks for considering this — I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t really important.</p>
