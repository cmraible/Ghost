<p>Friends:</p>
<p>If you feel like corporate-funded media doesn’t consistently cover corporate power and corruption, you’re right. That’s why we are working so hard to expand this new grassroots-funded journalism project that doesn’t answer to corporate owners. To do that, we need as many supporting subscribers as possible. <br></p>
<p><strong>So here’s my ask of you: can you go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> and become a supporting subscriber? I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been reading this newsletter, you know we are working hard every single day to spotlight huge stories that are so often ignored in the corporate media. Just this week, we’ve published two stories doing exactly that — stories about trillions of dollars of theft and corruption.</p>
<p>Our work is having a real impact — and we are trying to expand what we’re doing. To do that, we need as many folks subscribing to the free version of the newsletter to become monthly or annual paying subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Please click <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber — and encourage your friends to do the same.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks so much for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
