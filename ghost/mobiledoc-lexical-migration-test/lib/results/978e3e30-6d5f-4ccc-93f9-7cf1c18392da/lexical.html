<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Some big breaking news: Judge Amy Barrett was just forced to respond to <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> original reporting on her ties to the fossil fuel industry. You can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/barrett-doubles-down-on-climate-denial/">read all about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Some days I wake up wondering why we do this work — it’s not fun to get attacked everyday for reporting inconvenient facts. But pressuring senators into asking these questions and watching Barrett have to answer them because of our reporting, I know that the work is critical.</p>
<p><strong>And that’s why I need you to go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>dailyposter.com/subscribe</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber to help us expand.</strong></p>
<p>This entire episode shows the power of accountability journalism — and why we’re asking you to <a href="#/portal/signup">pitch in</a>. We are 100% grassroots funded, and can only do this kind of reporting because of our subscribers.</p>
<p>We are RIGHT NOW trying to hire more reporters to hold public officials accountable today, and after the election.</p>

<p>If everyone who gets this email becomes a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber, we can hire an entire newsroom of reporters to hold power accountable.</p>
<p>Think about it — <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> original reporting helped force a Supreme Court nominee to answer uncomfortable questions about one of the most important crises facing our world. This follows our reporting successfully <a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1290456166234021895">pressuring</a> New York lawmakers to repeal parts of a corporate immunity law, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/team-biden-now-signals-austerity/">prompting</a> Joe Biden’s campaign to stop echoing the GOP’s deficit talking points.</p>
<p>We did all that with our small team. Now imagine what we can do with an entire newsroom. And here’s the thing: when you become a subscriber, you aren’t just helping us do more journalism — <strong>you also get access to all of our subscriber-only content and our subscriber events.</strong></p>
<p>I know times are tough out there right now and the economy is in crisis — but we aren’t going to get the change we so desperately need by relying on media that is owned by corporations and billionaires. We need a media that is constantly exposing corruption, following the money, scrutinizing power and shaming politicians. That’s what we are building — and you can see the impact with today’s news.</p>
<p><strong>Please <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to become a supporting subscriber</strong></a> — your subscription goes directly to funding our journalism. And please send this message on to your friends to encourage them to subscribe.</strong></p>
<p>Together, we can build a new kind of media that gets results.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
