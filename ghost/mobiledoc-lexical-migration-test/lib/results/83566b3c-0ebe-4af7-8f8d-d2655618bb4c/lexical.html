<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder — our first Daily Poster live chat starts at 5:45pm ET today. You can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-election-eve-with-sirota/">click here to find all the details</a> about how to participate.</p>
<p><strong>This is a subscriber-only event, so if you want to participate, <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to become a supporting subscriber</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>We are starting a bit earlier than originally announced because we have added Bernie 2020 pollster Ben Tulchin to the lineup. He is going to give us a rundown of the polling in advance of Election Day. Then we will chat with journalist Naomi Klein. You will be able to ask questions of all of us.</p>
<p>I hope you will join the conversation — it should be fun.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
