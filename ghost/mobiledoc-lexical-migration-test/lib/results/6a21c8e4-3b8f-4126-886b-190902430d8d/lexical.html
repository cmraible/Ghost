<p>P.S. Every year on MLK Day, I re-read Dr. King’s 1967 speech at the Riverside Church. You can <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/beyond-vietnam">read it here</a>, or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kinginstitute/vietnam-a-crisis-of-conscience">listen to it here</a>. You can also <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-sirota-127294124/david-sirota-interviews-mlk-aide-vince-harding">click here</a> to listen to my interview with the late Dr. Vincent Harding, the aide to Dr. King who helped him write that speech.</p>
