<p>New York’s now infamous corporate immunity law for nursing home executives has been placed on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/flooraction/?sh=sked2&amp;calnum=17&amp;calver=">the legislative docket</a> for repeal. The law, slipped into last year’s budget by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, shielded nursing homes from liability as they were forced by the governor to accept patients presumed to have COVID into their facilities.</p>
<p>Last Spring, while the national media was celebrating Cuomo, <em>The Daily Poster </em>helped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">break open the story</a> of Cuomo passing the law after receiving huge campaign donations from the corporate group pushing it. As <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/"><em>The Daily Poster</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/"> reported</a> earlier this week, the law has shielded administrators and executives from liability for a wide range of negligence claims, even those that don’t appear to be directly related to COVID.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>• Pandemic unemployment benefits expire in 10 days, and Democratic lawmakers are still negotiating over the size of the benefit.</p>
<p>• A Texas oil company enriched its executives before filing for bankruptcy, leaving taxpayers to bear the cost of abandoned well plugging.</p>
<p>• Biden administration officials with ties to strategic consulting firm WestExec Advisors could make money from a recent sale of a minority stake in the firm, raising ethics questions.</p>
