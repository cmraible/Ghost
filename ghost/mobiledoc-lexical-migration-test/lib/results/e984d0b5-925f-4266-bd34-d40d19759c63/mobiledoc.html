<p>Climate change is intensifying, which means reducing carbon emissions is an urgent priority. As illustrated by some of the stories we highlight below, that is going to require some pretty significant changes in how we define “normal.” For one thing, we will have to reimagine travel, and our expectation of how long it takes to get places. We will also need to reimagine where exactly our population centers should be, so that they are nearer to natural resources that are more insulated from the most extreme climate conditions. And we will need to reimagine Democratic Party politics — and demand that blue states use their power to lead the climate battle.</p><!--members-only-->

An April survey by Redfin found nearly half of Americans planning to move this year factored natural disasters in their decision, bolstering a previous study indicating buyers will incorporate climate considerations when moving in the decade ahead. So where will people go? This is where the Great Lakes and Green New Deal come in.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/we-dont-need-supersonic-travel-in-the-new-normal-we-should-slow-down"><strong>We Don’t Need Supersonic Travel</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “If we’re going to take climate change seriously, it also needs to come with a new aesthetic. We have to start seeing wind turbines on the horizon as kinetic art, not blight, for instance. And we might want to rethink what travel means, something that our pandemic year should have helped us with. At this point, it’s clear that you can conduct a lot of business remotely. What that means is not that we need to stay at home forever but that we could learn to travel slowly, precisely because we can e-mail the whole way, and because, as Zoom insists, people are learning to use it at thirty thousand feet.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162676/democrats-control-new-york-cant-even-pass-climate-legislation"><strong>Democrats Control New York but Can’t Even Pass Climate Legislation</strong></a> (New Republic) <em>“New York already passed ambitious carbon reduction targets in 2019. Democrats now enjoy a supermajority in the legislature there, meaning that the GOP doesn’t have much of a say over whether climate policy can pass or not. And yet, for the second year in a row, no climate packages are likely to come up for a vote before the legislative session is slated to end this week… Climate advocates and organizers are frustrated. They say politicians are refusing to even talk about what changes would make broader climate bills passable; instead, lawmakers are hiding behind secretive processes that allow legislation to be stalled anonymously. That lets them avoid alienating either environmentalists or fossil fuel interests. If forced to take a side during a public vote, they’d wind up riling one of these two groups.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/opinion/zoos-animal-cruelty.html"><strong>The Case Against Zoos</strong></a> (The New York Times) <em>—</em><em>“After being captives of the pandemic for more than a year, we have begun experiencing the pleasures of simple outings: dining al fresco, shopping with a friend, taking a stroll through the zoo. As we snap a selfie by the sea lions for the first time in so long, it seems worth asking, after our collective ordeal, whether our pleasure in seeing wild animals up close is worth the price of their captivity.”</em></p>

It goes like this A) the world is going to hell and B) we’re powerless to stop it. Do you feel it? That aching, infuriating, paralytic sense of powerlessness that defines now? Take a hard look at the world. ‘Climate change,’ aka temperatures rising, mass extinction, ecological collapse, social upheaval, economic dislocation, flood, drought, plague. There sit you and I, shuddering at the mess things are in, hearts pounding in our throats, knowing, desperately, bitterly, we’re totally powerless to really stop any of it. I’m here to tell you a bitter truth. That feeling isn’t just a feeling. It’s not just fatalism. It’s reality. Your gut is right about your powerlessness. And that powerlessness is probably the greatest flaw in the design of the world that we’ve built — or rather, that was built to keep us, more or less, blind, dumb, foolish, hateful, and violent.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-to-live-with-death/"><strong>How To Live With Death</strong></a> (The Walrus) <em>— “Learning how to die really means living with a sense of urgency and purpose. Only the presence of a deadline can provide this. The added twist is that we don’t know, exactly, when the deadline will fall.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-is-getting-serious-about-an-interstellar-mission/"><strong>NASA Is Getting Serious About An Interstellar Mission</strong></a> (Wired) <em>— “Interstellar space exploration has long been the stuff of science fiction, a technological challenge that many engineers believe humans just aren’t up to yet. But an ongoing study by a group of NASA-affiliated researchers is challenging this assumption. The researchers have a vision for a mission that could be built with existing technology.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster"><strong>A Message From </strong><em><strong>The Daily Poster</strong></em><strong>:</strong></h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>David is off this week, so this is Joel Warner, <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> managing editor, with a few personal thoughts to share. Here goes:</p>
<p>Running any sort of media outlet is hard these days. Do you want to know what is especially difficult? Running an outlet like ours that often focuses on the gray areas of politics and policies.</p>
<p>Take our coverage this week. Fervent labor movement supporters were likely pleased by our story tracking the corporate legal industry’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/hiding-the-union-busters/">anti-union efforts</a>, but some of them probably weren’t too fond of our article exposing how <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-backroom-deal-to-kill-single-payer/">labor unions joined with big business</a> to block health care reforms in New York State.</p>
<p>Likewise, conservatives might have appreciated our critiques of President Joe Biden for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/celebrating-amid-a-worsening-crisis/">ignoring the realities of the health care crisis</a> and stacking his administration with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-fossil-fuel-influence-leaks-into-the-white-house/">oil and gas shills</a>. But right-wingers surely weren’t thrilled by our coverage of Republican attorneys general doing the bidding of fossil fuel donors and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/defending-the-climate-criminals/">working to derail</a> a historic environmental case.</p>
<p>And David’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/podcast-elite-groupthink-and-the-lab-leak-theory/">podcast discussion this week</a> with Tom Frank was the very definition of wading into a gray, and somewhat tricky, area: We discussed the extremely controversial COVID-19 Wuhan lab-leak theory, and whether examining provocative topics like that should be avoided simply because bad actors are using the story to fuel their racist and xenophobic agendas.</p>
<p>Focusing on such gray areas, and putting out stories that explore the subtleties of modern politics and corruption, tends to earn us angry comments and pushback on social media. It also means our work is less likely to garner attention from a corporate media that thrives on simple hot takes and zero-sum political gamesmanship. And without that attention, it’s much, much harder for us to get the support we need to continue our mission.</p>
<p>Readership and funding of independent media and progressive outlets has dropped significantly since Trump left office — and that’s not surprising. The world might still be an awful mess, but it also doesn’t seem as apocalyptic as it did a few months ago, so many people probably figure they can stop supporting accountability journalism. After all, why bother with subjects that are complicated and nuanced?</p>
<p>That sort of mindset, however, plays right into the hands of those in power. They want the public disengaging, and they want news outlets ignoring what’s going on beyond the bounds of the partisan echo chamber, because it’s in these gray areas where they are most likely to get away with breaking the rules.</p>
<p>It’s why we are going to keep covering these gray areas, even if it doesn’t garner us much in the way of fans, attention, or funding. These are the subjects that deserve our scrutiny more than any others, and it’s because of your generous support that we are able to do this sort of work, unheralded as it may be.</p>
<p>So, once again, thank you for being part of our team, and letting us delve into matters that aren’t always simple or sexy, but are vital for us to build a better future. We wouldn’t be here without you.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Joel</p>
