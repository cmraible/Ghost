          ", the administration filed a brief to defend in court a Trump-era oil and gas drilling project by ConocoPhillips in the North Slope of Alaska, which environmental groups claim did not take into account environmental impacts. The Interior Department is arguing that the Trump administration complied with environmental requirements and that ConocoPhillips’ lease is valid. The project, known as Willow, is set to produce 100,000 barrels of oil per day for the next 30 years. In January, Biden issued an executive order to examine “legal deficiencies” in the leasing program."
