<p>Why do Democratic politicians try to means-test every social program to the point where they become incomprehensibly complex? Will stock market populism save the republic from the predators on Wall Street? <em>The Daily Poster</em> discussed these topics and more this week with Thomas Frank, the famed author of classics such as <em>What’s The Matter With Kansas</em> and <em>Listen, Liberal.</em></p>
<p>Tom and Sirota review <em>The Daily Poster’s </em>reporting over the course of the last week, and focus in on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/read-my-lips-2000-now/">Democrats’ obsession with means testing</a> and how that undermines universalist social programs. They also discuss the GameStop controversy and how it at once threatens Wall Street kingpins but also celebrates the kind of market populism that was first touted in the boom-bust 1990s.</p>
