<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I’ll make this quick — in the wake of the violence at the U.S. Capitol, we have been working 24-7 to report on the funding stream behind the authoritarian movement threatening our democracy (see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/funders-of-the-insurrectionist-gop/">here</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/end-dark-money-now/">here</a>), and we expect to have more reporting out soon.</p>
<p>To really flood the zone with this reporting, we need to expand our small team — <strong>and because we are grassroots funded, the only way we can do that is if free subscribers <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become supporting subscribers.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve been reading <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you know that we always follow the money behind politics and policy — and you know we’ve broken big stories <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">like this</a> that make a real impact. But this kind of reporting takes time and resources — it involves heavy research, expensive public records requests and hiring reporters.</p>
<p><strong>That’s what you fund when you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here to subscribe</a> — </strong>and remember, supporting subscribers get access to all sorts of exclusive stuff, including our live events, TGIF and The Weekend Reader.</p>
<p>We are right now digging deep into campaign finance records — with your help we can do even more of this accountability journalism.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. Please know that I hate asking for folks to pitch in and subscribe, because I know so many folks are struggling through this tough economy. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
