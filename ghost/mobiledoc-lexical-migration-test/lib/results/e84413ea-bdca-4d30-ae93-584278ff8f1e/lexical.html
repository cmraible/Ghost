<p>Friends:</p>
<p>From time to time, we offer <em>Daily Poster</em> supporting subscribers exclusive deals on stuff you might be interested in, and this deal is a particularly good one: a <a href="https://prospect.org/dailyposteroffer">discount</a> off a subscription to <em>The American Prospect</em>, which I consider one of the best magazines in the country.</p>
<p><em>The Prospect</em> is devoted to progressive muckraking, and it is consistently breaking big news in Washington. The magazine goes deep, giving you the details of political battles and legislative fights.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <em>Prospect</em>’s coverage of everything from <a href="https://prospect.org/first100/wonk-case-for-limiting-eligibility-covid-relief-checks-is-wrong/">Biden’s first 100 days</a>, new <a href="https://prospect.org/blogs/tap/bidens-cabinet-the-scorecard-so-far/">presidential appointments</a>, and the <a href="https://prospect.org/first100/superstar-research-driving-checks-debate-has-problem-chetty-income-data/">stimulus battle in Congress</a>. You’ll see that the <em>Prospect </em>is devoted to deep coverage that makes it easy for readers to understand what’s really going on in Washington. I read it every single day.</p>
<p><strong>Right now, <em>Daily Poster </em>subscribers can <a href="https://prospect.org/dailyposteroffer"><strong>click here</strong></a> for a special 20 percent discount off an <em>American Prospect</em> subscription.

<p>To be clear: We have no financial interest in any of this — we don’t make any money if you use that discount code. But we wanted to provide it to our subscribers as a thank you for supporting our work.</p>
<p>My guess is that if you like what you’re reading at <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you will also appreciate <em>The American Prospect</em>. Indeed, I don’t say this lightly: <em>The Prospect</em> truly is invaluable.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
