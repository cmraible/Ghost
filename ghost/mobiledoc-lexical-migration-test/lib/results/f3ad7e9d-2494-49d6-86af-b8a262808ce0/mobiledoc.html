<p>Corporate law firms and consultants rake in hundreds of millions of dollars busting unions every year, and thanks to a legal loophole, the businesses that hire them don’t have to disclose these controversial activities. The Persuader Rule, a provision of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, a major labor reform bill making its way through Congress, would require companies to disclose when they hire union-busting law firms or consultants during union drives — but the American Bar Association (ABA), the country’s largest legal association, has long opposed the potential rule.</p>
<p>Now, however, in a major rebuke to the ABA, law students and young attorneys are joining forces with some of the country’s largest labor unions to declare, “It’s time to close a loophole that lets lawyers campaign against unions in secret.”</p>
