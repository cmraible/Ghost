<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week was a perfect illustration of exactly what we are building at TMI — we broke four big, original stories that you could find nowhere else: one about a <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/07/steven-donziger-chevron">precedent setting environmental case</a>, another about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-democrats-machine-spent-15">Democrats spending against progressives</a> in primaries, another about the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trumps-pal-just-used-john-roberts">corporate takeover of the Supreme Court</a> and then yesterday’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/breaking-group-that-led-kavanaugh">bombshell about Brett Kavanaugh</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We were able to report these stories out because subscriber revenue has allowed us to bring on board two investigative reporters.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I’ve been asking you to consider <a href="#/portal/signup">clicking here</a> to become a monthly or annual subscriber — because there is a direct link between our reporting and your support.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE consider going to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> to pitch in and become a supporting subscriber — and please send this email on to anyone else to encourage them to become a subscriber as well.</strong></p>
<p>Corporate- and billionaire-owned media will never consistently scrutinize and question the power of corporations and billionaires. We are building grassroots-funded media that works only for you, the reader. Everyday, we are working to unearth the stories about wealth and power that are ignored.</p>
<p>With your <a href="#/portal/signup">help as a supporting subscriber</a>, we can build out a new model for journalism.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
