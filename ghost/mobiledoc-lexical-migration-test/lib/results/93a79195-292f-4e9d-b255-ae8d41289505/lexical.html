<p>Friends:</p>
<p>For the last year, <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been reporting an investigative series on Gov. Andrew Cuomo and corporate immunity — and this week we learned that the FBI is now investigating the situation. This is proof that journalism matters. We appreciate that our reporting is now being credited by <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1370231545013837825?s=20">New York lawmakers</a> and media voices like <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1372699327005605889?s=20">MSNBC’s Chris Hayes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1372701316364038148?s=20">CNN’s Jake Tapper</a>.</p>

<p>I am going to level with you - we are facing a bit of adversity right now. <em>The Daily Poster</em> publishes hard-hitting stories about politicians in both parties — and recently, we’ve faced some attacks and bullying from those who do not want us to ever report anything critical about Democrats. Those attacks have hurt our subscriber numbers, threatening the resources we need to keep doing this work.</p>
<p><strong>We’re not going to stop our reporting - but truly, we need you to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to help us keep doing it.</strong></p>
