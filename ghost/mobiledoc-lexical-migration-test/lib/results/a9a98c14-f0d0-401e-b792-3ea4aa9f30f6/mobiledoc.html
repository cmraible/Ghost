<p>I don’t have live television in my home, because I refuse to subject myself and my family to the 24-7 outrage machine of TV news and politics. So firing up YouTube and watching the debate last night felt like the equivalent of a teetotaler suddenly downing a bottle of everclear. I felt like throwing up, and now I feel hungover.</p>
<p>The debate itself was a series of temper tantrums, meltdowns and freakouts, predictably incited by Donald Trump, who toggled between fantastical lies and white supremacy. Joe Biden began the event looking like he was bored, and only came to life when he took Trump’s bait and started defending private insurance, echoing the cynical “law and order” mantra and distancing himself from a Green New Deal.</p>
<p>In trying to fend off the inane argument that his public option plan would "end private insurance and create a government takeover of health," Biden responded: "It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most states, except governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid.”</p>
<p>Biden's public option plan — which he’s refused to campaign on, but which the health insurance industry is <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/512003-health-care-industry-launches-new-ads-against-public-option-for-convention">vilifying</a> — is technically supposed to be <a href="https://joebiden.com/healthcare/#">available to anyone</a>, but of course that significant detail was nowhere to be found in the debate fun house, even as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/millions-of-americans-lost-health-insurance-amid-pandemic-here-are-options.html">millions</a> of people out in the real world are losing their private health insurance.</p>
<p>Biden improved as the debate went on, trying to fight through the chaos and make decent points about the pandemic and climate change. His best moments of the night were when he finally bothered to briefly mention his own economic proposals — and his plan to start making billionaires pay a little bit more in taxes.</p>
<p>Of course, Biden and his return-to-normalcy campaign don’t talk much about these things because both parties have colluded with their donors to try to make politics about anything other than economic class and corporate power. Elections are now purely wars over culture, etiquette, norms and personal story — and today’s debate about the debate is focused on decorum rather than on millions of people’s lives being ruined by a pandemic, an economic crisis and out of control climate change.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-debate-poll/index.html">polls</a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-won-debate-first-presidential-biden-trump/">show</a> more people believe Biden won the debate, the big winners weren’t anyone on stage. It was racists who were yet again emboldened by the president, and even more so, it was villains who are systematically <a href="/billionaire-gop-donors-firm-reports/">bankrolling elections</a>, <a href="/we-still-dont-know-who-is-paying/">buying Supreme Court seats</a>, pillaging the country and <a href="/the-war-against-the-climate-movement/">scorching the earth</a>.</p>
<p>They got off scot free after the financial crisis, they got off scot free as they’ve pandemic profiteered, they got off scot free last night in a debate that mostly refused to focus on the material well being of millions of people, and they are getting off scot free this morning as the debate analysis revolves around decorum.</p>
<p>This isn’t some accident. The hollowing out of our politics is the outcome of a system designed to produce a particular result. Corporate-bankrolled politicians and millionaires paid by billionaires that you watch on your cable TV roundtables have no interest in scrutinizing, challenging or focusing the political conversation on the power of billionaires and corporations — even though that plutocratic power is the central problem destroying the country and the world.</p>
<p>As an investigative journalist who focuses on following the money and digging through documents, I always find this time of year to be the most depressing and most challenging to the point where I start questioning whether any of the painstaking work of reporting, digging and exposing even matters.</p>
<p>Even more than other moments in our dumbed-down democracy, election season feels like the time that nobody wants to focus on literally anything other than rooting for their home team — issues, crimes and policy outcomes be damned. Having worked on many campaigns, I understand that some of this is the natural ebb and flow of politics, but a lot it is unnatural. In the last decade, each election season — regardless of outcome — has felt like another step in a nihilistic devolution, and last night felt like a giant leap.</p>
<p>In a country whose presidential debates are often lazy and dumb, this debate seemed like a spectacle that was aggressively and deliberately stupid — as if the entire event was designed for the purpose of being an infuriating distraction from stuff like corruption, corporate power and the brutal class war being waged by the oligarchy.</p>
<p>In a sense, distraction was almost certainly Trump’s strategy because his record and policies give him very little to brag about. And the debate format, the punditry, the horse race coverage and the media conversation — the Narrative, as it were — are now perfectly calibrated to give Trump exactly the kind of circus that he wants and that America’s cable-TV-addled psyche responds to.</p>
<p>Rather than the political process being a forum to seriously litigate things like inequality and ecocide, the election is a pro-wrestling match that holds itself out as an infotainment escape from those emergencies. In a pundit-driven political culture that values Winning The Day In Politics over anything else, the material concerns of ordinary Americans do not seem to matter at all.</p>
<p>And yet, in the real world, these crises actually do matter — and they aren’t being put on hold or going away just because the election won’t focus on them. They aren’t going away because the corporate media doesn’t care about them. And they aren’t going away because our presidential debates are now just three dudes yelling at each other.</p>
<p>These emergencies keep getting more intense — and if we don’t use what power we have in our tattered democracy to address them, then that downward trajectory will continue. If nothing fundamentally changes, then everything will fundamentally change for the worse.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind after this horrible election is over — because that’s not the end of the struggle, it’s only the end of the beginning.</p>
