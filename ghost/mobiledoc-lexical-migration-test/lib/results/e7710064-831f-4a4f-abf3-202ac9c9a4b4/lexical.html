<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I’ll make this short: if you like the accountability journalism we’re doing, we need you to <a href="#/portal/signup">become a supporting subscriber</a> — and I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important. We’re very close to being able to expand, but we don’t have corporate or billionaire owners - so sustaining our work requires grassroots funding.</p>

<p>When you become a supporting subscriber, you get access to all of our subscriber-only content and our live events — and we are planning to offer even more exclusive stuff in 2021.</p>
<p>If you go to <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com">dailyposter.com</a> and check out our reporting, you will see we are doing the kind of journalism you can’t find anywhere else. We aim for impact, and we hold powerful people accountable, whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>I hate asking you to pitch in - I know times are tough, and I’d rather spend all my time doing reporting. But I know we cannot sustain this crucial work without your help.</p>
<p>So if you’ve considered subscribing, please click here to do that now.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
