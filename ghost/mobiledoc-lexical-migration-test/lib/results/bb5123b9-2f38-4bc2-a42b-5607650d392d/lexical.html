<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to announce that today we have launched FLASHBACK, a new regular feature that will unearth lost history that remains relevant today. This new feature is available exclusively for supporting subscribers.</p>
<p>Our first edition — <a href="__GHOST_URL__/flashback-when-obama-was-pushed-to">which you can find here</a> — looks back on a moment in which President Obama was publicly pressed to fulfill his promise to support single-payer health care.</p>
<p><strong>You can <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber</strong>.</p>
<p>Becoming a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber grants you access to this ongoing feature and other subscriber-only content. It also supports our efforts to expand our journalism. I hope you’ll consider becoming a subscriber.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
