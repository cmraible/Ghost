<p>After Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1341587611283054592">humiliated herself</a> by throwing cold water on the idea during an MSNBC appearance, <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/state/ohio-senator-sherrod-brown-supports-president-donald-trumps-call-for-2-000-stimulus-checks">Democratic lawmakers</a> from <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/12/23/trump-coronavirus-relief-package-checks-democrats-pelosi-massachusetts/">across the country</a> seem to have finally woken up and realized that there’s an economic emergency unfolding and that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-goes-to-bat-for-blackrock-stays/">“let them eat Federal Reserve lending facilities”</a> is not a compelling message.</p>
<p>But one unique and much-needed voice is bizarrely muted: Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Before we get to the California lawmaker, it’s worth noting that her boss, president-elect Joe Biden, seems to have completely checked out of the current debate, after helping create a debacle.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1341502405221879809">reportedly</a> convinced congressional Democrats to get steamrolled by Mitch McConnell and agree to provide just $600 in direct aid — which Georgia Democratic senate candidate Jon Ossoff rightly called<a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1341425095210901504"> “a joke.”</a> Biden has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-covid-relief-plan-third-stimulus-check/">vaguely promised</a> to push more aid in 2021, but he is not weighing in forcefully on the budget showdown that is unfolding right now. An <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/01/13/biden-cuts-social-security/">austerian to the core</a>, Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-austerity-zealotry-cut-the/">took a dump</a> in the middle of the process, and is now running away from the mess he helped create.</p>
<p>Harris’s absence is more notable and perplexing considering that she is in a position to play a direct role in the legislative standoff. She isn’t just the vice president-elect and she isn’t just any old member of the U.S. Senate that could ultimately decide the fate of the stimulus bill. Harris also happens to be the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3784/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded">lead author</a> of legislation to provide $2,000 a month to individuals during the pandemic.</p>
<p>This wasn’t some small initiative — this was Harris’s big <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/coronavirus-kamala-harris-bernie-sanders-propose-2000-monthly-payments.html">headline-grabbing idea</a> she <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/07/17/second-stimulus-checks-kamala-harris/?sh=542907a67b4a">was making her name</a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/08/12/harris-biden-economic-policy/">pushing</a> during the veepstakes. This was supposed to be a proof point illustrating her progressive credentials and her appreciation of the magnitude of the crisis America now faces.</p>

<p>So where is Harris now?</p>
<p>It’s hard to know what’s happening behind the scenes, but at least in public, she’s been quiet on the issue. Indeed, while she has made some <a href="https://abc11.com/kamala-harris-interview-robin-roberts-stimulus-joe-biden/8818612/">generic comments</a> about Congress needing to pass some form of stimulus, she has not been an aggressive leader on the question of direct aid in the current legislative package. Take a look at her social media feeds and peruse Google News for her mentions — there doesn’t seem to be much of anything from her in the middle of the central budget controversy of the entire crisis.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Perhaps she is just following Biden’s lead. Or maybe she believes some ridiculous 17-dimensional-chess theory that staying out of the fray will help secure a good outcome, in the same way Democrats always come up with rationales to live to never fight another day. Or maybe there’s a more innocent explanation — maybe she just hasn’t gotten around to it but is about to weigh in.</p>
<p>Whether or not she does will tell us a lot about what we can expect from her in the Biden administration. More specifically, it will tell us a lot about whether she plans to be an envoy for the progressive causes she purported to support during her presidential run — remember when she laudably <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/harris-private-insurance-medicare/index.html">said</a> it was time to end the private health insurance system? — or whether she will just appropriate Biden’s austerity ideology as her own.</p>
<p>The significance of this moment for Harris cannot be overstated. As the incoming vice president, a sitting senator and the author of a much more expansive version of the $2,000 proposal right now in front of Congress, she can play a singularly significant role in galvanizing her party behind a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-hunger-coronavirus-pandemic-4c7f1705c6d8ef5bac241e6cc8e331bb">desperately-needed</a> policy that <a href="https://twitter.com/dataprogress/status/1340398470981677057">polling data</a> shows is wildly popular.</p>
<p>This is her chance to lead Democrats to a big win over McConnell in support of a policy that will help millions of people. Let’s hope she seizes the moment and doesn’t decide to just disappear.</p>
