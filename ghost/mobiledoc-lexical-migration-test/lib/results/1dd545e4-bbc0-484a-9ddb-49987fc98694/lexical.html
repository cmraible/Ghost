<p>Just a quick reminder that our <em>Daily Poster</em> live chat starts at 5pm ET today. We will be joined by U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and New York Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-NY) to talk about the ups and downs of the campaigns, how the election will shape the new Congress and legislatures across the country, and what possibilities there will be for progressive reforms.</p>
<p>This is an event exclusively for Daily Poster subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcast live and ask questions in real time.</p>
