<p>Friends:</p>
<p>In the coming days, we’re set to launch a very big expansion project, and I can’t wait to tell you about it. However, to get it fully off the ground, we need just a few more free subscribers to become supporting subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>So for the next 24 hours, we’re offering a special deal to try to get there: <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/b4f49d00">Click here</a> for a big discount off a subscription and you get a ton of stuff.</strong></p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/b4f49d00/">Click Here For A BIG Discount</a></p>
<p><strong>When you use that discount link, you get a whole package deal</strong>. You not only get a full subscription to our exclusive content, you also get access to all our new podcasts, our live events with high-profile guests, and our movie club. You also get our brand new <strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/new-the-citizens-guide-to-holding/">Citizens’ Guide To Holding The Powerful Accountable</a>, </strong>which has been garnering rave reviews.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you directly support our expansion plans to fund more accountability journalism that the corporate media refuses to do.</p>
<p>Take a moment and look at the stories that we’ve broken just in the last few weeks. We’ve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-mocks-sanders-15-wage-bill/">caught</a> senators helping corporate lobbyists try to stop a $15 minimum wage. We’ve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/health-insurer-pressured-employees/">caught</a> a health insurance giant’s schemes to block lower health insurance premiums. We’ve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-benefited-from-bidens-inaction/">caught</a> the president saying nice things about unions, but refusing to deliver on his promised initiative to stop union busting.</p>
<p>These stories were all uncovered by our own original reporting, and major media outlets are picking up and amplifying our coverage. The <em>Washington Post’s</em> top political reporter recently <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1359225670409342982">said</a>: “<em>The Daily Poster</em> became a must-read in a hurry.”</p>
<p><strong>But here’s the thing: We can only report these stories because we are reader supported.</strong></p>
<p>Our expansion plan is designed to do a lot more of that — but we can only do it with your help.</p>
<p><strong>So please <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/b4f49d00">click here to use this special discount link</a> right now to subscribe and help us make this expansion plan a reality.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request. We are so, so close to being able to expand, and so we wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
