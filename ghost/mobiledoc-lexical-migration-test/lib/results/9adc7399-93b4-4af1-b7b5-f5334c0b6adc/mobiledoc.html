<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>Last week, our timing was almost hilarious — hours after I published a <a href="/the-good-news-america-is-not-dead">piece</a> on why we should feel hopeful, Justice Ginsberg died, opening up the possibility of a radical conservative court for the next 50 years. It was a bit deflating, as I summarized <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1307112480007741441?s=20">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, I just want to reiterate: I remain optimistic, even in these dark times.</p>
<p>I don’t think we are through the darkness. I think things are probably going to get more turbulent before they get better. But I also think we are experiencing an awakening like we haven’t seen in decades. The challenge is turning that awakening into constructive, progressive action.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, I wrote a book called <em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307395634">The Uprising: An Unauthorized Tour of the Populist Revolt Scaring Wall Street and Washington</a>. </em>There was a central premise in the book: the public was becoming increasingly angry at a government and economy that was pulverizing the 99 percent, and politics would be defined by the left and right  competing to channel that anger into political change.</p>
<p>I believe that hypothesis has been proven 100 percent correct — and I think unfortunately, we are seeing the right winning that competition right now. But that doesn’t mean the progressive movement is dead — far from it. I hope that what we are seeing on the right is a final so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(psychology)#Burst">extinction burst</a>, before we enter a new era of progressive change. And let’s remember: if there’s one thing this era has taught us, it is that change can happen very quickly.</p>
<p>Call me a hopeless optimist. Call me unrealistic. But that’s what I believe — and I believe it because that is the story of our country. Every major step of progress happened through tunnels of darkness. The process wasn’t pleasant or easy — but it happened because people kept fighting. That’s what this moment calls for — and that’s what we are focused on in this grassroots-funded media outlet that you are supporting.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. We’ve been working to try to limit our emails to once a day so that you don’t get overwhelmed — but just remember: even if you don’t read every day’s email, subscribers will always get this Sunday email that includes a review of everything we did over the past week. So if you only read one email every week, make it this one.</p>
