<p>The oil and gas industry is in a panic over climate-minded investment strategies and Joe Biden’s moderate approach to global warming. Meanwhile, Buffalo elects a socialist mayor, most Americans remain unaware of the country’s new child tax credit starting next month, and the Supreme Court steps in to maintain a draconian standard for student debt cancellation.</p>

<p>Thanks to mounting efforts to address climate change, the oil and gas industry is in a panic these days, according to comments in a new <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Documents/research/surveys/des/2021/2102/des2102.pdf">Dallas Fed Energy Survey</a>.</p>
<p>As one fossil fuel executive noted in response to the survey: “We have relationships with approximately 400 institutional investors and close relationships with 100. Approximately one is willing to give new capital to oil and gas investment. The story is the same for public companies and international exploration.”</p>
<p>Another respondent complained of the administration’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-weak-pause-on-drilling-permits/">suspension of new oil and gas leasing</a> on federal lands and in offshore waters, calling the pause “very detrimental to the country.” While a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/climate/biden-drilling-federal-land.html">blocked that pause</a> earlier this month, Congressional Democrats have indicated they are working on legislation to limit public-lands drilling moving forward.</p>
<p>Still another executive lamented “the administration's attitude toward oil and gas,” saying “it is obvious that there is no basic understanding of the fact that, for the present and near term, the economy is absolutely dependent on the oil and gas industry to provide the energy to fuel the economy.”</p>
<p>In truth, Biden has taken a moderate approach on climate change. He has not called for a ban on fracking, and the fossil fuel industry has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-fossil-fuel-influence-leaks-into-the-white-house/">a significant presence</a> in his administration. Andrew Light, Biden’s choice for the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for international affairs, even <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/daily-on-energy-climate-measures-in-question-as-biden-seeks-coalition-for-infrastructure">pledged</a> in a confirmation hearing to promote liquified natural gas exports.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, oil and gas executives are clearly upset about climate-minded politicians and activists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hFTR6qyEo">drinking their milkshake</a>. As one survey respondent complained, “With the environmental, social and governance ‘green stuff’ — and now the federal government using the Treasury Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and others to essentially ‘wage war’ against a legitimate and legal American industry — I’m pulling back on all investments in all businesses.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>Distribution of the Internal Revenue Service’s revised child tax credit under the American Rescue Plan, which will send parents monthly installment payments totaling up to $3,000 per child per year, is set to begin next month. The move was billed as a way to cut child poverty rates in half, increase the earnings of the country’s poorest families by 33 percent, and is a major step forward in the United States towards <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/bidens-child-tax-credit-as-universal-basic-income/">implementing a universal basic income</a>. However, a <a href="https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2021/06/22/child-tax-credit-amount-how-much-3000-3600/">new Data For Progress poll</a> found that <strong>53 percent </strong>of Americans know little to nothing about the program.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>On this day in 2014, a federal court <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/24/headlines">released</a> an internal Obama administration memo outlining its legal rationale for carrying out the 2011 drone strikes that killed four American citizens overseas, including Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. The memo, authored by former Justice Department official David Barron, argued that the killings were authorized under the 2001 Authorization of Military Force (AUMF) as al-Awlaki had joined al-Qaeda.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>• CORY GARDNER HEADS TO K STREET: </strong>Former Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who lost his bid for reelection in the fall, has <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2021/06/23/gardner-heads-downtown-796102">joined</a> Reince Priebus’ lobbying firm, Michael Best Strategies. Gardner is the latest in a string of Republican lawmakers to join a K Street lobbying firm. However, none of the recent hires have yet to register to lobby, as all of them are subject to a “<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/ethics/50-state-table-revolving-door-prohibitions.aspx#:~:text=Prohibitions%20on%20this%20practice%2C%20often,time%20after%20leaving%20public%20service.&amp;text=For%20example%2C%20some%20states%20exempt,agency%20or%20other%20governmental%20entity.">cooling-off</a>” period ranging from six months to two years, as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>• ACTIVISTS ARRESTED PROTESTING FOR VOTING RIGHTS: </strong>Activists, including members of the Poor People’s Campaign, were <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/06/23/were-not-going-away-nonviolent-protest-over-voting-rights-ends-arrests-dc">arrested</a> on Wednesday protesting the failure of the For the People Act, the Democrats’ sweeping voting rights and democracy reform bill, in the Senate. The crowd had gathered in front of the U.S. Supreme Court to demand the legislation’s passage.</p>
<p><strong>• ARMS MANUFACTURERS DONATE TO ELECTION OBJECTORS: </strong>The political action committees (PACs) for arms makers Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and BAE Systems are <a href="https://thebrick.house/publicly-funded-weapons-companies-donate-to-election-objectors/">donating</a> again to congressional lawmakers who voted against certifying the Electoral College results. Each of the companies received at least 85 percent of their 2019 revenues from government contracts.</p>
<p><strong>• FLORIDA TO PROPAGANDIZE STUDENTS: </strong>On Tuesday, less than two weeks after <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/florida-bans-critical-race-theory-ron-desantis-black-lives-matter-what-is/10780246/">signing a bill</a> banning the teaching of Critical Race Theory, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/nation-world/florida-civics-to-teach-communism-evil/507-6b1855ed-e453-4f67-b5b9-f798062b631b">signed</a> civic-education legislation requiring students to learn about “the evils of communism and totalitarian ideologies.” At the <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2021/06/22/gov-desantis-signs-civic-literacy-bills-takes-aim-at-socialism-communism/">same time</a>, DeSantis signed a separate bill to protect diversity of thought on state university campuses by barring public universities from shielding students from speech that is "uncomfortable, unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive.” As the governor noted at the signing, “You have orthodoxies that are promoted and other viewpoints are shunned, or even suppressed. We don't want that in Florida.”</p>
<p><strong>• SUPREME COURT KILLS STUDENT DEBT CASE: </strong>On Monday, the Supreme Court denied Thelma McCoy’s groundbreaking petition to have $350,000 of student loan debt cancelled, a case that could have helped <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/04/biden-student-debt-loan-forgiveness-bankruptcy">ease the country’s growing student debt crisis</a>. McCoy had argued that a series of accidents had left her with diminished job prospects and unable to pay off the debt. In denying McCoy’s petition, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/that-s-a-brunner-man-supreme-court-6106667/">declined to revisit the overly strict Brunner standard</a>, the rule that says debt can only be forgiven if the borrower’s financial status is unlikely to improve for a substantial part of the repayment period. If the Supreme Court had agreed with McCoy’s petition for a more lenient “totality of the circumstances” standard, student loan debtors across the country might have found it easier to discharge their student loan debt.</p>
