<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The transition from Trump to Biden has a lot of media outlets wondering about their future. Many have spent the last four years minting profits off either constantly promoting Trump or exclusively berating him, while ignoring everything else in American politics.</p>
<p>For <em>The Daily Poster</em>, the transition doesn’t require us to change much — we’ve been covering both parties from the beginning and that is what we will continue to do. But that is hardly a safe path. After the trauma of the Trump years, some left-leaning news consumers seem to crave their own version of Fox News that touts reassuring Democratic Party propaganda, and eschews reporting that might be inconvenient to Democratic politicians.</p>
<p>That’s not what we do — and frankly there are moments I worry that because we don’t do that, we could see less support for this kind of accountability journalism we are focused on. That said, this is a risk we have no choice but to take, because it’s not worth the slog of doing this work if you aren’t living up to some core principles, and our principles are clear.</p>
<p>In the last week alone, we’ve published <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-biden-lifts-health-care-plan/">scoops that Biden sycophants hate</a>, and we’ve published <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-moves-to-reverse-one-of-trumps/">reporting that Biden fans probably like</a>. That’s because we are not committed to only publish bad or good news - we are committed to following the money, scrutinizing power and telling the truth, regardless of whether that truth is painful or enjoyable to one or another politician or political party.</p>
<p>That has always been our commitment to you — and we so appreciate you being part of the team. We could not do this work without our supporting subscribers — and we promise to keep holding power accountable, even as party control has changed in Washington.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
