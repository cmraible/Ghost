<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We had a huge week of reporting — and we have some really big stories coming up. But to pull them off, we’re trying to hire another reporter. We can only do that if a few more of our free subscribers pitch in to become supporting subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE — <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>It’s $5 a month or $50 a year. All of the money goes to helping us hire more journalists and expand our reporting.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-amazon-covid-outbreak-followed/">Click here</a> to take a look at at our big story yesterday about Amazon and the Trump administration. You could only find that story at <em>The Daily Poster </em>because the corporate media doesn’t cover that kind of thing. Our story gives you a sense of the journalism we do every single day.</p>
<p>Our supporting subscribers directly fund that journalism. We couldn’t do that kind of reporting without them. And here’s the other thing: when you become a subscriber, you get access to all of our subscriber-only content.</p>
<p>So again, <strong>please <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for considering this request — I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
