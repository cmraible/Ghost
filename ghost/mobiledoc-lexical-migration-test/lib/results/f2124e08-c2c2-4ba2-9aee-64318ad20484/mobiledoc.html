<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>Last week was one of those weeks where we didn’t just publish some big stories, we also got a lot done behind the scenes on our plans for expansion. I can’t wait to tell you more about that — all I can say right now is that it’s a ton of work to try to get everything exactly right, but we are on our way thanks to subscribers’ support.</p>
<p>Labor Day is the traditional beginning of the Final Stretch Of The Presidential Campaign™ — and understandably, everyone seems a bit antsy. Is Trump going to turn it around? Is Biden going to blow it? It is unknowable — but as you’ll see in this week’s must-reads below, there are legitimate fears about an enthusiasm gap for Biden, even though he leads in the polls.</p>
<p>As much as we’re focused on the election thats coming, though, the real world in the present — today — remains a mess, and we will have a few stories this coming week looking at the here and now. I absolutely <a href="https://discourseblog.substack.com/p/accountability-cant-wait">agree</a> with our friends at Discourse Blog that accountability and action cannot keep waiting until the next elections over the horizon — as the saying goes, we have to walk and chew gum at the same time.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I remain mystified about how anyone is staying entirely sane through this tumultuous moment. As the father of two young kids who aren’t in school and the spouse of an elected official running for reelection, I have that drinking-from-a-firehose feeling from the moment I wake up until the moment I fall asleep. I just can’t keep up with everything and I feel like I’m failing all the time (and I want to apologize to everyone if I’ve been a little slow to respond on email!).</p>
<p>That said, I always try to remember one thing: we are all in this together, and everyone is going through this. We’re all doing the best we can — and stuff like <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1302426197981159424?s=20">outdoor Super Mario Brothers</a> is getting me through it.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for pitching in to support this newsletter project. I hope you can see by all the clips how hard we are working every single day — and we wouldn’t be able to do that work without your support. Please email me directly or use the comments at the bottom of this post to give me any feedback about the newsletter.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>

The odds are now very much against American democracy surviving.”</em></p>
