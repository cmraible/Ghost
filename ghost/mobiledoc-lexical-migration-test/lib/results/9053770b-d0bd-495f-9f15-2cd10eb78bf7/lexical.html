<p>Friends:</p>
<p>For weeks, <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been focusing on where <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-slush-fund-bankrolling-the-insurrectionist/">the real corrupting money</a> in politics is — it’s not in relatively small corporate PAC donations, it is in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-slush-fund-bankrolling-the-insurrectionist/">dark money</a> and super PAC donations from corporate executives. We’ve specifically <a href="__GHOST_URL__/end-dark-money-now/">reported</a> on ways public pension official controlling trillions of dollars can expose and shut down this money — and now, there’s very <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/blackrock-pension-funds-capitol-riot/">big news today</a> that some of them are starting to take action.</p>
<p>This is the kind of reporting we do — we follow the money and hold politicians accountable. But we are grassroots-funded and cannot do this kind of work without your help.</p>
<p><strong>To keep doing this work, we need free subscribers to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to become supporting subscribers.</strong></p>

<p>I want you to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-year-of-accountability-journalism/">take a look at this link</a> to see how our reporting brings pressure on both parties — you’ll see the successes we’ve had. But here’s an admission: This work is risky.</p>
<p>Last week, we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-biden-lifts-health-care-plan/">broke some news</a> about Democrats kowtowing to the health insurance industry, and we lost some subscribers who were mad that we dared to report something negative about Democrats. We’ve also recently broken a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-slush-fund-bankrolling-the-insurrectionist/">big story</a> on a GOP slush fund of corporate cash, and that made others mad at us.</p>
<p>We are not going to back down, but it shows you how tough it is to do accountability journalism in this environment. It’s the kind of reporting that not only elicits a backlash from some people, it also takes a lot of time and resources.</p>
<p><strong>The only way we can do it is if folks <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to pitch in</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>The cool thing is that when you pitch in, you aren’t just helping us continue doing this work — you get access to all of our live events where you can ask high-profile guests questions, and you get our subscriber-only content, like the <em>Midday Poster</em>, <em>You Love To See It</em> and <em>The Weekend Reader</em>. And we’re going to be launching more soon.</p>
<p>We are building a new model for journalism — but again, we really cannot do it without your help. So please — <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> and join our team as a supporting subscriber. Together, we can continue making a bigger and bigger impact.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
