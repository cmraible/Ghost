<p>“Contributions from corporate PACs are one of those things that regular people think are important but insiders know couldn’t be less material. In other words, suspending donations from these PACs is the perfect low-cost distraction that you can use to win a news cycle.” - Recode senior reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/1348686335838547969">Teddy Schleiffer</a>.</p>

Journalist David Cay Johnston <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidCayJ/status/1348643545129869323?s=20">points out</a> that “Trump’s handpicked latecomers now running the Pentagon pooh-poohed the insurrection, calling it mere ‘First Amendment Protests’ in an official timeline of law enforcement and military inaction that day.” After Johnston’s report, Pentagon officials <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jan/08/2002562063/-1/-1/1/PLANNING-AND-EXECUTION-TIMELINE-FOR-THE-NATIONAL-GUARDS-INVOLVEMENT-IN-THE-JANUARY-6-2021-FIRST-AMENDMENT-PROTESTS-IN-WASHINGTON-DC.pdf">say</a> the document in question “has been updated to more appropriately reflect the characterization of the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th.”</li>
