<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder about tonight’s special <em>Daily Poster </em>live chat on Thanksgiving Eve!</p>
<p>The entire <em>Daily Poster</em> team will be there to answer subscribers' questions. We are going to try to answer everyone’s questions — and we are going to try to bring subscribers on stage, so have your camera and audio ready. In advance of the event, you can start posting your questions right now at the event link below. Just go to the link and at the bottom of the screen there will be “Ask A Question.”</p>
<p>It will be an open discussion about all the news of the day, and all of our plans for 2021. Grab a beer and join us — it’s going to be fun. Bonus: we’ll tell you a little about the new subscriber-only product we’re about to launch.</p>
<p><em><strong>These live events are exclusively for Daily Poster subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcasts live and ask questions in real time. Please register for the event ahead of time at the Crowdcast link below.</strong></em></p>
