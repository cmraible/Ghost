Andrew Cuomo and is <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1365334764794781699?s=20"><em>at the center</em></a> of New York’s current nursing home scandal. Now, the repeal legislation is before the state senate.</em></p>

The rising left-wing politicians aim to challenge the state’s entrenched corporate, carceral, and propertied power structures, where gender-based and racial abuses flourish.”</em></p>
