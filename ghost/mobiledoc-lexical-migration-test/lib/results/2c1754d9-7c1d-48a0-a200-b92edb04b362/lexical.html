<p>Joe Biden is stacking his administration with fossil fuel allies, suggesting he might be limiting his administration’s environmental efforts, as progressives have long feared. Meanwhile, a new poll provides good news for the pro-choice movement, while a controversial rallying point in the climate change battle has been declared officially dead. </p>

<p>“There are certainly more senators with reservations about the filibuster that are giving Manchin steam to stay firm.

<p>President Joe Biden is giving the fossil fuel industry a commanding voice in his administration. Last week, the president announced his picks to fill administration jobs. One of those was Neil MacBride, a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, to serve as general counsel to the Treasury Department. In 2017, MacBride, representing ExxonMobil, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/lawyer-who-sued-treasury-department-for-exxon-nominated-1847062686">sued the Treasury Department</a> after it fined the fossil fuel giant $2 million for violating foreign sanctions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<div class="ctx-autosidebar-container"></div><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew Light, Biden’s nominee for the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for international affairs, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/daily-on-energy-climate-measures-in-question-as-biden-seeks-coalition-for-infrastructure">pledged</a> to promote liquefied natural gas exports at his confirmation hearing this week.</p>
<p>“My job in this role is to make sure U.S. gas is competitive around the world,” he told Republicans at his hearing. “More and more countries are looking for cleaner sources of gas. Russia has the dirtiest source of gas right now. We’ve got to make sure ours is cleaner and that ours fill those markets around the world. That’s what I intend to do.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>On the campaign trail, Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/21/the-energy-202-democrats-slammed-biden-on-climate-change-but-what-would-a-middle-ground-even-look-like/5ce2e8aba7a0a435cff8c0f6/">caught heat</a> from fellow Democrats after an advisor of his claimed that the former vice president was trying to find a “middle ground” on climate change. At the time, Biden had not signed the ‘No Fossil Fuel Money’ pledge. Biden subsequently distanced himself from that position and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-gWq7UMnC7sqKpzCFqInA4cupLBsOhcdz9TRtSDqMFI/edit?ts=60c1c790#heading=h.5tn45vxbzogj">signed the pledge</a>. However, his new administration picks are a troubling indication that he’s still trying to find that middle ground on climate action.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>A new Gallup poll found that <a href="https://myfox8.com/news/record-high-47-percent-in-us-believe-abortion-is-morally-acceptable-poll-finds/">47 percent of Americans</a> now believe that abortion is morally acceptable, as opposed to 46 percent who feel abortion is morally wrong. The 47 percent figure represents a record high for the two decades Gallup has been running the survey.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>In October 2009, Sen. Joe Lieberman (Ind.-Conn.) <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/lieberman-ill-block-vote-on-reid-plan-028788">vowed to join with Republicans</a> to block Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Medicare buy-in plan, which would have provided the country with a public insurance option.</p>
<p>"We're trying to do too much at once," Lieberman claimed at the time. “To put this government-created insurance company on top of everything else is just asking for trouble for the taxpayers, for the premium payers, and for the national debt. I don’t think we need it now."</p>
<p>At the time, Democrats had 60 votes in the Senate, including Lieberman, as Paul Kirk <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/kennedys-seat-is-temporarily-filled/">had been appointed</a> to fill the late Sen. Ted Kennedy’s seat the month before.</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/health/policy/15lieberman.html">caved</a> to Lieberman and dropped the Medicare buy-in plan from their health care bill, even though Lieberman had long supported a Medicare buy-in. He backed the concept as Al Gore’s running mate in 2000, and expressed support for the policy <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2009/12/democrats_dropping_public_opti.html">as recently as September 2009</a>. However, in 2006, Lieberman ranked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/health/policy/15lieberman.html">second in the Senate for insurance industry donations</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<div class="outpost-pub-container" data-btn-donation-all></div><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Now that Democrats have full control of Congress for the first time in a decade Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is playing the Lieberman role. He recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/06/us/politics/joe-manchin-op-ed.html">pledged to vote against</a> the “For the People Act,” the Democrats’ landmark voting rights and campaign finance reform legislation, after <a href="https://twitter.com/MondaireJones/status/1402252455526776833">co-sponsoring</a> the bill in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>• TESTER, SINEMA, MANCHIN JOIN GOP TO BLOCK TAXES ON RICH: </strong>A trio of conservative Democratic senators — Montana’s John Tester, Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema, and Manchin — have <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/557557-bipartisan-group-rules-out-tax-hikes-on-infrastructure">joined with Republicans</a>, promising to block tax hikes on high earners as part of the White House’s proposed infrastructure bill. Their opposition ensures that Biden’s infrastructure plan does not have enough Democratic votes to pass without GOP support.</p>
<p><strong>• FOX NEWS FEED EXPOSURE ALTERS DEMOCRATS’ PERCEPTIONS: </strong>A <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/abs/partisan-media-effects-beyond-oneshot-experimental-designs/7D6000A7D5FA1B556DC4AA7C48350380">new Cambridge University Press study</a> found that prolonged exposure to an online Fox News news feed decreased Democrats’ perception that FOX reports unfairly. The same was not true for Republicans exposed to an MSNBC news feed — although GOP stalwarts subjected to a Fox news feed ended up more likely to believe the conservative news channel was unfair.</p>
<p><strong>• FORT LAUDERDALE ENDING HOMELESS PROGRAM AS COVID CASES DECLINE: </strong>Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fort-lauderdale/fl-ne-homeless-hotel-program-coronavirus-20210608-c35eppe76ffjdgpgcvnx4tscmm-story.html">planning to end</a> a program it implemented at the height of the pandemic to house the homeless in hotel rooms now that COVID numbers are dropping. Caseworkers are working feverishly to find new long-term housing options for the program’s clients.</p>
<p><strong>• DELTA COVID VARIANT MORE DANGEROUS: </strong>The Delta COVID-19 variant, first identified in India, has <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/557641-delta-covid-19-variant-has-the-potential-to">experts on edge</a>. Although it only accounts for 2.5 percent of infections in the U.S., that’s up from 1.3 percent on June 2. Vaccines appear effective against it, but experts say there is still cause for concern, particularly in the fall if Americans do not get vaccinated in large enough numbers.</p>
<p><strong>• STATES BEGIN CUTTING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: </strong>This weekend marks the beginning of the end of federal unemployment benefits in four Republican states. Missouri, Alaska, Iowa, and Mississippi are making benefit cuts as a way of forcing people back to low-paying jobs. “I will go back to being very, very poor and not paying any money on anything except basic necessities,” one Missouri woman <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/unemployment-benefits-ending_n_60bfc1b7e4b0e6bab7a131cd">told <em>HuffPost</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>• OSHA LIMITS COVID SAFETY GUIDELINES: </strong>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s long-awaited emergency COVID-19 workplace safety standards will only cover jobs in health care settings and will <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/09/biden-limits-covid-rules-health-care-492634">not apply</a> to regular workplaces, the Labor Department announced this week. Unions and employee advocacy groups had expected the rules to be applied far more broadly, as Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/somehow-there-are-still-no-safety-standards/">had promised</a>, in order to protect workers during the pandemic. The announcement is likely a relief to industry groups that have been lobbying against the new regulations.</p>
