<p>This week, Sirota and Tom Frank discuss the campaign for a higher minimum wage. Joe Biden campaigned on a promise to enact a $15 minimum wage and as recently as six weeks ago, the White House and top Democrats were <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/biden-democrats-hit-gas-push-15-minimum-wage-75578498">signaling</a> that they were determined to make sure it was included in must-pass COVID relief legislation that needed only 50 votes to pass through the reconciliation process.
