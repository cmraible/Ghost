<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Earlier today, TMI broke open a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trumps-postal-service-chairman-has">very big story that’s gone viral</a> — digging through documents, we reported out how Trump installed a GOP super PAC official to run the postal service.</p>
<p><strong>If you like this kind of reporting, please consider helping us expand it by going to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> and pitching in to become a supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>We are on the verge of trying to hire more reporters and implement an expansion plan for this kind of journalism. Today’s story shows you exactly the kind of work that we do and that we’re aiming to do more of.</p>
<p><strong>The only way we are able to do this work is by being a GRASSROOTS-FUNDED media outlet funded by subscribers. So that’s why I’m asking you to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here and become a supporting subscriber</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>With your help, we can do even more of this kind of work that challenges power and scrutinizes both parties.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
