An organization that calls itself the Rainforest Flying Squad is managing blockades on logging roads into Fairy Creek and Caycuse, two adjacent old-growth watersheds near the town of Port Renfrew. Fairy Creek is said to be the last unprotected, intact old-growth watershed on southern Vancouver Island. Both valleys are home to trees that rival the world’s largest. ‘No matter what government or industry tells you, they’re still logging old-growth forests on huge scale across Vancouver Island and B.C.,’ says Watt.”"

Each implicates something about how we, collectively, live on the planet. And each suggests that many things need to change.”"
