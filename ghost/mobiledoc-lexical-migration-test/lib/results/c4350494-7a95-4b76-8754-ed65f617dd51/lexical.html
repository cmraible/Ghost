<p><strong>• Biden’s Quiet But Important Moves Against Wall Street </strong>— <em>As a senator, Joe Biden was a <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/biden-bankruptcy-president/"><em>Wall Street-friendly legislator</em></a>. But amid progressive pressure during the first few months of his presidency, Biden’s administration has been taking a somewhat tougher stance against the financial industry. The administration <a href="https://twitter.com/austinrramsey/status/1375072734489800706?s=20"><em>reversed a Trump rule</em></a> that allowed banks convicted of foreign felonies to manage retirement assets; refused to help JPMorgan Chase throw out a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2021/weinstockjpmorgan011121-14a8-incoming.pdf"><em>shareholder proposal</em></a> requesting more information on the company’s political activity; and kept the financial industry’s influence out of <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/building-back-better-than-expected/"><em>key appointments</em></a> to top positions in the government. Now, Biden is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/politics/biden-tax-plan-explainer/index.html"><em>reportedly considering</em></a> hiking the capital gains tax — a tax on income from investments — and the corporate tax rate to fund his policy priorities.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://prospect.org/environment/climate-of-opportunity/promise-of-offshore-wind/"><strong>The Promise of Offshore Wind</strong></a></strong> (The American Prospect) — <em>“The United States has the potential to harness more than 2,000 gigawatts of energy from offshore wind, according to the Global Offshore Wind Report. The Department of Energy estimates that East Coast offshore has the potential to provide about 35 percent of power needs for the entire country by 2050. But that will require supportive policies and a politics to match.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/03/amazon-public-relations-working-conditions-union-bessemer-alabama"><strong>Amazon’s PR Flacks Are Starting to Sweat</strong></a></strong> (Jacobin) — <em>“Amazon got to where it is by its ruthless pursuit of profit. The company will say anything that it thinks will help clear obstacles to that goal from its path. This latest PR blitz is just the latest example, but there is now one key difference: Amazon’s workers have started getting organized, and that means they and their duly chosen representatives can counter the company’s lies.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/26/bernie-sanders-medicare-expansion-478166"><strong>Bernie Pushes Medicare Expansion In Democrats’ Next Big Bill</strong></a></strong> (Politico) — <em>Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders is pushing to include a massive expansion of Medicare in the Democrats’ infrastructure bill, which would be bankrolled by forcing drug companies to negotiate prices with Medicare. His proposed legislation would lower the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 55 or 60, and raise up to $450 billion over the next decade through the drug pricing negotiations.</em></p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://theappeal.org/politicalreport/virginia-death-penalty/"><strong>Virginia Becomes First Southern State To Abolish The Death Penalty</strong></a></strong> (The Appeal) — <em>This week, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam signed legislation to abolish the death penalty in the state that has executed more people than any other in the nation, including 113 people since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The law was passed after <a href="https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/1375507499537682436?s=20"><em>Democrats took power</em></a> in the Virginia state legislature last year, for the first time they had done so in decades.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/pro-act-labor-senate-vote-filibuster/"><strong>Landmark Labor Legislation Will Get A Senate Vote With 50 Co-sponsors</strong></a></strong>(The Intercept) — <em>“Democrats will bring sweeping labor reform for a floor vote in the Senate if its backers can round up at least 50 co-sponsors, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., recently told AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka, according to two sources with knowledge of the conversation.” The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, known as the PRO Act, currently has 45 co-sponsors in the Senate, just five short of the 50 needed to get a floor vote in the Senate. A coalition of groups including labor unions, the Democrat Socialists of America, and the Sunrise Movement are turning up the heat on key Senators to support the legislation.</em></p>
