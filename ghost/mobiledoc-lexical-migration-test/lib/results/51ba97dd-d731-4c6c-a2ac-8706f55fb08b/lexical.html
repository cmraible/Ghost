<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We started this accountability journalism project to make a real-world impact — and that’s exactly what’s happening: Last night, top New York lawmakers explicitly credited our work for exposing the scandal now engulfing Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and for helping them work to repeal a corporate immunity law that has caused so much pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we were given a platform on NPR to discuss our reporting on Democrats’ horrible rejection of a minimum wage, proving that we are helping to change the media conversation, and better focus it on the issues that matter.</p>
<p><strong>This is what accountability journalism looks like in practice. But as a grassroots-funded outlet, we can only continue to do it if free subscribers decide to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here and become supporting subscribers</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Please, we need your help right now — and we wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t truly important.</p>
