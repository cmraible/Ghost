That dredged up painful memories of an election that was stolen by Republicans.</p>
<p>Could that happen again? The new HBO documentary <em>537 Votes</em> implicitly asks that question as it reviews the fateful election in Florida 20 years ago. The film unearths the history of local Florida politics and GOP’s Orwellian tactics to try to halt vote counting in the name of protecting democracy.</p>
<p>This must-see film is out today. <em>The Daily Poster</em> caught up with its director Billy Corben to discuss the ongoing legacy of the 2000 election, and what has — and has not — changed since the debacle.</p>
