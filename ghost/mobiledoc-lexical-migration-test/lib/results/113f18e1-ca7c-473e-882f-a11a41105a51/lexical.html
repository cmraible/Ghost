<p>“Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.” — Eugene V. Debs, September 1918</p>

<p>On Monday, the Senate parliamentarian <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/5/22367832/senate-democrats-budget-reconciliation-filibuster">advised Democrats</a> that they can pass more bills using budget reconciliation, a convoluted process that allows bills related to spending to pass with a simple 51-vote majority, rather than the 60 votes usually needed to end the opposing party’s filibuster and move legislation to a vote. That may sound like good news, since Democrats only have 51 reliable votes in the Senate, but the process cannot be used to pass many of the party’s key priorities into law.</p>
<p>Just last month, Democrats passed a COVID-19 relief bill that excluded a promised $15 minimum wage because the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, said the measure wasn’t a budget item and shouldn’t be part of a reconciliation bill. Democrats could have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/breaking-secret-memo-shows-how-harris/">overruled the parliamentarian</a> and kept the measure in the bill, but chose not to.</p>
<p>There’s little chance that Democrats will be able to pass voting rights legislation or their new union rights bill using the reconciliation process.</p>
<p>The truth is that Democrats must still eliminate the filibuster, since using reconciliation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-could-lose-their-majority-at/">will not prove to be a valid ongoing substitute</a>. Democrats may be able to pass spending bills using reconciliation, but they cannot govern.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat"><strong>TODAY’S STAT:</strong></h4>
<p>Almost $34 million of military equipment was sent to law enforcement agencies around the country in the first quarter of 2021 through the 1033 program, which the Pentagon uses to funnel combat gear to police departments. But it is <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/04/biden-pentagon-police-military-weapons-equipment-1033-executive-order">within Joe Biden’s power</a> to limit or reverse the equipment transfers through executive order. Biden was expected to reimpose Obama-era restrictions on the program, but he has yet to do so.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>“I happen to be a proponent of a single payer universal health care program… I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its Gross National Product on health care cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that’s what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. And that’s what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we have to take back the White House, we have to take back the Senate, and we have to take back the House.” — <a href="https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/obama-for-single-payer-before-he-was-against-it/">Barack Obama in 2003</a></p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• MAJORITY OF COUNTRY AT HIGH RISK OF RIGGED ELECTIONS: </strong>A <a href="https://represent.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gerrymandering-Threat-Index-RepresentUs.pdf">new gerrymandering report</a> from the nonpartisan group RepresentUs has concluded that 35 states are at high or extreme risk of partisan redistricting, based on who is allowed to draw up new election maps and the amount of legal protections in place. That means more than 188 million people are at risk of having their election districts rigged for political gain in the next ten years. As the report notes, “Passing the For the People Act (H.R.1/ S.1), or a similar reform bill, would all but eliminate the threat of rigged congressional maps nationwide.”</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN LOBBIED TO RELEASE VAX IP: </strong>Activists, poorer nations, and some Democrats in Congress are <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/05/fellow-democrats-pressure-biden-to-weaken-vaccine-patents/">urging</a> President Biden to loosen intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines to aid the global fight against the virus. Drug companies argue that doing so would harm their efforts to create boosters for new COVID variants.</p>
<p><strong>• SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS COULD BE PUBLIC UTILITIES: </strong>On Monday, the Supreme Court dismissed as moot a lower court ruling that President Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked his critics on Twitter because the platform had banned the president. In his concurring opinion, conservative Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/05/984440891/justice-clarence-thomas-takes-aims-at-tech-and-its-power-to-cut-off-speech?utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=politics">suggested</a> that social media platforms have too much power to control the discourse and ought to be considered public utilities and regulated as such.</p>
<p><strong>• COVID-19 CASES ARE SURGING AS SCHOOL REOPEN: </strong>In Michigan, which <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/01/08/gov-whitmer-expected-encourage-person-instruction-schools/6595679002/">has been reopening schools</a>, COVID cases are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-michigan-cases-spike-kids/">increasing most</a> among children. The highest jump occurred in those under 10, among whom cases increased 230 percent since February 19. Among young people ages 10 to 19, cases rose by 227 percent, the second-highest jump. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/04/05/as-schools-reopen-covid19-cases-climb?fbclid=IwAR1M87WVu2zHpqOl9tosIjx19WgyTWI_w6zgnui7XjNe7ZFmR6DIeg8Z0OA">752 schools</a> have experienced COVID outbreaks.</p>
