<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/politics/stimulus-checks-economic-hardship.html"><strong>Stimulus Checks Substantially Reduced Hardship, Study Shows</strong></a> (<em>The New York Times</em>): The previous two rounds of survival checks, which totaled $2,000 per person, “significantly improved Americans’ ability to buy food and pay household bills and reduced anxiety and depression, with the largest benefits going to the poorest households and those with children,” according to an analysis of Census Bureau data. The data serve as further evidence that direct cash payments are an effective tool in reducing poverty.</p>

City Council Calls On Biden To Cancel Student Debt</strong></a> (<em>The Hill</em>): The eight members of the Washington, D.C. city council unanimously passed a <a href="https://cmlewisgeorgew4.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sense+of+the+Council+Student+Loan+Debt+Cancellation+Resolution+of+2021.pdf">resolution</a> this week calling on the federal government to “urgently address the student loan crisis and enact a plan to cancel student loan debt and begin the transition to education as a public good.” The city councils of Boston, Cambridge, and Philadelphia <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/washington-dc-cancel-student-loan-debt-biden-low-income-2021-6">passed similar resolutions</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-pharma-may-finally-lose-this-one/"><strong>Biden Has A Bipartisan Opportunity To Lower Drug Prices</strong></a><strong></strong>(<em>The Daily Poster</em>)<strong>: </strong>More than two decades after now-Senator Bernie Sanders visited Canadian pharmacies to promote drug pricing reform, Biden has an opportunity to actualize a policy that would lower drug prices. “Biden following through on his campaign promise to support importation would be an easy way to satiate his bipartisan fetish — something he can do without passing new legislation. Polls have long shown that the idea of drug importation is wildly popular among voters across the political spectrum, and it has support from both Democratic and Republican elected officials,” David Sirota reports.</p>

<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162593/green-new-deal-cori-bush-public-electricity"><strong>These Lawmakers Have A Plan For The Public To Take Back The Grid</strong></a><strong></strong>(<em>The New Republic</em>)<strong>: </strong>“The new resolution — co-sponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Mondaire Jones, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Marie Newman, and Raúl Grijalva — calls out the 'fundamental conflict when shareholder gains determine the prices and accessibility of fundamental public goods,' and outlines several suggestions to scale up public and community-owned clean power while fighting energy poverty. It sets goals to expand job-creating weatherization and energy efficiency programs and guarantee that public renewables are built by local, ideally union workers making prevailing wages,” reports Kate Aronoff.</p>

The program was allowed to expire, in part, because “think tanks, activists, labor unions, and NGOs from the right and left united behind a push to end Chapter 313, which they hadn’t done before,” reports Pat Garofolo.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/joe-biden-social-movements-left-infrastructure-stimulus"><strong>Joe Biden’s Progressive Economic Turn Was Shaped By Social Movements</strong></a><strong></strong>(<em>In These Times</em>)<strong>: </strong>“...One can find solid rationale for believing that social movements had a significant role in pushing the spectrum of policy on key issues. In doing so, they both contributed to the leftward migration of the Democratic Party and set the stage for Biden’s bold proposals for government spending.”</p>
<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://www.corvallisadvocate.com/2021/oregon-legislative-aides-unionize/"><strong>Oregon Capitol Aides Just Became The First Legislative Employees In The Nation To Unionize</strong></a> (<em>The Corvallis Advocate</em>): “As of Friday, May 28, Oregon Capitol Legislative employees joined the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 89, making them the first legislative employees in the nation to unionize. As a result of this unionization, Oregon Capitol aides will have more input into how the building runs.”</p>
