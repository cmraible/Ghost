<p>“I think all of us have received donations from different groups. That doesn't mean you’re owned because somebody gives you money. So I'm not going to hold that against you.” — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/10/sander-tanden-confirmation-468350">Sen. Lindsey Graham</a> helping Biden budget director nominee Neera Tanden try to fend off questions about her think tank’s corporate donations.</p>

<p>While conservative Democrats have spent weeks trying to radically limit who’s eligible for $1,400 COVID survival checks, a new <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/02/10/covid-19-stimulus-checks-income-threshold-polling/">Morning Consult</a> poll shows roughly six in ten Americans support the current $75,000 individual income threshold or believe it should be increased. Although nearly 100 percent of millionaire television pundits want the checks slashed, their propaganda campaign hasn’t caught fire with the public — only 28 percent of respondents in the country at large said the income limit should be lower.</p>

<p><strong>• BERNIE PRESSES TANDEN ON CORPORATE FUNDRAISING: </strong>As president of the Center for American Progress, Neera Tanden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/05/neera-tanden-biden-omb-cap/">raised tens of millions</a> from Wall Street and large corporate donors, including health insurance companies and defense contractors. Tanden is Biden’s choice to lead his budget office, which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-preserves-key-ethics-loopholes/">will be tasked</a> with deciding whether administration officials should get waivers allowing them to work on matters involving their former corporate clients. During her confirmation hearing Wednesday, Tanden faced tough questions from Sen. Bernie Sanders about CAP’s donors.

<p><strong>• BIDEN NATIONAL SECURITY PICKS HAVE DEFENSE INDUSTRY TIES: </strong>Biden has selected a dozen people to serve in his administration who previously worked for, or held affiliations with, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a hawkish D.C. think tank. A <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/new-report-finds-serious-conflicts-of-interest-at-top-national-security-think-tank-sought-out-by-biden-administration/">new report</a> from the Revolving Door Project found that CNAS has taken large contributions from military contractors and foreign governments, and made policy recommendations that served their interests. One of the report’s authors says “the scale and scope of conflicts of interest that appear in CNAS’s work and the influence that its donors may be exerting on policy further highlights serious concerns about political corruption.”</p>
<p><strong>• MORE ASSET MANAGERS QUESTIONED ABOUT DARK MONEY DISCLOSURES: </strong>More than two dozen state treasurers and pension trustees <a href="https://twitter.com/majorityact/status/1359551654975127553?s=20">are calling on</a> the six largest asset managers to demand companies agree to comprehensive disclosure of political spending. Fiduciaries of retiree money had previously called on asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard to demand disclosure, as <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/greenwashing-wall-streets-invisible/">reported</a>, but have expanded these calls to extend to four more firms.</p>
<p><strong>• UNION BUSTERS CUT THE VACCINE LINE: </strong>A hospital system in Maine hired out-of-state consultants to run a union-busting campaign to fight a union drive among some of its staff. Then, the hospital offered COVID vaccines to the consultants, in violation of state policies mandating that vaccines only go to Maine residents. Read more in the <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2021/02/07/flouting-cdc-rules-mainehealth-offered-vaccines-to-all-employees-even-remote-workers/">Portland Press Herald</a> and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maine-hospital-brought-in-anti-union-consultants-from-out-of-state-and-vaccinated-them_n_6023ecf4c5b6c56a89a5e7b7">HuffPost</a>.</p>
