<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>We are about 50 subscribers away from being able to expand our newsroom in 2021, so that we can aggressively cover the new Biden administration. If you’ve thought about subscribing, please do it now, if you can. And here’s a special end-of-the-year discount code that you can use:</p>

<p>You’ve seen the impact our reporting has had - we are proving that we can build a grassroots-funded independent news outlet that breaks big stories. If we get 50 more subscribers, we will be in a solid position to expand this work.</p>
<p>Remember: when you subscribe, you get access to all of our live events and subscriber-only content, which we will be expanding in 2021.</p>
<p>I hope you will consider this request. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important. Please, <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/b4f49d00">click here to subscribe</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for considering this.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
