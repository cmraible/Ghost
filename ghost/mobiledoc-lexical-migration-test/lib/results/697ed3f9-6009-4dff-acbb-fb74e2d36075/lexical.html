<p>Corporate law firms and consultants rake in hundreds of millions of dollars busting unions every year, and thanks to a legal loophole, the businesses that hire them don’t have to disclose these controversial activities. The Persuader Rule, a provision of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, a major labor reform bill making its way through Congress, would require companies to disclose when they hire union-busting law firms or consultants during union drives — but the American Bar Association (ABA), the country’s largest legal association, has long opposed the potential rule.</p>
<p>Now, however, in a major rebuke to the ABA, law students and young attorneys are joining forces with some of the country’s largest labor unions to declare, “It’s time to close a loophole that lets lawyers campaign against unions in secret.”</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-big-news">TODAY’S BIG NEWS:</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, eight organizations including lawyers, legal organizations, and some of the country’s biggest labor unions sent a letter to Congress in support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and rebuking the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/hiding-the-union-busters/">the opposition of American Bar Association</a> (ABA), the country’s largest legal association, to some provisions of the legislation.</p>
<p>“It’s time to close a loophole that lets lawyers campaign against unions in secret,” said Molly Coleman, executive director of People’s Parity Project, an organization of law students and young attorneys working to reform the legal profession, which organized the <a href="https://www.peoplesparity.org/coalition-of-legal-organizations-lawyers-and-labor-groups-challenge-anti-union-bias-at-american-bar-association/">letter.</a> “Our professional ethics shouldn’t become just another weapon companies use against their employees.”</p>
<p>Other signatories include the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union, and the National Employment Lawyers Association. The letter was sent to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, where the PRO Act is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>The ABA has long opposed the Persuader Rule, a provision of the PRO Act that would require companies to disclose when they hire union-busting law firms or consultants during union drives. Corporate law firms rake in hundreds of millions of dollars busting unions every year, and legal ethics experts believe <a href="__GHOST_URL__/hiding-the-union-busters/">these firms have helped fuel</a> the ABA’s opposition to the Persuader Rule, <em>The Daily Poster</em> previously reported.</p>
<p>According to the letter just sent to Congress, “workers often have no idea that anti-union talking points are crafted by third parties — information that, like disclosure requirements on campaign advertisements, informs workers’ votes.”</p>
<p>The Persuader Rule would change those disclosure requirements to mandate that companies publicly disclose any time they hire firms to advise them during union elections, even if those firms don’t directly interact with employees.</p>
<p>“Union-busting consultants script employers’ anti-union campaigns from start to finish,” said Sejal Singh, an organizer with the People’s Parity Project. “Just like voters deserve to know who’s flooding the airwaves during a Presidential election, workers deserve to know who’s writing the threatening texts they get every day and coaching their bosses on how to scare workers into voting against the union while just toeing the legal line. Congress shouldn’t give modern-day Pinkertons a pass just because they happen to be lawyers.”</p>
<p>The Senate currently does not have the votes to pass the PRO Act. There are three Democratic holdouts: Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Mark Warner of Virginia. Labor unions and the Democratic Socialists of America are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-grassroots-battle-to-change-americas/">running a pressure campaign</a> to flip those senators — but even if they signed on, the Senate would need to reform the filibuster to pass the bill, since it is unlikely that any of the 50 Republicans in the Senate would back it. President Joe Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-benefited-from-bidens-inaction/">could also</a> enact the Persuader Rule via executive order.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/560993-only-23-percent-of-americans-are-hopeful-for-a-better-political">new poll</a> by the America 250 Foundation found that just <strong>23 percent of American adults</strong> have hope for a better political system. The poll, which also found that only 38 percent are hopeful for the future, was conducted as part of a national campaign preparing for America's 250th anniversary on July 4, 2026.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>On this day in 2015, President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/01/politics/obama-note-to-castro-reestablish-ties/index.html">announced</a> the formal re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The U.S. planned to relax some restrictions on the country and reopen an embassy in the island nation for the first time since 1961. The move came after the Obama State Department removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.</p>
<p>“Americans and Cubans alike are ready to move forward. I believe it’s time for Congress to do the same,” said Obama, who visited the country the following year, becoming the first sitting president to do so in almost a century. “We’ve already seen members from both parties begin that work.”</p>
<p>When Donald Trump took office, however, he altered course to apply “maximum pressure” on Cuba. In June 2017, he reimposed travel and business restrictions on the country and the following September, cut embassy staff in half. Days before Trump left office, his state department redesignated Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/biden-slams-trump-abject-failure-venezuela-well-cuba-policies-n1239356">criticized</a> Trump’s Cuba policy as an “abject failure.” In March, however, Biden press secretary Jen Psaki <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article249826558.html">said</a> changing course was “not a priority” for the new administration. Despite <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-coronavirus-embargo/">mounting pressure from congressional Democrats</a>, he has not shifted course nearly half a year into his administration.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>• GOP LEADER SAYS OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE IMMINENT: </strong>Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice chair of the House Republican Conference, was <a href="https://twitter.com/lawindsor/status/1410244279142912004">caught on camera</a> predicting that Amy Coney Barrett would author the opinion to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the Supreme Court decision that protects a woman’s right to an abortion. Johnson, who vocally pushed for Barrett’s nomination, said he’s known the justice since high school and that feels confident in his prediction. Once <em>Roe is </em>gone, Johnson said, “it goes back to the states, and then we have the real battle.”</p>
<p><strong>• HEDGE FUNDS TURN TO PR: </strong>A lobbying group representing hedge funds is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/hedge-funds-launch-effort-to-boost-image-as-d-c-scrutiny-mounts">launching</a> a multimillion dollar ad campaign targeting Capitol Hill as lawmakers look to regulate the hedge fund industry. The new campaign, which will highlight partnerships between hedge funds and charitable organizations, marks a shift for the industry, which has typically preferred to operate behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>• PERDUE TOOK SWEETHEART LAND DEAL FROM BIG AG: </strong>A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/sonny-perdue-adm-land-deal/">new investigation</a> by <em>The Washington Post</em> has found that a company belonging to Sonny Perdue, Donald Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture, purchased valuable land from one of the country’s largest agricultural companies for pennies on the dollar just weeks after the president nominated him for his role. Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), the agricultural company, initially wanted $4 million for the land when negotiations began in 2015, but ultimately sold it for $250,000. ADM subsequently spent millions lobbying the Trump administration.</p>
<p><strong>• ISRAEL CONTINUES ETHNIC CLEANSING: </strong>In Silwan, a neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, Israel is demolishing Palestinian homes. On Wednesday, the government <a href="https://twitter.com/ajplus/status/1409859552225419271">bulldozed</a> a Palestinian shop and tear-gassed residents. The government ordered the eviction of 13 families in the neighborhood, telling them they had 21 days to demolish their homes or be on the hook for the cost of doing so.</p>
<p><strong>• MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT H.R.1: <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/7/1/voters-support-for-the-people-act">New polling</a></strong> from the progressive polling outfit Data For Progress finds that 62 percent of Americans support the For The People Act, the federal voting rights legislation also known as H.R.1 or S.1. Only a quarter of Americans oppose the law. The polling, which was conducted from June 22 to June 24, also shows that 57 percent of Americans support the creation of a public financing system for congressional candidates, which would match private donations with public funds for qualifying candidates, as opposed to just 29 percent who oppose it.</p>
<p><strong>• CANADA HEAT WAVE KILLS DOZENS: </strong>One Tuesday, a small town in British Columbia set Canada’s heat record with temperatures over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/canada/bc-canada-heat-wave.html">121 degrees Fahrenheit</a> — part of a deadly heat wave sweeping the west. So far, hundreds of people have died in Washington state, Oregon, and parts of Canada from the sweltering heat. Experts say climate change has raised baseline temperatures by almost 2 degrees on average since 1900.</p>
<p><strong>• SUPREME COURT DEALS HEAVY BLOWS TO DEMOCRACY: </strong>The Supreme Court recently decided two cases that could have serious negative consequences for American democracy. In <a href="https://www.axios.com/supreme-court-political-donors-california-709684f8-7374-449d-a02d-275f3f150339.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">one 6-3 ruling</a> along party lines, the court struck down a California law requiring nonprofits to disclose their donors to state officials. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/01/998758022/the-supreme-court-upheld-upholds-arizona-measures-that-restrict-voting">another party-line ruling</a>, the court upheld two controversial Arizona voter suppression laws — one that invalidated ballots cast in the wrong precinct, and another that banned the collection of absentee ballots by anyone other than a voter’s relative or caregiver. The ruling effectively invalidated what little protections were left in the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the landmark law that banned voting discrimination.</p>
