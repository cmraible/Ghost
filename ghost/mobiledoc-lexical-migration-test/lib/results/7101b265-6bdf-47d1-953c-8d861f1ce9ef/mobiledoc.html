<p>23 House Democrats are demanding Vice President Kamala Harris overrule the Senate parliamentarian’s advisory and push to include a $15 minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan  — a move supported by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. <em>The Daily Poster </em>has reached out to the remaining 48 Democratic senators asking if they would support Harris taking such action. So far, none have provided an answer.</p>
<p>The White House has reportedly not been pressuring Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic holdout, to support  the $15 minimum wage — but there is a way for Democrats to use Neera Tanden’s budget director nomination to push the Biden administration to fulfill its campaign promise to raise the wage.</p>
<p><strong>On Wednesday, </strong><em><strong>Daily Poster </strong></em><strong>supporting subscribers will talk to U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, who is leading the fight for the $15 minimum wage. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-minimum-wage-live-chat-968/">Details here</a>.</strong></p>
