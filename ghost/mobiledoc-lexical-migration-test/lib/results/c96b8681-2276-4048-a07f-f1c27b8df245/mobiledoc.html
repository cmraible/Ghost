<p>Friends:</p>
<p>There’s a lot of unpleasant news out there right now, so I thought I would share some fun news — I’m co-producing the upcoming Adam McKay blockbuster film called <em>Don’t Look Up, </em>which is set to star Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio, among others.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with Adam and journalist Ron Suskind on the project for a while, and the news of the film is now public. This new role is in addition to my ongoing reporting here at <em>The Daily Poster</em> and my work on an upcoming podcast series about the financial crisis.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/netflixs-don-t-look-features-183500218.html">Yahoo</a> notes, the new film has “a ridiculously star-studded cast” — it is set to star not only Lawrence and DiCaprio, but also Rob Morgan, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Matthew Perry, Kid Cudi, Jonah Hill, Himesh Patel and Tomer Sisley. So yeah, that’s a pretty epic cast.</p>
<p>This new film is perfect for this moment: as the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/adam-mckay-comedy-dont-look-up-starring-jennifer-lawrence-lands-at-netflix">press release</a> announcing the film says, it “tells the story of two low-level astronomers, who must go on a giant media tour to warn mankind of an approaching asteroid that will destroy planet Earth.”</p>
<p><strong>To be clear: My main job continues to be building </strong><em><strong>The Daily Poster</strong></em><strong>, our grassroots-funded accountability journalism outlet. So no, working on this film does not mean I am suddenly a billionaire (very far from it!) - and yes, we still need everyone to <a href="#/portal/signup">click here to become supporting subscribers</a>.</strong></p>
<p>That said, this is an exciting project, and it happens to be my second foray into the world of movies and TV — my first was becoming the class clown character on ABC’s The Goldbergs (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZ2R3f3bA0">watch this clip for a good laugh</a>).</p>
<p>In this new project, I’m getting to work with Adam McKay, who is one of my personal heroes. You probably know his work — he directed some of my favorite films of all time, including <em>Anchorman, The Big Short</em> and <em>Vice</em>. He is a true visionary.</p>
<p>I don’t want to say anything more about the new film — but keep your eye out for it on Netflix. For obvious reasons, the pandemic has made it tough to know an exact release date, but filming is beginning, and I’m really proud to be a part of this project.</p>
<p>You can read more about the film in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leonardo-dicaprio-meryl-streep-join-jennifer-lawrence-in-adam-mckays-dont-look-up">The Hollywood Reporter</a> — and you can <a href="http://davidsirota.com/podcast/adam-mckay-on-trump-mr-t-his-new-dick-cheney-movie/">click here</a> to listen to this 2017 podcast I did with McKay about the current political era we are living in.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
