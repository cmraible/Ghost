<p><strong>• <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/binghamton/politics/2021/03/05/state-assembly--senate-pile-up-bills-aimed-at-nursing-home-accountability"><strong>New York Assembly Repeals Nursing Home Immunity </strong></a></strong>(Spectrum News) — <em>The New York Assembly passed a bill to repeal a law granting legal immunity to nursing homes, which was slipped into last year’s budget by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and is <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1365334764794781699?s=20"><em>at the center</em></a> of New York’s current nursing home scandal. Now, the repeal legislation is before the state senate.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/04/andrew-cuomo-impeachment-harassment/"><strong>Socialist Legislators Want To Impeach Cuomo for Abuses of Power</strong></a></strong> (The Intercept) — “<em>Whether or not the tall order of impeachment succeeds, the effort to hold Cuomo accountable should be seen in the context of a burgeoning shift in New York politics. The rising left-wing politicians aim to challenge the state’s entrenched corporate, carceral, and propertied power structures, where gender-based and racial abuses flourish.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/3/22309123/house-democrats-pass-voting-rights-bill-hr1"><strong>House Democrats Pass Democracy Reform Bill</strong></a></strong> (Vox) — <em>The House of Representatives passed The For The People Act this week, the second time it has approved the legislation. The act includes national automatic voter registration, protections against partisan gerrymandering, and other democracy reform measures. The Senate most likely <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/04/hr1-voting-reform-for-the-people-house/"><em>needs to end</em></a> the filibuster to pass the bill.</em></p>

Years of budget cuts — driven by Republicans over the agency’s extra scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status — have forced the IRS to scale back its workforce by tens of thousands of employees. At the same time, the IRS’s responsibilities have increased. But there has been a shift recently, with both Democrat and Republican lawmakers signaling they will consider more money for the IRS in the next funding cycle.”</em></p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/01/biden-amazon-union-video-472315"><strong>President Joe Biden Backs Amazon Workers’ Union Drive</strong></a></strong>(Politico) — <em>“Biden’s decision to wade in publicly on behalf of a unionization push, particularly at a time when private-sector organizing faces difficulty in holding it’s ranks, marked a major shift in how presidential administrations have addressed labor politics.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://twitter.com/SenGianaris/status/1367850567423455236?s=20"><strong>Top New York Democrat Wants To Tax The Rich</strong></a></strong> —<em> A coalition of organizations in New York have put together a <a href="https://investinourny.org/"><em>package of reforms</em></a> that would raise taxes on the richest people in their state and raise $50 billion for investments in public services. Today, activists <a href="https://twitter.com/nychange/status/1367865368983842816?s=20"><em>shut down</em></a> two bridges in New York City to attract attention to the issue. Their tactics seem to be working: The state’s number-two ranking senator <a href="https://twitter.com/SenGianaris/status/1367850567423455236"><em>announced his support</em></a> for the reforms on Friday.</em></p>

<h4 id="reader-comment-of-the-week"><strong>READER COMMENT OF THE WEEK:</strong></h4>
<p>“We did not elect a Parliamentarian to overrule an elected body over a bill as important as raising the minimum wage. The Biden/Harris team thus far is letting the public down by not addressing the need to abolish the Filibuster, not working to bring about the $15 minimum wage and not being more forthright in their bombing of Syria. Time is wasting, voters are impatient and if not now, when? Democrats in the White House, Senate, and House? You have it, now use it.” — Vi Mooberry, in response to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/house-dems-demand-harris-advance/">“House Dems Demand Harris Advance $15 Minimum Wage”</a></p>
<h4 id="take-action"><strong>TAKE ACTION:</strong></h4>
<p>These Democratic Senators cast votes against raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour today — as did every Republican in the Senate:</p>
