<p>Good things are happening! A new poll suggests Americans feel more positive about unions (and more negative about big business) than any point in half a century. It likely helps that around the country, labor continues to score victories, such as how the largest healthcare workers union in Connecticut stared down the state’s governor and won itself a major raise. Meanwhile, as Democrats slowly become more critical of the Israeli occupation of Palestine, the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is flourishing and needs all the support it can get.</p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/13/americans-are-more-pro-union-and-anti-big-business-than-at-any-time-in-decades"><strong>Americans Are More Pro-Union — And Anti-Big Business — Than At Any Time In Decades</strong></a>: “Today, public feeling toward labor is more positive, and public feeling toward big business more negative, than at any time in five decades. What’s more, workers increasingly want to be in unions: over half of Americans say they would vote for a union at work, while only 11 percent of US employees currently belong to one — largely because labor laws remain stacked in favor of big business. Americans’ rising affinity for organized labor and antipathy toward big business opens up new possibilities for a more balanced economy and society — but not without reform to the labor laws that hold workers back,” write Emily DiVito and Aaron Sojourner for <em>The Guardian.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://prospect.org/environment/vineyard-wind-blows-in/"><strong>Interior Department Approves Massive Offshore Wind Project</strong></a><strong>: </strong>“This week, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approved an 800-megawatt, $2.8 billion wind energy project in Massachusetts waters south of Martha’s Vineyard. The project, named Vineyard Wind, is the first utility-scale offshore proposal to clear federal regulatory hurdles. While it’s a big step in the direction of the 30 gigawatts of installed wind power that President Biden wants to see up and running by 2030, its long-in-coming approval is a stark reminder of the consequences of delays and missed opportunities in America’s race against climate change.”</p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162377/giving-up-economic-growth-green-climate"><strong>Giving Up on Economic Growth Could Make Us Cooler and Happier</strong></a>: In order to stop the climate crisis, Kate Aronoff writes we need to give up on the political and economic principle that the economy will continue to grow. Giving up on that idea — or pursuing “degrowth” — isn’t just necessary to save the climate, notes Aronoff, but also means that we will be able to work less and have more time for leisure.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/josheidelson/status/1393265201135296512?s=20"><strong>Amazon Caught Red-Handed</strong></a><strong>: </strong>An Amazon worker testified before the National Labor Relations Board today that the company had the keys to the mailbox that workers were using to submit ballots for the union election. If the testimony is found to be credible, it could be enough to overturn the results of the union election, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2021/05/13/lamont-sweetens-his-best-and-final-offer-to-avert-nursing-home-strike/"><strong>Connecticut Nursing Home Workers Threaten Strike, Win Raise</strong></a>: </strong>This week, the largest health care workers union in Connecticut, the SEIU District 1199 New England, threatened to strike at dozens of nursing homes. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont responded by <a href="https://twitter.com/JonahFurman/status/1392298568808083458?s=20">calling in the National Guard</a> to bust the strike, but the union reached a deal with Lamont before the strike was set to start. The SEIU 1199 won greater state investment in nursing homes, as well as raises to at least $20 per hour for most workers and better benefits.</p>

Democratic lawmakers took to the floor of Congress to condemn the Israeli occupation. “The pro-Palestinian speeches — and a series of other statements, bills, and other efforts to shape policy — reflect a growing sympathy for the Palestinian cause among Americans in general, and Democrats in particular, that is finally manifesting on Capitol Hill,” noted <em>HuffPost</em>.</p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/technology/state-privacy-internet-laws.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><strong>As Congress Dithers, States Step In to Set Rules for the Internet</strong></a>:</strong> “News outlets in Florida may soon be able to sue Facebook and Twitter if the social media companies take down their content. Arkansans shopping on Amazon will be able to see contact information for third-party merchants, which the site won’t be required to show people outside the state. Residents of Virginia can ask Google and Facebook not to sell their personal data, and the state can sue the companies if they don’t comply. Over the past six months, Virginia, Arkansas, Florida and Maryland have been among at least 38 states that have introduced more than 100 bills to protect people’s data privacy, regulate speech policies and encourage tech competition, according to a tally by <em>The New York Times</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/palestinian-resitance-hope/"><strong>Palestinian Solidarity Means Boycotts, Divestments, and Sanctions</strong></a>: </strong>“A particularly important source of Palestinian hope is the growing impact of the Palestinian-led nonviolent BDS movement, which aims at ending Israel’s regime of military occupation, settler-colonialism, and apartheid and defending the right of Palestinian refugees to return home,” writes Omar Barghouti in <em>The Nation.</em> “The main contribution of the BDS movement to Palestinian liberation, however, is its role in decolonizing Palestinian minds from deeply seated powerlessness, and in leading a radical praxis of globalized, intersectional resistance, transformation, and emancipation. Today, more than ever, Palestinians are telling the world that true solidarity with our struggle for freedom, justice, and equality spells BDS. We are shattering our wall of fear everyday, and we need not just ‘some more courage,’ as my relative from Acre said, but an eruption of meaningful solidarity that ends all complicity in Israel’s oppression.”</p>
