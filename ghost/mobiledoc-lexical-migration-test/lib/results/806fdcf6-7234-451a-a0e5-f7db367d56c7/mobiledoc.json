Educate the people on the waste of the F-35, or the billions being spent on NEW nuclear weapons –– as if we need more than one to obliterate life. Maybe this is one way to get people involved, demanding that the good parts of this bill become permanent by educating them on how much waste is ignored in things that don't work and destroy lives for no reason with the wars of aggression we engage in.
