<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Last week, we were the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/primary-schumer-to-guarantee-opposition/">first</a> to publish a report on how congressional Democrats could try to stop a Trump Supreme Court pick. While others have thrown up their hands and surrendered, we have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/aoc-to-schumer-we-must-use-every/">continued</a> that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-new-supreme-court-could-forever/">reporting</a> all <a href="__GHOST_URL__/capitulation-will-not-halt-trumps/">week</a>. Now, there are now signs that the message is starting to break through in a big way, so we are trying to expand our coverage as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>To do that, we need as many free subscribers to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to pitch in and become supporting subscribers.</strong></p>
<p>Look at what’s happened in the last week: amid the drumbeat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has gone from preemptive surrender to actually <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/517610-democrats-step-up-hardball-tactics-as-supreme-court-fight-heats-up">invoking</a> some rules to try to slow down the process. After we were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/09/24/memo-laying-out-delay-tactics-circulates-among-senate-democrats/">credited</a> for breaking <a href="__GHOST_URL__/memo-suggests-tactics-for-dems-to/">this big story last night</a>, Republican senators are this morning saying they are <a href="https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1309530268693417987?s=20">concerned</a> they may have to stay in Washington, off the campaign trail because they may have a battle on their hands.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where this is all going — but one takeaway here is that the pressure on Democrats to fight is having an effect. So <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsegalri/status/1307715822249480193?s=21"><em>keep making those calls</em></a>.</p>
<p>Another takeaway is that accountability journalism works. As a grassroots-funded media outlet, we are doing the kind of reporting that the corporate-owned media refuses to do — and it is having real results. Obviously, our work is not the only thing that’s helping — but clearly it is a factor.</p>
<p><strong>We want to do as much hard-hitting coverage of the Supreme Court fight and the 2020 election as possible. We want to hire more reporters to expand our accountability journalism.
