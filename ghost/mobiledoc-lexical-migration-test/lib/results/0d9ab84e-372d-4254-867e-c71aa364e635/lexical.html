<p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1383045657511014401?s=21"><strong>A Senate Holdout Now Backs The PRO Act</strong></a>: Maine Independent Sen. Angus King had previously refused to support landmark legislation to make it easier for workers to join unions. But as a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-grassroots-battle-to-change-americas?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=facebook">coalition of unions and DSA</a> have intensified their grassroots campaign for the bill, King has now <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1383045657511014401?s=21">signed on</a> as a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/420/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded">co-sponsor</a>.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-calls-salt-deduction-a-gift-to-billionaires-2021-4"><strong>AOC Slams Dems’ ‘Gift To Billionaires’</strong></a>: U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was <a href="https://twitter.com/joanegreve/status/1382770536669909003?s=20">one of only two Democratic lawmakers</a> from New York who courageously refused to sign a letter threatening to take down President Biden’s infrastructure and tax bill unless it includes a repeal of the federal cap on state and local tax deductions. "I think it's just a giveaway to the rich," she said, "and I think it's a gift to billionaires." Notably, the Democratic lawmakers are not merely pushing to raise the so-called SALT cap, but instead they want to fully repeal it — which means AOC’s statements are absolutely correct. The progressive-leaning <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/repealing-salt-cap-would-be-regressive-and-proposed-offset-would-use-up-needed">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> has reported that “the top 1 percent of households would receive 56 percent of the benefit of repeal, and the top 5 percent of households would receive over 80 percent of the benefit.”</p>
<p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/TaxNotes/status/1380546908998017026?s=20"><strong>IRS Budget Could Finally Get A Boost</strong></a>: <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-irs-is-letting-rich-people-fleece/">reporting</a> on how IRS budget cuts over many years have reduced audits of the super-rich and corporations, helping create a huge gap between taxes owed and taxes paid. Now, the Biden administration is <a href="https://twitter.com/TaxNotes/status/1380546908998017026?s=20">proposing</a> a big increase in the IRS enforcement budget.</p>

<p>• <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/at-will-just-cause-employment-union-labor-illinois"><strong>Lawmakers Take Aim At ‘At-Will’ Employment</strong></a>: <em>In These Times</em> reports that “a group of worker centers, unions, community groups and policy organizations in Illinois officially formed a new <a href="https://twitter.com/stablejobsnow">coalition</a>, Stable Jobs Now, that aims to dramatically shift the power balance between workers and bosses by eliminating ​’at-will’ employment — the practice that allows employers to fire their employees on a whim… The <a href="https://twitter.com/stablejobsnow">Stable Jobs Now</a> coalition is pushing for passage of the Secure Jobs Act, a bill recently introduced in both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly. The legislation would make Illinois the second state to adopt a just cause system. Only <a href="https://www.workplacefairness.org/blog/2013/01/22/just-cause-isnt-it-time-for-all-workers-to-have-some-job-security/">Montana</a> currently restricts at-will employment, a law dating back to 1987.”</p>

Asserting its rights as a “downstream state” under the Clean Water Act, the Fond du Lac Band filed a federal lawsuit in 2019 against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Army Corps of Engineers responded by issuing a decision temporarily halting wetlands permits the agency previously provided to the Polymet Mining Corporation that had allowed it to move ahead with the mine project.”</p>
