          "After running in ad campaign in West Virginia to push Manchin to support stimulus checks and ending the filibuster, the No Excuses PAC is launching a second ad campaign in Arizona, this time to push Sen. Kyrsten Sinema to commit to ending the filibuster. “While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with its six-year terms, is more sheltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping this strategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be.”"
