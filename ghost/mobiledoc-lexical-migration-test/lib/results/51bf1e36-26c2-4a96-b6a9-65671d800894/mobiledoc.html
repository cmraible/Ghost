<p>"You try buying insurance off of Obamacare," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/becoming-aoc-cover-story-2020">told Vanity Fair in October</a>, noting that she was paying $200-per-month as a bartender for a health insurance plan that came with the "privilege" of an $8,000 deductible.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s COVID relief proposal asks Congress to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-biden-lifts-health-care-plan/">pay billions to insurers</a> to put millions more Americans on plans like these, which many won’t be able to use — instead of creating a promised public health insurance option or expanding existing government health care programs.</p>

<p>Natural disasters caused <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-catastrophes-report-idUSKBN29U003">nearly</a> $100 billion in insurance losses in 2020, 40 percent above average for this century.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-flashback-"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>On January 4, Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-shift-shows-pressure-can-work/">promised</a> in Georgia: “By electing Jon and the reverend, you can make an immediate difference in your own lives — the lives of the people all across this country — because their election will put an end to the block in Washington on that $2,000 stimulus check; that money that will go out the door immediately to help people who are in real trouble."</p>
<p>Now, Biden is only demanding new $1,400 survival checks, and lawmakers are <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1351903264548261890">predicting</a> they won’t be able to pass a COVID relief deal until March.</p>

The Tesla options could be a jackpot, since the stock is up more than 200 points since he first made the transaction.
