<p>On Wednesday 2/17 at 7pm ET (4pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> supporting subscribers will talk to acclaimed writer, activist, and scholar Noam Chomsky about the rise of authoritarianism in America and his argument that Trumpism is an outgrowth of the Democrats abandoning the working class.</p>
<p>Chomsky has a new book out called <em>Chomsky For Activists, </em>which chronicles his decades of protesting and what lessons can be learned in the current era.</p>
