<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We are building a grassroots-funded media outlet that follows the money and challenges power — and we broke a series of big stories this week. As <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/amy-coney-barretts-climate-denial-and-anti-abortion-vie-1845381598">Gizmodo</a> noted, Judge Amy Barrett could “end up being a deciding vote on a case involving Shell and cities seeking money to pay climate change-fueled damages, <em><strong>according to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/upcoming-scotus-climate-case-involves/">original reporting</a> from The Daily Poster.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>This is the kind of hard-hitting reporting we do everyday — <em><strong>and we can do more with <a href="#/portal/signup">your help</a></strong></em>. We are right now aiming to hire more journalists to try to build out a whole newsroom of reporters to hold politicians accountable — during this election and afterward.</p>

<p>If all of our free subscribers receiving this email become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber, we would have the resources to have a full newsroom of reporters to follow the money and scrutinize power. We’re already doing that and having big impact — but we could be doing so much more.</p>
<p>Media funded by billionaires and corporations will never consistently hold power accountable. That’s why we are building this grassroots-funded media outlet.</p>
