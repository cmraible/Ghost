<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week, our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-proposal-would-retroactively/">reporting</a> exposed the details of a bipartisan plan to give corporate executives legal immunity when they kill workers, and our Medicare for All reporting was <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1338532259100553218?s=20">touted by AOC</a> and other progressives. At one point, some Washington reporters actually expressed anger at us for scooping them.</p>
<p>Our work holding both parties accountable <a href="https://bluetent.us/arenas/media-message/david-sirota-s-daily-poster-wants-to-end-the-scourge-of-brun/">just got written up in a big profile here</a> — and we don’t care if we’re making powerful people angry. We’re proud that our small team is breaking big stories and we know we need to get ready for these battles to be even more intense in 2021. And here’s the good news: we are very close to having the resources to expand our team of journalists aggressively exposing corruption.</p>
<p><strong>But to do that, we need about 50 more free subscribers to become supporting subscribers RIGHT NOW to make it happen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please - <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to become a supporting subscriber</strong></a>, and forward this email to everyone you know asking them to subscribe.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>When you subscribe, you aren’t just helping support journalism - you get access to our live events (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-friday-1218-briahna/">like this one tonight!</a>), and you get our exclusive content, including the very popular Midday Poster. And we’re planning to expand these subscriber-only offerings in the new year.</p>
<p><strong>I hate asking people for resources - I’d rather be spending all my time doing the reporting we do. But I wouldn’t ask you to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to subscribe</strong></a> if it wasn’t important. We don’t rely on corporations or billionaires for funding - we are grassroots-funded which means we need as many people as possible to pitch in.</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 8 months, we’ve built a news organization from scratch, and it is making a huge impact. With your help, we can expand to make even more impact in 2021.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
