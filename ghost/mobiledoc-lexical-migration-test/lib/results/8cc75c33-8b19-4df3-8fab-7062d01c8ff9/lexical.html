<p>This week’s Weekend Reader includes a look at the Democratic Party’s climate denial, from President Joe Biden to former President Barack Obama, to Congress, who say they believe in science but keep backing continued fossil fuel development.</p>
<p>As <em>The New Republic</em> writes, Democrats “don’t dispute that the climate is changing, but they are absolutely in denial about what curbing it would entail.” Biden and lawmakers need to start working to decarbonize the planet while we still have time left, when we can still mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>That and more in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/andrew-cuomos-war-against-a-federal-prosecutor"><strong>Andrew Cuomo’s War Against a Federal Prosecutor</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“In April, 2014, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo placed a call to the White House and reached Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. Cuomo was, as one official put it, ‘ranting and raving.’ He had announced that he was shuttering the Moreland Commission, a group that he had convened less than a year earlier to root out corruption in New York politics. After Cuomo ended the group’s inquiries, Preet Bharara, then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued letters instructing commissioners to preserve documents and had investigators from his office interview key witnesses. On the phone with Jarrett, Cuomo railed against Bharara. ‘This guy’s out of control,’ a member of the White House legal team briefed on the call that day recalled Cuomo telling Jarrett. ‘He’s your guy.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Heritage-is-not-to-blame-Andrew-16370830.php?fbclid=IwAR2qIEvgKOg25SjXkY56f88lkKFazKAQEMMlvk96dM6qMrMBlqylJZugFj8"><strong>Heritage Is Not To Blame, Andrew</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Times Union) — <em>“When he lamely claimed that he was so affectionate because of his ‘generational and cultural perspectives,’ as an older Italian-American male, I went ballistic. He was gaslighting the public on the ‘toxic’ workplace culture he alone created, blaming it instead on his own Italian-American culture. No, Andrew, our loving, humanitarian Italian-American culture didn’t make you do it. You did. And it is despicable.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163205/playing-nice-fossil-fuel-industry-climate-denial"><strong>Playing Nice With the Fossil Fuel Industry Is Climate Denial</strong></a> (The New Republic) — <em>“The Biden administration is now on track to approve more oil and gas drilling on public lands — activity that accounts for a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — than any administration since George W. Bush. Climate envoy John Kerry has balked at the idea of committing the U.S. to a coal phaseout. Politicians who call themselves climate hawks are still going out of their way to make clear that there’s a vibrant future ahead for the companies that funded climate denial, whose business model remains built around burning up and extracting as many fossil fuels as possible. Administration officials, meanwhile, have talked repeatedly about the need to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is climate denial. These politicians don’t dispute that the climate is changing, but they are absolutely in denial about what curbing it would entail.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://features.propublica.org/wrong-goodbye/mistaken-identity-end-of-life-decision-family-support-frederick-williams-raheme-perry"><strong>The Wrong Goodbye</strong></a><strong></strong>(ProPublica) — <em>“It took only about five minutes without the respirator for the [Frederick Williams] to die, Ralph said. ‘We were crying,” Ralph remembered. “We prayed and everything. After they pulled the breathing apparatus and all that out, he tried to stay for a little while, but he was gone. That was it.’ Except it wasn’t. The patient they’d just had taken off life support was not Frederick Williams.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/delta-has-changed-pandemic-endgame/619726/"><strong>How The Pandemic Now Ends</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“The U.S. now faces a dispiriting dilemma. Last year, many people were content to buy time for vaccines to be developed and deployed. But vaccines are now here, uptake has plateaued, and the first surge of the vaccine era is ongoing. What, now, is the point of masking, distancing, and other precautions? The answer, as before, is to buy time — for protecting hospitals, keeping schools open, reaching unvaccinated people, and more. Most people will meet the virus eventually; we want to ensure that as many people as possible do so with two doses of vaccine in them, and that everyone else does so over as much time as possible. The pandemic isn’t over, but it will be: The goal is still to reach the endgame with as little damage, death, and disability as possible.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://walterkirn.substack.com/p/the-bullshit"><strong>The Bullshit</strong></a> (Unbound) — <em>“Every morning, there it is, waiting for me on my phone. The bullshit. It resembles, in its use of phrases such as “knowledgeable sources” and “experts differ,” what I used to think of as the news, but it isn’t the news and it hasn’t been for ages. It consists of its decomposed remains in a news-shaped coffin. It does impart information, strictly speaking, but not always information about our world. Or not good information, because it’s so often wrong, particularly on matters of great import and invariably to the advantage of the same interests, which suggests it should be presumed wrong as a rule. The information it imparts, if one bothers to sift through it, is information about itself; about the purposes, beliefs, and loyalties of those who produce it: the informing class. They’re not the ruling class — not quite — but often they’re married to it or share therapists or drink with it at Yale Bowl football games.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/16/the-lost-canyon-under-lake-powell"><strong>The Lost Canyon Under Lake Powell</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>“In June, Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox, announced that the state was so short of water that the only thing that could help would be ‘divine intervention.’ He asked citizens of all faiths to join him in praying for precipitation. “We need more rain and we need it now,” he said. Climate change is making such intercession more difficult. As temperatures rise, it takes more rain (or snow) to produce the same amount of runoff. Combined with chronic overuse of the Colorado River, drought and warming have reduced [Lake] Powell to a puddle of its former self. Since 2000, the lake’s surface has dropped by a hundred and forty feet. Just in the past year, it’s dropped by fifty feet. As a result, Glen Canyon is beginning to emerge, again, into the light.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/magazine/indonesia-rainforest-coffee.html"><strong>How Your Cup of Coffee Is Clearing the Jungle</strong></a> (New York Times Magazine) — <em>“What they identified instead was a definitive cause of the forest’s disappearance: hundreds of small coffee farms, cleared an acre at a time from within the park’s boundaries. From certain vantages, the rows of coffee stretched as far as you could see. Such a problem might appear to be a simple one. People were growing coffee in a place where everyone seemed to agree they shouldn’t be. The forest was already well recognized as important, worth saving, formally protected. How hard could it really be, then, to do something about this? As with the satellite maps of the forest he’d just seen, Leggett was determined to keep widening the perspective, pulling back the camera until he could see the full picture.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster"><strong>A Message From <em>The Daily Poster</em>:</strong></h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This is <em>Daily Poster</em> reporter Julia Rock, with a special message. On Monday, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its latest report on the status of climate science. You’ve probably seen stories about the report’s key findings: Climate change is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/climate-crisis-unequivocally-caused-by-human-activities-says-ipcc-report">unequivocally caused</a> by the burning of fossil fuels, the rich nations of the Global North are <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/climate-change-wealthy-western-nations-global-north-south-fires-west">responsible for the vast majority</a> of emissions, and we are already locked in to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html">at least 1.5 degrees</a> of warming.</p>
<p>But that dire news shouldn’t overshadow another key message of the report: Rapid decarbonization can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. In other words, a better world is still possible.</p>
<p>As <em>The Daily Poster</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/that-was-me-people/">reported this week</a>, part of the way we get there is acknowledging what brought us to this point in the first place. There’s a lesson to be learned from the Obama years that can provide a roadmap for how to win a better world under Biden. Electing Democrats — even Democrats who “believe science” or tweet about the dire warnings of the IPCC report — isn’t going to be enough. As <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163205/playing-nice-fossil-fuel-industry-climate-denial">you read above</a>, Biden’s climate denial may look different than Trump’s, but it’s still climate denial.</p>
<p>That’s why you won’t see us cheering on politicians who brag about increasing oil production, or ignoring Democratic Senators <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-budget-vote-suggests-were-fracked/">who vote with</a> their GOP allies to save fracking.</p>
<p>The IPCC issued a warning this week, but more importantly, it demanded a call to action. <em>The Daily Poster</em> will continue producing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-boosted-a-pipeline-now-his-aide-could-reap-a-windfall/">accountability</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-is-ignoring-an-easy-climate-victory/">journalism</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/climate-fight-brewing-in-brussels/">on</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/dirty-marketing/">the</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-weak-pause-on-drilling-permits/">climate</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/chevrons-prisoner/">crisis</a>, because the alternative would be letting the fossil fuel industry commit ecocide. And we believe that a better world is still possible.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Julia</p>
