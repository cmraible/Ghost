<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Late last night, something rare and amazing happened: We won.</p>
<p>That’s right, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was shamed into <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-nursing-homes-cuomo-covid-immunity-20210407-li3aals3dvfldld5d4ifuaypoa-story.html">repealing</a> the corrupt corporate immunity law that the <em>The Daily Poster </em>first exposed with our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">investigative reporting series</a> into the tragic nursing home disaster.</p>
<p><strong>One New York lawmaker made it plain, <a href="https://twitter.com/Biaggi4NY/status/1379686940451209219"><strong>declaring</strong></a>: “So much of why it happened is because of your reporting that blew the top off of it all.”</strong></p>
