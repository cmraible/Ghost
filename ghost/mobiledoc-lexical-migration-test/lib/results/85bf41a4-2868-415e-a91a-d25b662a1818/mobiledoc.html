<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We are officially one month into this newsletter project — and I wanted to thank everyone for reading and for giving us such helpful feedback. We have been breaking important stories about the economy, corruption and corporate power, and we will soon have some exciting news about expansion plans.  In the meantime, I have a request:</p>
<p><strong>Can you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a paying subscriber to help us expand?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to our initial supporting subscribers, we’ve been able to bring on money-in-politics reporter Andrew Perez, who is reporting out some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/democrats-are-now-retreating-on-a">really</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/these-companies-worked-to-shape-paid">crucial news</a> about the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. With your help, we can build out this reporting even more — and in ways that can have a bigger impact.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing: if you become a supporting subscriber, you’ll not only be supporting hard-hitting reporting, you’ll also get some exclusive content like our popular weekly must-reads and quick clicks (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/tmi-weekly-quick-clicks-and-must-719">here’s an example</a>).</p>
<p>I realize that we’re living through a brutal economy and that resources are scarce. But if you want to change the media and support a new grassroots-funded model of journalism, I hope you’ll consider <a href="#/portal/signup">becoming a supporting subscriber</a> — and encouraging anyone else you know to also become a subscriber.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request — and for your support.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
