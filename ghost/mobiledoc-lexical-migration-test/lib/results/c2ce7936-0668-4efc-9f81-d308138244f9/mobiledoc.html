<p>Really sorry for the second email today — some of our subscribers said they had trouble viewing <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> new video holding politicians accountable for not passing $2,000 checks.</p>
<p>If you want to watch the video we mentioned in our last email to you, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1364323304257908736?s=20">please click here to view it</a>.</strong></p>
