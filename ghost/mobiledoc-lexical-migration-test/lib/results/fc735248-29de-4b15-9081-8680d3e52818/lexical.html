<p>“Nobody’s going to persuade me that somehow, some way that CEOs in this country are bad people. [They] are creating jobs and they deserve a seat at the table.” — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/biden-administration-will-create-position-to-reach-conservatives?sref=Yt1f10Jr">Rep. Cedric Richmond</a>, D-La., a senior Biden advisor and incoming director of the White House’s Office of Public Engagement.</p>

<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>In 1994, Biden’s HHS nominee Xavier Becerra <a href="https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/1335788821582147589?s=21">endorsed a single-payer health care system</a> on the floor of the House of Representatives, calling health care a “right, not a privilege.”</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-action"><strong>TODAY’S ACTION:</strong></h4>
<p>The Department of Justice <a href="https://twitter.com/etammykim/status/1336409662925631489?s=20">has advised</a> Trump against executing Brandon Bernard, who has been on death row in Indiana for half his life. He is scheduled to be executed tomorrow unless Trump is stopped from carrying out his <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-final-cruelty-executing-prisoners">ninth execution since July</a>. Bernard’s defense team is asking that you <a href="https://www.helpsavebrandon.com/send-a-letter-to-president-trump">email President Trump</a> to demand he spare Bernard’s life.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MORE EVIDENCE THAT LINCOLN PROJECT WAS A GRIFT: </strong>Last month, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-real-story-about-never-trump/">we obtained data</a> from a political firm that showed what a failure the Lincoln Project’s ads were (and that some even swayed voters towards Trump). A top Democratic Party’s top super PAC did its own analysis, and found <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hottest-campaign-ads-on-twitter-didnt-really-work-study?ref=home">they didn’t sway voters all</a> (despite going viral on Twitter).</li>
    <li><strong>BLACKSTONE’S ELECTION INVESTMENTS PAYING OFF: </strong>Once again, Democratic Rep. Richard Neal is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/08/surprise-medical-billing-neal-covid/">blocking federal efforts</a> to stop health care providers from passing on large surprise medical bills to patients. Neal’s re-election campaign was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-hospitals-bankroll-the-democrat/">bankrolled</a> by Blackstone, a private equity firm that owns a hospital staffing company responsible for many surprise bills, as well as other lobbying groups that have opposed reforms to end the practice.</li>
    <li><strong>TRUMP ENTRENCHING ENVIRONMENTAL DEREGULATION: </strong>Trump is using his final days in office to entrench four years of work to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/trump-rushes-environmental-regulations-that-could-handcuff-biden?sref=Yt1f10Jr">dismantle environmental regulations</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/climate/arctic-refuge-lease-sales.html">open more land for drilling</a> and <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/trump-s-epa-throws-polluters-one-more-giant-toxic-bone-1845842250?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=earther">enable polluters</a>. Check out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html">this tracker</a> of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental protections.</li>
    <li><strong>ANTI-POVERTY TAX BREAK ENRICHES BILLIONAIRES: </strong>The Trump administration’s “opportunity” zone program was intended to increase investment in poor communities. But the biggest winners <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/business/tax-opportunity-zones.html">have been billionaires</a>, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-09/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-use-opportunity-zone-tax-breaks-for-private-space-race?sref=Yt1f10Jr">Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-a-tax-break-to-help-the-poor-went-to-nba-owner-dan-gilbert">and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert</a>, who have used the program to shield their assets from taxes by putting them in designated distressed communities. Some of Biden’s advisers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/biden-s-team-sees-promise-in-a-tax-break-championed-by-trump?sref=Yt1f10Jr">reportedly like the tax breaks</a>, and Biden has proposed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-biden-might-alter-tax-rules-from-nonprofits-to-opportunity-zones-11600426801">reform, not repeal</a>, of the program.</li>
