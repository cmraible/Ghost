<p>Friends:</p>
<p>If you’ve been reading this newsletter, you know we have been breaking open stories that are so often ignored by corporate media. We’re able to do that because we are 100% grassroots funded by subscribers. And now we’re trying to expand our work.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why I’m asking you to go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> and pitch in to become a supporting subscriber of this newsletter. Whether you become a $5 a month subscriber or an annual subscriber, every subscription helps.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been following our work, you know that we broke open the story of Andrew Cuomo granting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity">immunity</a> to nursing home executives after getting big campaign donations.</p>
<p>We broke open the story of the Trump administration <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-trump-just-fulfilled-his-billionaire">delivering</a> a huge gift to Wall Street after a Trump-boosting super PAC received a $3 million donation from a private equity billionaire.</p>
<p>We’ve been reporting on the protests against police violence, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/spending-on-police-is-out-of-control">out-of-control spending</a> on local police — and how Republicans <a href="__GHOST_URL__/republicans-defunded-the-police-we">defunded</a> the police we actually need.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-pennsylvania-gop-scandal-hidden-data-pandemic/">American Prospect</a> recently said that our reporting “typically dares to go into hidden corners to expose deceit, for which we should all be grateful.”</p>
<p>We have been able to do all of this and more because supporting subscribers have pitched in to help us.</p>
<p><strong>Please go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> to help us continue to expand.</strong></p>
<p>With your help we can change the media and build a sustainable model of journalism that scrutinizes power. The only way to do that is through grassroots funding.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
