<p>Good things are happening! House progressives say they’re ready to play hardball. Also, management at the New York Times accidentally showed its hand in a union-busting campaign, greedy landlords lose a legal battle, and one of the world’s biggest oil companies is finally being forced to pay for a spill. And did you hear? New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will be gone in a week!</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s You Love To See It below, exclusively for paid subscribers!</p><!--members-only-->

<p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/USProgressives/status/1425131542783963137?s=20"><strong>House Progressives Prepared To Wield Voting Power</strong></a><strong></strong>— <em>Members of the House Progressive Caucus </em>—<em> Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Katie Porter of California </em>—<em> declared that they won't vote for the bipartisan infrastructure package unless the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill also passes, a sign that they <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporate-dems-show-progressives/"><em>have learned a lesson</em></a> about how to use their voting power to extract progressive demands. Let’s hope they stick to the plan…</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/567753-federal-judge-rejects-effort-to-block-eviction-moratorium"><strong>Federal Court Upholds Eviction Moratorium</strong></a></strong>(The Hill) — <em>“A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected a request from a group of landlords to block the Biden administration’s renewed eviction moratorium. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee, leaves intact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) extended freeze on evictions, which is set to run until early October.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shell-has-to-pay-111-million-for-1970-oil-spill-that-t-1847473557"><strong>Shell Has to Pay $111 Million for 1970 Oil Spill</strong></a></strong> (Earther) — “<em>The settlement in this case alone will not make up for the decades of environmental justice communities have suffered due to the fossil fuel industry. But it is at least a welcome start.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cuomos-legacy-normalizing-corruption-and-lawlessness/"><strong>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Finally Resigns</strong></a></strong> (The Daily Poster) — <em>If you are reading this, you surely already know that Cuomo has put in his two weeks notice for his resignation as governor of New York. While <a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1425805283264286721?s=20"><em>resignation is not the same as facing accountability</em></a>, and the political culture that enabled Cuomo <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/cuomo-leaves-but-corrupt-political-culture-remains-in-new-york/"><em>remains in place</em></a>, there’s no denying that this is good news.

So it was likely a bit embarrassing when the law firm representing the paper’s management accidentally sent a private strategy memo to representatives for the newly unionized staff,” </em>The Daily Beast <em>reports.</em></p>
