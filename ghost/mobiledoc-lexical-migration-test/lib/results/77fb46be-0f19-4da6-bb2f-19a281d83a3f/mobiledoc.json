          "Republican operatives have set up a front group, the Coalition to Protect American Workers, to oppose President Joe Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike. According to reports, the group is planning to “spend at least $25 million on TV and digital ads and organizing” to fight the tax increase, ostensibly to protect jobs. But based on the past activities of the dark-money organization behind the effort, perhaps a better name for the group would be the Coalition to Infect American Workers."
