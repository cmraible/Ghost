<p>“Republicans could trip over their own shoelaces and they’d still find a way to blame me, immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, the Green New Deal, BLM, anything but accept responsibility for their own actions and dealings. Ineptitude, bigotry, and corruption. Disasters in their own right.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1362154790118162436?s=20">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a></p>

<p>According to The Lancet, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/02/lancet-study-40-percent-u-s-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-avoidable-unnecessary.html">40 percent</a> of U.S. COVID deaths were preventable and attributable to Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>While Texas’ energy officials have rightly pointed to fossil fuel shortages as responsible for the state’s blackouts, Gov. Greg Abbott has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/17/texas-abbott-wind-turbines-outages/">been</a> appearing on Fox News <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/">blaming</a> wind turbines and renewable energy for the state’s woes, even though as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/climate/texas-blackouts-disinformation.html">New York Times</a> notes, Texas’s “widespread electricity failure was largely caused by freezing natural gas pipelines” in a state where fossil fuels are “responsible for the majority of Texas’ power supply.”</p>
<p>Abbott’s goal is clear: he wants to use the disaster to pretend, in his words, that “the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America.”</p>
<p>Following the money offers one reason why Abbott is so determined to concoct such a ridiculous narrative and vilify the Green New Deal: he’s vacuumed in huge money from the fossil fuel industry he’s defending and that is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/">at the heart of the disaster</a>.</p>
<p>In all, Abbott raked in a whopping <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;law-eid=11281947&amp;d-cci=33">$28 million</a> from oil and gas industry donors during his political career, according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money In State Politics. That includes more than $11 million in his most recent reelection campaign. Donations include a <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/Two-1M-checks-for-Gov-Abbott-are-allowed-in-14099229.php">$1 million check</a> Abbott received from Midland Energy founder Syed Javaid Anwar, and <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;law-eid=11281947&amp;d-eid=2508929">$1.4 million</a> from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ray-lee-hunt/?sh=186e75f868a0">billionaire</a> oil magnate Ray Lee Hunt.</p>
<p>By contrast, Abbott has received just <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;law-eid=11281947&amp;d-ccb=101#[%7B1%7Cgro=d-id">$70,000</a> from donors in the wind and solar industries.</p>

<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>We are now four weeks into Joe Biden’s presidency, with Democrats still debating $15 minimum wage and COVID relief. In his first 100 days in office, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ushered <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fast-facts-on-the-first-100-days">15 major pieces of legislation</a> through Congress to address the Great Depression.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• MINIMUM WAGE, MAXIMUM MISINFORMATION: </strong>A few years ago, the Congressional Budget Office undermined its own credibility by <a href="https://grist.org/article/cbo-dismisses-costs-of-global-warming-posing-hurdle-for-climate-legislation/">downplaying</a> the catastrophic effects of climate change - now it is doubling down with a thinly sourced but widely cited report designed to sabotage the push for a minimum wage increase. Economist James Galbraith subjects the CBO report to some <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/james-k-galbraith-says-cbo-not-competent-to-assess-economics-of-minimum-wage">basic scrutiny</a> and shows that the CBO “should not have published this report, and no one should rely on it.”</p>
<p><strong>• U.S. ECONOMY WILL NOT ‘OVERHEAT’: </strong>Speaking of the CBO, economist Claudia Sahm <a href="https://twitter.com/Claudia_Sahm/status/1361306199208185858/photo/1">analyzed</a> separate CBO data and revealed that despite scaremongering about the U.S. economy, concerns about “overheating” are overblown. Sahm demonstrates that U.S. economic capacity has repeatedly been revised down over the years.</p>
<p><strong>• HARVARD STUDY FINDS SLAVERY REPARATIONS COULD HAVE MITIGATED COVID DEATHS: </strong>A new peer-reviewed <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/2/16/hms-reparations-impact-on-infections/">study</a> from Harvard has found that had the descendants of enslaved Black people received financial reparations before the pandemic, Covid-19 transmission in Louisiana would have decreased by as much as 68 percent.</p>
<p><strong>• FACEBOOK BLOCKS NEWS IN AUSTRALIA OVER GOVERNMENT PLAN TO FORCE PAYMENT TO PUBLISHERS: </strong>The social media giant <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/17/968723929/facebook-blocks-news-in-australia-over-government-plan-to-force-payment-to-publi">announced</a> Wednesday that it is blocking users in Australia from accessing news stories on its platform. It is also blocking users everywhere from accessing Australian news sources. The move is a response to proposed legislation to require social media companies to pay Australian news outlets posted on its site.</p>
