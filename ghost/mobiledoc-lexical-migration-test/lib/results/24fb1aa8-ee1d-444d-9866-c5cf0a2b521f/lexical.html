<p>“It’s the Keystone Cops version of the coup,” Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor, told <em>The Daily Poster</em> about the GOP’s effort to challenge <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/06/do-it-mike-trump-leans-on-pence-to-reject-bidens-electoral-college-certification-455319">certification</a> of the electoral college votes in Congress today. He added: “It’s terrifying, because you can see how they could have done it so much better. But no, they didn’t do it in any effective way.”</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SURVIVAL CHECK UPDATE: </strong>The $600 checks that were included in Congress’s coronavirus relief package are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-second-stimulus-payments-reach-household-bank-accounts-11609885984?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter">already reaching people</a>, unless you <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/your-stimulus-check-might-be-delayed-if-you-filed-your-n1252912?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma">filed</a> your taxes with an online tax preparer. Now the question is when Congress will pass $2,000 checks, and <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1346840520090333184?s=20">how they will do it</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>MANCHIN COULD BE A PROBLEM:</strong> Conservative Democrat Joe Manchin has reportedly been <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bernie-sanders-joe-manchin-reportedly-224000063.html">standing in the way</a> of larger survival checks and fighting with Bernie Sanders about the idea, even though <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/2019-median-household-income.html">nearly 70 percent</a> of his constituents make less than $75,000 a year. According to census data, nearly 13 percent of West Virginians are now suffering from food scarcity — and the number of people who say they often don’t have enough to eat has increased 70 percent during the pandemic.</li>
    <li><strong>A DAY ONE AGENDA FOR CONGRESS: </strong>Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff’s victories in Georgia will give the Congress the votes it needs to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/georgia-wins-would-empower-dems-to/">repeal some of the rules</a> that Trump has passed as a lame duck<strong>.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>DEMOCRACY REFORM: </strong>Democrats and Republicans now hold equal number of seats in the U.S. Senate, but the Democratic senators <a href="https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/1346834407626334209?s=20">represent 41.5 million more people</a> than the Republicans. That’s why key reforms like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/dc-statehood-house-vote.html">making D.C. a state</a> and abolishing the electoral college (which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-electoral-college-makes-it-easier/">makes it easier</a> to steal elections) should be top priorities for this Congress.</li>
    <li><strong>UNIONIZE: </strong>Union busting firms are doing what they do best: surveilling employees and calling them “lazy” and “aloof,” <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenKGurley/status/1346485991213699072?s=20">Vice reports.</a> As Trump proposes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/business/us-economy-coronavirus/a-new-labor-department-rule-would-classify-gig-workers-as-contractors">eleventh hour rules</a> to fleece workers, it’s more important than ever for the labor movement to fight not just for <a href="https://brandonmagner.substack.com/p/what-does-a-50-50-senate-mean-for?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNzI1NTkwLCJwb3N0X2lkIjozMTEwMjA3OCwiXyI6IlFlTy90IiwiaWF0IjoxNjA5OTUyNTE0LCJleHAiOjE2MDk5NTYxMTQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xNjE4NTUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.dbMiotdJcpCh5DvpqCM19ECHqFevf_9Nut25_97xnEQ">legislative reform</a>, but to <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/labor-movement-georgia-ossoff-warnock-unions">bring democracy to the workplace</a>.</li>
