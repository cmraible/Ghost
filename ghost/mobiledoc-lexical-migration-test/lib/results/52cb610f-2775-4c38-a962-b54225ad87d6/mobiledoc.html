<p>On <em>The Daily Poster’s</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/podcast-liberal-wonks-are-trying/"> new podcast this week</a>, Sirota and author Thomas Frank discuss the troll phase of Larry Summers career, and the Biden administration’s surprising rejection of his latest attempt to undermine the stimulus.</p>
<p>They discuss Democrats latest attempts to complicate the promised $2,000 checks — and how the behavior spotlights liberal wonks’ belief that any initiative must be bad just because it is simple.</p>
<p>They also take a look at how the Washington Post is weaponizing “fact checking” and Pinocchios to inject extremist economic ideology into the political discourse.</p>
<p>And they review the insidious economic message of one of the the most talked about Super Bowl ads.</p>
