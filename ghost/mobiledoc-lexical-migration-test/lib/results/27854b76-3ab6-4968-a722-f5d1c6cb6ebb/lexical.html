<p><em>Hey everyone -- this is the first edition of a weekly dispatch of quick clicks, news items and must-reads. <strong>I’m doing it exclusively for paying subscribers, as a personal thank you for your support. </strong>I’m aiming to have one of these out every weekend. The idea is that in a content-soaked world, we can feel overwhelmed by too much information, so every week I want to give you some information that you may have missed in all the noise. I’ll aim to keep it succinct.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, email me and/or use the comments section in this post to give me any feedback about the newsletter, what you want to see etc. I want to hear from you directly.</em></p>
<p><em>Again, thanks so much for supporting this project -- as you may have seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnMU-4raF5E&amp;app=desktop"><em>some of the news coverage</em></a> this week, the first newsletter generated quite a buzz, so it feels like things are going well. Please encourage your friends to subscribe! - David</em></p>
