<p>During her Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Amy Coney Barrett depicted herself as an impartial legal arbiter whose personal views have no bearing on her court rulings. She made this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-silent-as-barrett-evades-climate/">argument</a> most explicitly when she insisted: “I don’t think that my views on global warming or climate change are relevant to the job I would do as a judge.”</p>
<p>This facile line may seem convincing — Vox’s climate writer David Roberts <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1316485992656695296?s=20">echoed</a> it, asserting that “ACB's views on climate change really don't matter” because what only really matters is her views of regulatory agencies’ legal authority.</p>
<p>That’s one helluva “well, actually” argument, but actually no: A past case tells a much different story. It illustrates exactly how justices’ personal views of climate science can determine what facts they accept — and do not accept — when they interpret the law.</p>
<p>Sure, Barrett spent the hearings touting her alleged objectivity, but her own answers about science illustrated deep and disqualifying bias.</p>
