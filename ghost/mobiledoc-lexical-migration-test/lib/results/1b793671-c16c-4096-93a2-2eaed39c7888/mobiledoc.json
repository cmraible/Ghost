At each live event, we will discuss the ramifications, messages and ideologies of classic political movies. Some of the films will be genuinely good, some will be so bad they’re good, but all of them will provide ample fodder for our incisive (read: pompous and long-winded) analysis. Along the way, we will have some very special guests join us for the fun."
