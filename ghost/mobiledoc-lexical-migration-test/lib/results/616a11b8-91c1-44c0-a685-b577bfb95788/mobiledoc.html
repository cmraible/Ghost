<p>Just a quick reminder that our subscriber-only Daily Poster anniversary celebration starts at 7pm ET (4pm PT) today (4/14).</p>
<p>My staff and I will be dishing on what it’s like to launch a grassroots news outlet, discussing lessons learned over the past year, and unveiling exciting plans for our future. There will also be lots of time for questions from attendees, as well as input on what kinds of stories people would like to see us cover.</p>
