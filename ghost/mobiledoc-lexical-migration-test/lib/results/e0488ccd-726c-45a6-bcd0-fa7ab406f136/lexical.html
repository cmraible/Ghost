<p>Friends:</p>
<p>One of the missions of this grassroots-funded journalism project is impact — we ask you to <a href="#/portal/signup">pitch in to become a supporting subscriber</a> so that we have the resources to report on corruption in a way that shames the political system into action.</p>
<p>And so with that in mind, I am thrilled to let you know some terrific news:</p>
<p><strong>After TMI’s investigative reporting series, <a href="https://nynow.wmht.org/blogs/health/ny-rolls-back-legal-protections-for-nursing-homes-health-care-facilities/"><strong>Gov. Andrew Cuomo has just signed legislation</strong></a> rolling back parts of New York’s corporate immunity law that we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity"><strong>shined a bright spotlight on</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>To know our journalism made a direct impact, just look at how Democratic Assemblyman Ron Kim publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1290456166234021895">lauded</a> TMI’s reporting for playing a pivotal role in forcing Cuomo to take action. Kim publicly credited “TMI’s relentless investigative journalism in uncovering NY’s blanket legal immunity for health care facilities.”</p>
<p>The reason I periodically ask you to <a href="#/portal/signup">pitch in and become a TMI supporting subscriber</a> is because we are trying to expand <em>exactly this kind of impact journalism</em>.</p>
<p><strong>So I’m going to ask you again: please go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> and become a monthly or annual supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for considering this request — with your help, we are building a new model for journalism that holds power accountable.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
