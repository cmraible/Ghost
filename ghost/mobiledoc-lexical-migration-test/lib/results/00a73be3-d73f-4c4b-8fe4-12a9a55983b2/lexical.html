<p>Charles Koch has been investing in residential real estate, so it’s not surprising that Koch-backed organizations have been fighting to end the federal COVID-19 eviction moratorium. The conservative billionaire appeared to get his wish this weekend, after Democrats allowed the eviction ban to expire.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, however, the Biden administration reversed course and announced a new eviction moratorium — so now conservative groups backed by Koch are hard at work attempting to stop the development.</p>

<p>As <em>The Daily Poster</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/koch-funded-eviction-push-while-buying-real-estate-stakes/">previously reported</a>, billionaire Charles Koch’s corporate empire has been plowing money into residential real estate since the COVID-19 pandemic started, while Koch-funded nonprofits have been pushing to end the federal eviction moratorium. </p>
<p>Democrats — after <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-scored-real-estate-cash-before-letting-eviction-ban-expire/">taking a cool million</a> from a real estate mogul — allowed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) eviction ban to expire last weekend, before the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/03/us/infrastructure-news-politics#evictions-housing-moratorium-pelosi-yellen">reversed course</a> and announced <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/Signed-CDC-Eviction-Order.pdf">a new moratorium</a> on Tuesday to protect renters in areas of the U.S. that are seeing a surge in COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>Two conservative groups backed by Koch that fought the original CDC policy are speaking out about the new moratorium now. </p>
<p>“Reissuing the CDC eviction moratorium is unlawful, irrational, &amp; will devastate mom-and-pop housing providers everywhere,” the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1422698089140326414">told the <em>Washington Post</em></a>. “NCLA will not stand for this. CDC never had legal authority to issue a nationwide eviction moratorium. Nothing has changed."</p>
<p>The Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) <a href="https://twitter.com/PacificLegal/status/1422690145535410179">tweeted</a>, “The eviction moratoria slapped down across the nation will only deepen the crisis that will live on long after the pandemic has passed.” The organization <a href="https://twitter.com/PacificLegal/status/1422701479094366208">added</a>: “With every effort at social engineering, we create new problems. And the cycle goes on as when one gives a mouse a cookie.” </p>
<p>The Charles Koch Foundation <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/480918408/201823199349104557/IRS990PF">gave</a><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20422379/2019-charles-koch-foundation-990.pdf">$2 million</a> to NCLA between 2017 and 2019, and $1.1 million to PLF. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>Two years into the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army was on the verge of defeat — thanks to smallpox. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/GW&amp;smallpoxinoculation.html">Ninety percent of soldier deaths</a> were due to the disease and other ailments. The surging virus was ravaging encampments, hindering troop movements, and hurting recruitment efforts. As General George Washington noted about smallpox in a letter, “we should have more to dread from [smallpox] than from the Sword of the Enemy.”</p>
<p>At the time, inoculating people with a less powerful form of smallpox was common in Europe and the British Army. But the Continental Congress, fearing the practice, banned the procedure among its troops. In February 1777, Washington decided to ignore the prohibition, writing to the governor of Virginia that the ban was “reprobated at this time, not only by the Consent and usage of [inoculations by] the greater part of the civilized World, but by our Interest and own experience of its utility.”</p>
<p>Washington then began history’s first mass inoculation campaign of an army in the middle of a war. The effort revitalized the Continental Army, spurred new recruitments, and is considered by some experts to be <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/people/ruma.chopra/courses/h174_MW_F11/s3/smallpox_GWarmy.pdf">one of the main reasons</a> the fledgling nation ended up winning its war for independence.</p>

    <li><strong>NINA TURNER LOSES OHIO RACE: </strong>Progressive icon Nina Turner <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/03/shontel-brown-beats-nina-turner-in-key-ohio-primary-502365">conceded defeat</a> Tuesday night to her establishment opponent Shontel Brown in the special primary election for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. In recent weeks, Brown has taken heat for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/house-candidate-shontel-brown-facing-potential-ethics-probe/">facing a potential ethics probe</a>, but she also scored high-profile endorsements from establishment power brokers like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.). Brown also far outpaced Turner in outside funding in the home stretch, netting <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmarans/status/1422732022737424387">more than $2.7 million</a> in from corporate interests like the Third Way think tank and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/03/shontel-brown-beats-nina-turner-in-key-ohio-primary-502365">pro-Israel super PAC</a> Democratic Majority for Israel. Early polling data suggested voter turnout was highest in <a href="https://twitter.com/briebriejoy/status/1422778703080304640">white, affluent parts</a> of the district. “We knew this would be an uphill battle from the moment we started this campaign,” Turner <a href="https://twitter.com/ninaturner/status/1422757294039764996">declared</a> in her concession speech. “While we didn’t cross the river, we inspired thousands to dream bigger and expect more.”</li>
    <li><strong>NEW YORK AG FINDS CUOMO GUILTY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT: </strong>On Tuesday, after a five-month investigation, the New York state attorney general’s office found New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/independent-investigators-find-governor-cuomo-sexually-harassed-multiple-women">sexually harassed 11 women</a> “by engaging in unwanted groping, kissing, and hugging, and making inappropriate comments.” Investigators also found that Cuomo fostered a toxic workplace and retaliated against one of the victims for blowing the whistle — and documents suggested CNN anchor Chris Cuomo <a href="https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1422595057354481667?s=21">helped</a> with his brother’s mid-scandal spin campaign. While the governor disputes the findings, the report spurred widespread calls for him to be impeached or resign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/03/nyregion/andrew-cuomo#biden-cuomo">including from President Joe Biden</a>. Cuomo is also facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/03/nyregion/andrew-cuomo?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage#cuomo-is-also-facing-investigations-into-nursing-home-deaths-and-his-book">several other investigations</a>, including a State Assembly investigation into his handling of COVID-19 nursing home deaths and how he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">worked to shield corporate executives</a> from liability for the carnage.</li>

    <li><strong>LABOR OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW AMAZON UNION VOTE: </strong>On Monday, a federal labor official found that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1014632356/amazon-alabama-warehouse-workers-may-get-to-vote-again-on-union">Amazon tampered with a failed union vote</a> this past spring at its Bessemer, Ala., warehouse, meaning workers there could get another chance to vote to form the company’s first unionized U.S. facility. Experts say the National Labor Relations Board is likely to approve the new vote, and while such union election do-overs often fail and labor organizers’ efforts could be hampered by high turnover at the Bessemer plant, activists say the decision would be a step in the right direction. As labor lawyer Brandon Magner noted in <a href="https://brandonmagner.substack.com/p/first-impressions-of-the-hearing">his analysis</a> of the development, “The agency desperately needs the monetary fines provision of the PRO Act currently included in the reconciliation bill being considered in Congress, but at least the Labor Board still seems able to tell a strike from a ball when calling a big game.”</li>
    <li><strong>PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM BUYS NONPROFITS’ SOFTWARE PLATFORMS: </strong>Apax Partners, a private equity firm, is purchasing and consolidating a trio of software companies serving nonprofits. The $2 billion deal will give Apax “a network of 650,000 non-profits, half the Fortune 500, and over 38 million donors and volunteers,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/apax-merges-software-firms-for-non-profits-in-2-billion-deal">reported <em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>.</em> As Democratic strategist Neal Kwatra <a href="https://twitter.com/nealkwatra/status/1422888642809409537?s=11">noted</a>, “Groups like Move On, Color of Change and NGP now have a PE firm with access to its data.”</li>
