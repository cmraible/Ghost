<p>This week’s Weekend Reader includes a look at the Democratic Party’s climate denial, from President Joe Biden, to former President Barack Obama, to Congress, who say they believe in science but keep backing continued fossil fuel development.</p>
<p>As <em>The New Republic</em> writes, Democrats “don’t dispute that the climate is changing, but they are absolutely in denial about what curbing it would entail.” Biden and lawmakers need to start working to decarbonize the planet while we still have time left, when we can still mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
