<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We’ve done something awesome — thanks to subscribers, we’ve been able to build this thing from scratch and bring aboard a team of reporters and contributors who are now breaking big stories every week. We’re very close to having the resources to expand our coverage for the final stretch of the election — but to do that we need as many free subscribers to become supporting subscribers. WE ARE SO CLOSE.</p>
<p><strong>Can you please go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> and become a supporting subscriber?</strong></p>
<p>To become a supporting subscribe, it’s $5 a month or $50 for the year — which I know is a lift, but it’s also a worth it. You not only get lots of subscriber-only content (which we are now expanding), you get ORIGINAL journalism that holds power accountable.</p>
<p>Look at what we’ve done just this week — we’ve broken a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/california-dems-give-up-on-new-oil">huge story</a> about Democrats capitulating to the fossil fuel industry, we unearthed lost history about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/flashback-ed-markeys-battles-with">Ed Markey</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/joe-kennedy-touted-commission-that">Joe Kennedy</a> in advance of the Massachusetts primary and we dove into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/study-college-football-is-feudalism">feudal system</a> of college sports.</p>
<p>What’s important here is that these stories would never have gotten out had we not had reporters digging them up. THAT is what you make possible when you become a supporting subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>Please, please, please — <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here and become a supporting subscriber</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>The corporate-owned media will never report these kinds of stories that challenge corporate power. The resources you pitch in will help us hire more reporters and contributors to expand this work that the corporate media will never do.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
