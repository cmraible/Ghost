Without a doubt, GM was always the leading force driving this innovation and Pontiac was great proof of that. Racing around with bright colors, massive powertrains, and some fantastic legends under their nameplate, Pontiac practically kicked off the whole thing. So it's understandable that their premium model, one that many consider the first of its kind, would be incredibly desirable on the classic automotive market.",
