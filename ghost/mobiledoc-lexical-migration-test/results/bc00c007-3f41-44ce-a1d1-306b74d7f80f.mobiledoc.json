The MG spent 30 years enjoying Southern California and occasional cruises before being shipped up to Washington where it was kept in a climate-controlled storage area. This car has been displayed at numerous car shows over its lifetime, and it remains a driver-quality show car."

Although this 1939 MG VA Tickford Drophead coupe is just a restoration from becoming a concours winner, it can be driven and enjoyed as it sits. Despite its long hood, this roadster is powered by a 1,548 cc four-cylinder engine and a four-speed manual transmission. The coolest part about the MG VA Tickford Drophead coupe is the convertible top, which can be set in three positions: fully closed, fully open and a removable portion above the front seats."
