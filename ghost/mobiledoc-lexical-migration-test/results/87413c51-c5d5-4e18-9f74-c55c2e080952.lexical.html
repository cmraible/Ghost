<hr>
<p>There's something so deeply satisfying about watching a car being washed, especially one with tons of grime that's transformed into a show car in front of our eyes. Now imagine the satisfaction in knowing that the car is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/look-on-in-horror-at-these-12-valuable-barn-find-cars/">coming back to life</a> after a long hibernation. The cars in this story are getting their extreme makeover after <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">sitting dormant for a long time</a>.</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-mercedes-280sl-detail-video/">After sitting neglected</a> in a garage for 37 years, the <a href="https://www.ammonyc.com/">Ammo NYC detail crew</a> was tasked with cleaning this 1969 Mercedes 280SL in preparation for a restoration. The cool part of this story is that it wasn't the owner of the car who commissioned the detail crew with rescuing the car; it was the owner's son. He did it as a surprise to his father who was the car's second owner after purchasing it in 1972. The Mercedes was used as a daily driver until 1982 when it was unceremoniously parked in the garage with more than 100,000 miles on the odometer.</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-1994-gmc-sierra/">Stored for two decades</a>, this Sierra wasn’t just caked in dirt like when you <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-a-jeep-wrangler-yj-get-a-deep-cleaning/">drive off-road for hours</a>. Once it was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1951-car-wash-beauty-pageant/">cleaned up</a> the oxidation in the paint was obvious, so Stauffer Garage polished it up to make the body look like it was new. That’s not some crazy black magic, we know, but it’s still great to see the process and end results.</p>

<p>Ammo NYC nearly broke the internet when it posted a video of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-bizzarrini-p538-barn-find-take-a-bath/">Bizzarini</a> tucked among an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">epic 300-car barn find collection</a> of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic cars</a>, and now the detailing company is back in the same warehouse to give a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1967-corvette-restored/">1967 Chevrolet Corvette</a> its first car wash in 33 years. The Corvette in question is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/big-block-1967-chevrolet-corvette-restored-to-factory-condition/">427 cubic-inch Sting Ray</a> coupe that seems to be in pretty good shape other than the dirt caked onto the paint and the interior covered in mold and mildew.</p>

<p>An undisclosed collector has stashed away over 300 rare vehicles in an undisclosed location. Once you see what all is in this facility, you’ll understand the desire for secrecy.
