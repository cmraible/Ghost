You can pretty much fit whatever engine or transmission combinations in the engine bay while still keeping a pretty unique look. Very rarely do you see custom builders utilizing the LT platform anymore but with recent innovations it’s becoming more of a reality. So how does this Nova use its LT power?"

Used in some of ham’s top dogs, it’s a quick and high revving engine with a supercharger an eight cylinders. This is all well and good but the six speed manual transmission makes it absolutely perfect for this car. "

Overall, this 650 horsepower beast is the perfect classic street build which is probably why GM was so avid about supplying the engine and transmission systems."
