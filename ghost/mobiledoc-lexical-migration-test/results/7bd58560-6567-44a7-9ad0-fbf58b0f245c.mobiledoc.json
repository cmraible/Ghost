In fact, the car has 80,000 miles on the odometer, which is surprising considering the cosmetic condition. Then the owner got busy, garaged it, then sold it to Tyler Hoover. Anyone who got a nice red muscle car for their graduation would want to baby the thing, even if it had an automatic like this Camaro does."

The engine turns over but won’t fire up until some starting fluid is sprayed in, leading them to conclude the fuel pump and tank are bad. Once the car’s on the lift a few leaks are obvious, but that’s not unexpected. What is a surprise are the frame stiffeners which have been welded in, increasing torsional rigidity for better handling, a very nice addition to a fourth-gen Camaro indeed. A few other mods are waiting, like slotted and drilled rotors."
