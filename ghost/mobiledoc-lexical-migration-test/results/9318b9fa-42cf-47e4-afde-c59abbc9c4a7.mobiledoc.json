But the further you dive into XEL, you’ll find that as you weave through the game’s mystery, you’ll discover completely different settings, such as dungeons inspired by ice, fire, and even a horror-themed dungeon!

From the art to the hidden fighting techniques and the crafting intricacies, there’s so much to discover and fall in love with. I really do hope our players are able to unlock the many voice lines and reactions from Reid—those are really fun. We were able to partner with some pretty great voice actors for the game, which really enriched the whole experience and we know that will be a high enjoyment factor in the game. The game’s script is VO in both English and German, which means that the game could feel a little different depending on which language you are playing in, but in the best way possible. As a writer, I don’t think there has to be one definitive version of a character, especially if you consider that their culture could influence their personality and actions."

I think so many developers think of the creation process like, “There’s so much reference material, there’s no way to fuck this up,” but in reality, there’s a lot to fuck up and you will, plenty. This is our first action-adventure game and even though we pushed ourselves well outside of our collective comfort zone, creating a good dungeon crawler takes so much more than watching lots of Game Maker’s Toolkit videos (although, shoutout to Mark Brown because we wouldn’t be here without him!) It takes time to get a dungeon to feel and play right, especially as an indie studio with a limited budget. It seems like every week you wind up spending on something outside of the planned schedule, which means something else has to be sacrificed. (Sorry ‘Fishing Mini-Game” but ‘Dungeon 1” really needed the extra work). "

As a studio, we worked on so many things like shooters, arcade multiplayer games, and I personally even worked on a kart racing game at one point. One thing that many indie devs accept is that you are always working on a sequel of things. Every new game feels like you need to learn to speak a new language over again, but the truth is, we all play and analyze so many great games all the time. We’re constantly trying to figure out what makes them great and shed some of that influence on our own projects where it makes sense. Making something awesome takes time and many, many tries.

          "M: Shoot, I kinda answered that question in the last one. But in general, we hope that you can see how much love we put into this game and that it inspires you. Inspires you to write that book you always wanted to write, to call your grandparents, or to hug a friend. Everyone in our team had this one defining game experience in their life, that inspired them to make games. For me, the initial seed was the first time experiencing Super Mario Bros on the NES. Then, it was nurtured by that Christmas when I first played Ocarina of Time. Games can touch people, and that’s why we make games as a studio. To spark something in people. Even if it is just a short spark of joy after a long day of work."

Rob, my co-founder, and I, bonded in high school over Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast. So some visuals and the soundtrack were, of course, influenced by our love for that universe. "

          "M: If you look at cinema, but also Mangas, the markets or audiences are not that completely different anymore. We all share the same fears, laugh about the same silly stuff, and admire the same character traits in our heroes. I just despise how, for example, western movie studios always think they need to ground Asian IPs more, like that Dragonball Evolution movie, or even the Sonic movies (which turned out way better than I expected). People love new and stupid ideas if they are executed well. So, while I think we all share a lot of things, these things don’t need to be watered down in order to be digestible. We didn’t compromise in telling our story in XEL or when it comes to the visuals. The game looks and sounds how we, as a team with people with plenty of different cultural roots, think it should look and feel. We’re really eager for the feedback on that decision."

          "M: Be kind. To everyone. We grew up with people like Angry Video Game Nerd, who finally pointed out the bullshit in games, but it turned into a phenomenon where that type of criticism turned into outright negativity toward pop culture in general and it’s now thriving as its own content genre. Instead, we should just let people enjoy things without shame. I, myself, fall into that same negativity trap at time. Heck, even my Twitter is the home to many a rant about superheroes. But, before you post something, try to think about the person on the other end of the screen and how their struggles are affecting their output. Only a handful of people really want to rip you off. The world is often better than we perceive it, despite the horrible things that do happen and shake us. "
