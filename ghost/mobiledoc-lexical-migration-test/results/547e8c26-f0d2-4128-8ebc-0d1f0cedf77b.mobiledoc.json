The core strategy of this game revolves around the decisions you make pertaining to the different body parts of your adventurers. You can freely choose 3 adventurers for your team, and send them out dungeon-crawling. Enhance them along free, varying development pathways. Create a motley crew of serious yet chaotically haphazard heroes that bring unique gameplay experiences with each new expedition."
