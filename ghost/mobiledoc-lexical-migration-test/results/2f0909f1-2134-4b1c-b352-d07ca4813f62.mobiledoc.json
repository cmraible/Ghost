And yes, gentle reader, I am alluding to the [Gartner Hype Cycle](http://blogs.gartner.com/john_pescatore/2008/11/21/the-lack-of-wisdom-of-crowds/) here:\n\n![Hypecycle](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/04/hypecycle.png?resize=600%2C450 \"hypecycle.png\")\n\nOnce the flash and dash of the early hype is over, the serious work gets done. We’re seeing some interesting new businesses emerging in the space, like my friends [Agile Elephant](http://www.theagileelephant.com) and now a post Headshift/Dachis Lee Bryant and Livio Hughes with [Post*Shift](http://postshift.com).\n\nThey held their launch part last night, and while I can’t claim to completely understand what the company is right now – some hybrid of an incubator, an investor and a strategic consultant as far as I could tell – I’m certainly interested to see what they do over the next couple of years.\n\n\n## A few interesting notes from the introduction talks\n\n- Existing companies are prone to “innovation tourism” – where they go visit innovators and startups, and then go back to doing exactly what they did before.\n- Existing companies tend to become entities whose purpose is protecting their business model. They’re disruption-adverse.\n- Startups may be *more* professional than many businesses, as they run lean and with zero waste – they just can’t afford it.\n- There are many company structures which have existed conceptually for decades – but which social technology is finally making practical\n- The management consultancy model hasn’t significantly changed in a century. It needs rethinking.\n\nRight at the end of the talks, Lee touched on a small obsession of mine, when he started talking about how the disruption that the internet can bring could interface with more physical businesses – industry, manufacturing and the like ([I’ve written about this for NEXT Berlin](http://nextberlin.eu/2013/11/mobile-industrial-tech-the-next-startup-frontier/)). I’m desperate to see startup thinking and social business start to spread beyond the obvious confines of knowledge workers and mobile apps. Looks like Post*Shift could be planning on making some inroads into a much wider discussion about the future of work – and that could be worth watching.\n\n\n"
