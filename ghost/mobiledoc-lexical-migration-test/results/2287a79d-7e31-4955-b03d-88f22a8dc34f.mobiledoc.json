Originally developed at the beginning of the Great Depression to be the first overhead valve design for the brand’s street bikes, the launch of the new engine was delayed until 1936. The American motorcycle brand used it all the way through 1947, although it stopped for several years during the war effort. Since this is a 1939 model, its engine displaces 61 cubic inches, with the larger 74ci version launching in 1941."
