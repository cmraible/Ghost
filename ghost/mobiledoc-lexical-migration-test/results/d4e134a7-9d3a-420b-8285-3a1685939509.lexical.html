<p>One of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/corvette-racing-success-started-with-c5-r-001/">Corvette motorsports</a> legends was created by Zora Arkus Duntov, chief engineer for Chevrolet. He wanted to use <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-heroes-36-corvettes/">the American sports car</a> to dominate in endurance racing, setting his sights on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-mini-movie-about-the-1955-le-mans/">24 Hours of Le Mans</a>. As Project “Lightweight” was ready for its reveal, it was given a slick new name by the Chevy marketing crew, Grand Sport. Thanks to a conflict between GM and the AMA, only five Grand Sports were made. Of those five, three were sold to private parties.</p>

<p>What we have here is an incredibly detailed recreation of the #003 Corvette Grand Sport piloted by Delmo Johnson. He was one of the three lucky people to buy a Grand Sport, using the first big block racing engine in his car. It was the stuff of legends, something that a lucky person could get a better taste for with this car.</p>
<p>Technically, this car is set to hit the track. There’s a tube frame and full roll cage, plus Mid America body panels. Under the hood is a McLaren Can-Am ZL-1 aluminum big block V8 running a Chevy/Greenwood cross-ram fuel injection manifold. Backing that up is an Auto Gear custom-ratio four-speed transmission, plus custom drive shaft/half shafts. The interior is definitely set up for racing with details like Butler Seats, Simpson 5-point belts, and everything nonessential stripped out.</p>
<p>While patterned after a race car, this conversion is titled and technically legal to drive on public roads, if you so dare. The previous owner never did bumper-to-bumper competitive racing in this Corvette, so it doesn’t have scuff marks you’ll need to repair. Instead, it’s been carefully preserved and mostly used to wow fans at different racetracks.</p>
<p>Rolling up to any car show or wherever else will immediately give you a feel for who knows their racing history. Anyone mocking this recreation obviously doesn’t have any idea what it represents. True fans will be fascinated by it.</p>
<p>The Grand Sport heritage lives on today with Chevrolet having released a Corvette Grand Sport model for each generation since the C4.</p>
