<h3 id="this-chevelle-would-look-absolutely-cool-driving-around-as-is-but-its-just-an-engine-swap-away-from-being-the-ultimate-sleeper">This Chevelle would look absolutely cool driving around as is, but it's just an engine swap away from being the ultimate sleeper</h3>
<p>Not everything from the '60s needs to be a high-output, two-door muscle car to be cool, and this beautifully basic <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9502" rel="noopener">1966 Chevrolet Chevelle 300 Deluxe Sedan</a> is proof. Back in 1966, this beige four-door Chevelle was probably just some little old lady's Sunday cruiser, but after spending its first 53 years with a single family, this creampuff of a sedan will be looking for a new home at the <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/default.aspx" rel="noopener">2019 Fall Carlisle Auction</a>.</p>

<p>This immaculate Chevelle shows a little over 14,000 miles, which is said to be actual miles. And the overall condition of the car appears to substantiate this claim. This Chevelle has obviously been well cared for and garage kept, and it was recently appraised and given a mark of excellent condition.</p>
<p>Further proof that this was just a weekend cruiser, this car is powered by the Chevelle's base engine from 1966: a 194 CID inline-six rated at 120 horsepower. Surprisingly, this Chevelle also features a column-shifted, three-speed manual transmission. This Chevelle has been meticulously maintained and documented since new with written records that date all the way back to 1966!</p>

<p>The Chevrolet Chevelle was completely redesigned for the 1966 model year, and this body style is arguably one of this nameplate's best. This 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle 300 Deluxe Sedan might not be a sporty two-door or the powerful Malibu SS 396 muscle car, but this classic four door is still one slick ride.</p>
