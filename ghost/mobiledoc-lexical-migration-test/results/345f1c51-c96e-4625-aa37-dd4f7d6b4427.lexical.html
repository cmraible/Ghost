<p><a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/89091/9646629">The Jeep name</a> is one of the most popular monikers in the automotive industry. Most drivers have at least considered <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/89091/9685604">owning one</a>, because they are fun, capable, and different than anything else. At the upcoming Henderson Auctions at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, AL, a group <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/89091/9569906">of Jeeps</a> from different eras will come under the hammer. Here are a few highlights.</p>

<p>This classic Willys Jeep Truck has been upgraded with a custom Chevy V8 engine, performance parts, a Champion radiator, and straight pipes. It’s lowered and rolls on Boss Motorsports wheels that are wrapped in Toyo Proxes 4 tires. It has custom leather adjustable seats.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/RackMultipart20220930-20204-1rsm5kh.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="631" height="473" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/RackMultipart20220930-20204-1rsm5kh.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/RackMultipart20220930-20204-1rsm5kh.jpg 631w"></figure>
<p>Meant to be a more civilized version of the CJ-5, the CJ-7 was designed with a 10-inch stretch over the CJ-5 wheelbase, as well as larger door openings. The more unified styling of the CJ-7 are also very evident in that the style was more unified and it was made to be more ‘urban friendly’ than ever before.

<h3 id="2022-jeep-rubicon-392">2022 Jeep Rubicon 392</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/RackMultipart20221012-24796-1s1qirm.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="627" height="473" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/RackMultipart20221012-24796-1s1qirm.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/RackMultipart20221012-24796-1s1qirm.jpg 627w"></figure>
<p>This Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 is rewriting the rules of what it means to be an off-road cruiser. Many will say that a Jeep can’t be a muscle car, but this challenges those notions with a hefty 470/470 split from the Hemi engine.
