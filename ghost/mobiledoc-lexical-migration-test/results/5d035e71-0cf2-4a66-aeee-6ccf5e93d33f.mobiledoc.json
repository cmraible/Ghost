          "Specialty Vehicle Engineering is getting everyone excited for the upcoming release of its newest super muscle car. In a video posted to Facebook, which we’ve embedded in this article, SVE shows off a 2022 Stage II Yenko Camaro doing a dyno test. The result is an astonishing 1100-horsepower, a figure which has the exact effect SVE wanted to achieve."

It’s a way to have some fun while remaining emissions compliant, at least until tailpipe emissions are outlawed. Sadly, that compliance comes at a price since output is a measly 750-hp. Yay for “progress.”"

How this thing sounds out in the open is yet to be determined, but it’s probably a safe bet to say it’ll get the blood pumping. For now, if you’re at work or somewhere you don’t want to disturb others, put on your headphones and enjoy the noise. Otherwise, crank up those speakers and bask in the glory."
