Despite its historical significance, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Brian Sullivan ordered the owners to demolish all structures on the former site of Packard production. The owners have 42 days to start the demolition and abatement work, and 90 days to have it totally cleared out."

          "Designed by Albert Kahn, the Packard plant was built in the early 1900s and has 36,000 employees by the 1940s. After the complex closed in 1958, it was used by other businesses and for storage until the 1990s. In the late 1990s, the building was used for underground raves. It was purchased by the current owners with the intention of renovating it, but the project was abandoned in October 2020 and listed for sale."

          "There’s likely no way to stop what’s coming. If the owner fails to comply, the city will tear it down and send them the bill. If someone bought it with plans to renovate, maybe the judge would grant a temporary halt of the order, but if it hasn’t happened at this point, it’s not likely. What a sad, whimpering ending to the once booming factory, and appropriate callout to the current state of the spirit of the automotive industry."
