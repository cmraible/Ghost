Among the improvements is the shedding of 40 kg of weight (about 88 lbs.), a re-engineered suspension, increased aerodynamic downforce through parts like the enlarged carbon-fiber rear spoiler with a shut-off Gurney to minimize drag when needed. As a true track weapon, it comes armed with louvres in the rear screen, allowing the powertrain to release heat faster, perfect for pushing hard lap after lap. Maintaining contact with the track surface are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, which are softer and have a smoother tread pattern for optimal handling in dry conditions.",
