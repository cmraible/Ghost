<p>Coors Banquet is promoting its brand by giving people the chance to win a fully restored <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/smokey-and-the-bandit-drag-strip/">1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am</a> and enough cash for a year’s worth of beer through a mobile scavenger hunt. It’s all part of a promotion about how Coors Banquet apparently has been smuggled across state lines for a long time, like in the movie <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/burt-reynolds-laid-to-rest/">Smokey and the Bandit</a></em>. What we’re really interested in is the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-trans-am-shop-burns/">muscle car</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Burt Reynolds was finally laid to rest years after he died. Learn more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/burt-reynolds-laid-to-rest/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>To win that ’77 Trans Am, you have to sign up for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-truck-yard-find-collection/">mobile scavenger hunt</a> and be 21 or older with a valid driver’s license. Oh, you’ll also need to travel to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/colorado-car-crash-obliterates/">Colorado</a>, home of Coors, to take place in the hunt. At least that means people won’t be racing all over the country trying to find the car.</p>
<p>There will be a series of 5 clues sent out to participants, the first one coming on the morning of June 11. After solving the clues, participants will need to travel to the location and take a selfie, sending it to the company. There’s also a QR code at each location; after scanning the code, you will receive the next clue on your phone. The person who solves all 5 clues correctly and first will win the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-trans-am-shop-burns/">classic Pontiac Trans Am</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a long time, it sounds like Coors expects this contest to be over quickly. If 72 hours pass and there’s no winner, it’s over. However, if you can’t make it to Colorado to search for a classic muscle car, you can follow the Coors Banquet Instagram account to answer trivia questions and possibly win a year’s supply of the beer. Again, we far and away would rather have the car.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on the action, follow the registration link <a href="https://digitalbeerpromo.com/sw4/MC4195">here</a>. You need to hurry, because the cutoff for registration is Friday, June 11 at 7 am MST.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIJXZxe5VoQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
