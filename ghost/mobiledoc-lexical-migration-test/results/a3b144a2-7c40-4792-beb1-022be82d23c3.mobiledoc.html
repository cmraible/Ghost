<p>According to the listing, less than 1,000 XBGT coupes were built from 1973 to 1976 and only 125 were built in this body style's final year. These cars became a global sensation for car lovers thanks to Mel Gibson and his Mad Max movies, and this particular car has racing history on two continents including drag strips and road courses in both the U.S. and Australia before retiring in 2003. Adding even more lore to this Falcon, it's said to be an all-original, unrestored car with only minor repaints (due to racing) and bolt-on modifications.</p>

<p>According to the listing, this <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20182&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motoriou">Sebring Orange C7 Corvette</a> was the 500th of less than 3,000 ZR1s built for 2019 (the one and only model year that the ZR1 was built), and this is seemingly confirmed by the VIN plate. This ZR1 is still like new with just 4,306 miles showing on the odometer, and it is a fully loaded example with the 3LT trim level and a fully loaded interior.</p>

<p>With a 3.8-liter twin-turbo flat-6 engine pushing an earth-shattering 700-horsepower, this car moves you in a hurry. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission ensures gear transitions happen at lightning-quick speeds and with exacting precision. That leaves your hands free to grip the steering wheel while guiding this performance monster through turns with absolute ferocity.</p>
<p>Since this car comes with the optional Weissach package, <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20183&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the 911 GT2 RS</a> shaves a precious 40 pounds through means like magnesium wheels and additional carbon-fiber components. That means this ride tips the scale at just over 3,200 pounds, making the aero components necessary to keep it glued to the track at higher speeds.</p>

<p>Original Shelby Cobras are among the most valuable and desirable American sports cars ever produced. As a result, they’re the most often replicated as well. Some replicas are better than others.
