It turns out that this particular piece of work is by [Arofish](http://www.arofish.org.uk/arofish/album19), and not Banksy after all.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [art](http://technorati.com/tag/art), [banksy](http://technorati.com/tag/banksy), [graffiti](http://technorati.com/tag/graffiti), [london](http://technorati.com/tag/london)\n\n\n"
