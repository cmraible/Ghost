The paint on it is shot, the window seals are probably swiss cheese, and the interior looks pretty bad. However, it runs and the shop is selling the Porsche for $500. Tom holds it up as an example of how people can get into collecting Porsches if they’re on a tight budget. We keep telling readers you can collect cars if you have a more open mind. Yes, the 924 isn’t the most desirable Porsche, but it beats not having a hobby car or “investing” in a Hyundai Elantra."

However, the man who literally wrote the book about hunting down barn find cars isn’t using his usual plays because of the pandemic. This means no knocking on doors and talking to strangers, plus wearing a mask and social distancing. Even with these restrictions, Cotter still manages to serve up some interesting morsels of entertainment."
