<h2 id="publisher-markup">Publisher Markup</h2>
<p>Google has — for the time being — abandoned its experiments with public Authorship markup. However, publisher markup remains, and can lead to content being highlighted in results. Here’s the <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/4569085?hl=en">Google guidance</a> and <a href="http://www.vervesearch.com/blog/how-to-implement-the-relpublisher-google-authorship-mark-up/">walkthrough on implementation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="repeated-content">Repeated Content</h2>
<p>Google doesn’t like to see the same content repeated in multiple places. Make sure each individual content appears only once on your site - link to it from elsewhere if need be. Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139394">the rel=”cannonical” markup</a> to specify the default URL for a piece of content.</p>
<p>There’s some general advice for dealing with duplicate content of both authorised kind (content exchanges) and stolen (scraping) <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-dealing-with-duplicate-content">on Moz</a></p>
<h2 id="site-speed">Site Speed</h2>
<p>Google has added site performance into its algorithm. Simply put, fast speeds are good, slow speeds are bad. Make sure any pictures you upload to the web are optimised for web viewing. Use <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights">Page Speed Insights</a> to assess your speed, and follow the recommendations given (or pass them on to your developers)</p>
<h2 id="recency">Recency</h2>
<p>Search Engines are increasingly looking for newer content around any issue that could be considered “newsy”. While breaking a story will do well for you in the short term, if your competitors are more efficient in following it up, they will gain traction in the medium term. Follow and develop stories with updates until interest passes.</p>
<h2 id="over-optimisation">Over-optimisation</h2>
<p>Google in particular is making aggressive moves to target content that is created specifically for search engines. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/07/are_infographics_next_on_googles_anti-s.html">Infographics as a link-building tactic</a> are the latest to appear under threat. Rule of thumb: if what you’re doing has benefits for both users and search engines, you should be OK. If you’re gaming the search engines, you’re taking a risk.</p>
<h2 id="isolated-content">Isolated Content</h2>
<p>Content that sits on its own within a site can easily end up down-rated by search engines against your general site ranking. Make sure you have good site linking structure, so that every piece of content is linked by several other pieces of content.</p>
<h2 id="paid-links">Paid Links</h2>
<p>With the advent of the Penguin 2.0 update, paid links that are not <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/a-reminder-about-selling-links.html">correctly no-followed</a> can seriously harm the SEO of both the site linking out and the site paying for the link. </p>
<p>As of March 2020, Google has divided “nofollow” into three different pieces of markup:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>rel=“ugc” </strong>- for user content (for example, comments or a forum)</li>
    <li><strong>rel=“sponsored”</strong> - for use on sponsored content, including native advertising and reviews where goods were provided</li>
    <li><strong>rel=“nofollow”</strong> - for situations where you have made an editorial decision to link to a site, that you don’t endorse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/09/seo-big-changes-are-coming-to-nofollow-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">a deeper explanation of the change</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Google has recently clarified its guidance on goods and services provided for review - in those cases, <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/03/best-practices-for-bloggers-reviewing.html">links back to the providing company or supplier should all be nofollowed</a>.</p>
