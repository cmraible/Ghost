          "Recently, Reuters ran a fascinating article about a man in Singapore who purchased an allotment of automotive chips from Germany and is looking to score big by marking them way up. The original buyer only paid $23.80 for each chip, a reasonable price. However, this guy is looking to sell them to auto suppliers for a whopping $375 each. And while the chips he has stored safely away would fit in the backseat of a car, at that price he would get $23 million for the lot."

Before, chips were something a business would have to sell a lot of to make a little profit. Now, thanks to scarcity, people can afford to sit on their supplies, forcing the scarcity issue so it becomes more severe, then cash in for big money."

          "This is why automakers have started to shift how they acquire chips. Instead of dealing with middlemen, more car companies are looking to establish direct sales agreements with chipmakers. The hope is they will be able to get more microprocessors while the manufacturers pocket more profit in return. Hopefully, these kinds of arrangements result in the resolution of the shortages, something which can’t happen soon enough."

With China’s big push toward electrification, which requires far more chips per vehicle, that’s a huge problem."
