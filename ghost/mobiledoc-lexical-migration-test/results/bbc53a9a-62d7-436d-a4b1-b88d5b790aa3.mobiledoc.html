<p>On Wednesday 4/20 at 8 pm ET (5 pm PT), <em>The Lever</em>’s supporting subscribers will speak to  physician John Abramson about his new book <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/sickening-john-abramson"><em>Sickening: How Big Pharma Broke American Health Care and How We Can Repair It</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>In the new exposé, Abramson, one of the country’s foremost experts on the drug industry’s deceptive tactics, provides the inside story of the tangled web of financial interests that lies at the heart of the U.S. health care system. The result of years of research and privileged access to the inner workings of the medical-industrial complex, <em>Sickening</em> exposes the dark underbelly of American health care — and presents a path forward towards genuine reform.</p>
