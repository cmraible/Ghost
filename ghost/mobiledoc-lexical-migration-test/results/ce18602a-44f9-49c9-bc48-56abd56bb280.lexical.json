After decades of putting out reliable power, tight handling, and a rear-engine design which cannot be beaten, this vehicle and its creator are immensely famous. The '90s were a perfect time for the tiny sports car as this was when modifying the exterior and performance capabilities of exotic cars was becoming popular. Everything from large wings to wide fender flares could be found in these great cars. Nowadays, these vehicles are pretty hard to come by but can be made into a wicked race car, show vehicle, or daily driver if found in proper working order. This car exemplifies that perfectly.",
