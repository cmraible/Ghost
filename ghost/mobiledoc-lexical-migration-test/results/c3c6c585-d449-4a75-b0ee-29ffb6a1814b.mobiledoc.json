Yes, I’d like to thank the lackwit that rammed my parked car with his sometime last night, doing this damage to it. I think the failure to leave any insurance details behind. That was a nice touch.\n\nI’d also like to thank Lewisham police for welcoming me into a locked glass box, where a bored young man gave me a form to fill in while informing that they intended to do absolutely nothing about it. You see, unless somebody inflicts criminal damage on your car under the watchful eye of the CCTV, they’re not interested. Too much like hard work, I presume.\n\nToday has not been a good day. And what, do you think, are the odds of the insurance company deciding to write the car off?\n\n\n"
