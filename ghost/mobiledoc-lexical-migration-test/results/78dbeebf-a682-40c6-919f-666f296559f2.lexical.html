<p>A quick reminder: there’s a major new signal coming to Google search from May 2021. That’s next month at the time of writing. </p>
<p>Time to start thinking about it, if you aren’t already doing so.</p>
<p>Admittedly, most publishers won’t notice an <em>immediate</em> impact, but as time goes on, the impact <em>will</em> be felt by everyone, so the sooner you get on this, the better.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Core Web Vitals will become a ranking signal from sometime next month</li>
    <li>It’s basically a measure of the user-friendliness of your pages</li>
    <li>The change will not be dramatic at first</li>
    <li>The impact of the change will grow over time, as the weight of the signal is increased</li>
</ul>
<p>So, why should you pay attention?</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="the-big-impact">The Big Impact</h3>
<p>You need to pay attention as quickly as you can if you’re in a highly competitive market for search traffic. Search is always a game of marginal advantage. You don’t need to be great at SEO: you just need to be better than your competitors. If their Core Web Vitals are better than yours, they have an advantage. However, if you can get yours up in time for the change, you could gain — or extend — an advantage.</p>
<p>So, if you are in a neck-and-neck battle with fierce competitors for search traffic in a competitive space (like general politics news, for example), the sooner you start paying attention to this, the better.</p>
<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>
<p>If you’re not already a user of <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a>, you need to get in there fast. That’s where you’ll find Google’s estimation of where you sit on its new Core Web Vitals metric.</p>
<p>I’ll talk more about this in some longer posts in the latter half of the month. As always, if your need is more urgent than that <a href="mailto:adam@onemanandhisblog.com">drop me a line</a>.</p>
