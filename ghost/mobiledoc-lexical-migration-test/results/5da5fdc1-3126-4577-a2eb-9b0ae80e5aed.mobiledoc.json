The result will be continued price inflation for used cars, squeezing the lowest-income individuals the most. People will grow tired of the situation and maybe, just maybe there will be enough pressure to walk back some of the regulations forcing automaker to use gross amounts of chips in new cars. But, with industry executives downplaying the ever-lengthening timeline of the shortage and painting a rosy picture of the long-term future, there will be many who resist any big changes like that. Personally, I’d love to see drivers with stick shifts and other low-tech solutions which make them pay attention while they’re behind the wheel again."
