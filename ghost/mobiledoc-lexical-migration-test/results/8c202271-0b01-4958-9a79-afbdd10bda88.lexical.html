<p>A new experiment for the new year. I've had in mind a more ‚Äúbloggy‚Äù style of newsletter for a while now: links with quick commentary and analysis of relevant news stories and posts. Finding the timing has been the issue. </p>
<p>Why? Well, the morning slot is pretty well occupied, so I'm taking a punt on the early afternoon/lunchtime slot. That has the advantage of being lunchbreak in the UK and Europe and first thing in the morning in the US and Canada ‚Äî a nice time when people have room to quickly browse some interesting internet stuff. </p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I have a workflow that will make this practical, even on days when I'm lecturing or running courses, but the proof will be in the publishing.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="itv-news-breaking-stories-on-a-podcast">ITV News breaking stories on a podcast</h2>
<p>With apologies to non-UK readers, it's very interesting to note that ITV News, one of the big broadcast news operators here, have chosen to break a story about our ex-prime minister (not, not the last one, the one before) on a podcast.</p>
<p>The seven episode podcast series looks set to make the Tory party, already seriously on the political back foot, have a torrid start to 2023 just as they were hoping to move on. But it's worth us noting that here we have a broadcast news outlet treating a podcast series as a viable medium in its own right. The idea of podcasts as promotion for the ‚Äúreal‚Äù outlet is very much dead.</p>

<h2 id="the-print-tipping-point">The Print Tipping Point</h2>
<p>Thomas Baekdal started an interesting thread on Mastodon about <a href="https://mastodon.social/@baekdal/109659583086400289">the decline of newspapers</a>. He pointed out that, if you adjust for population growth, newspaper readership has been in steady decline since the 1960s, with a small acceleration thanks to the internet.</p>
<p>In other words, we can't blame the internet for what's happening to printed newspapers. And it might now be too late to save most of them, as Steve Yelvington <a href="https://s.yelvington.com/@steve/109666188397587375">pointed out in that thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote>But we are now at a point where the business model breaks. Printing is no longer economically sustainable, so you see newspapers cutting editions, outsourcing the distant plants, and eventually going online-only. And since the online business model will not deliver the cash necessary to sustain large newsrooms and the content they create, we are seeing precipitous localized dropoffs along with the long-term trends.</blockquote>
<p>And then the final üî•:</p>
<blockquote>In other words, there's nothing to read in the paper, even if there is one.</blockquote>

<p>Folks, we're in the third decade of the 21st century. People do not queue up to get things on release day - they preorder them from Amazon. Sending out photographers to capture the earlier buyers is pointless.</p>
<p>Remember the ‚Äúnew iPhone‚Äù queue photos? Bet you haven't seen any in a while - and it's not because iPhones aren't still selling great.</p>
