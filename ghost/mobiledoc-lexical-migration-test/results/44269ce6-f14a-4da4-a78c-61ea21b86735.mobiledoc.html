<hr>
<p>People have been customizing their cars since the earliest days of the automobile, and everybody has their own tastes from foreign to domestic and from lowriders to jacked-up trucks. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">Hotrods </a>are perhaps the most iconic custom vehicle of all time, but as modern collector car owners want vintage styling with modern performance, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/restomod/">restomods </a>continue to grow in popularity.</p>
<p>What we have here are two gorgeous examples of both types of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/custom/">custom </a>vehicles showing that the more things change, the more things stay the same. With similar prices of just under $80,000, we want to know <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-six-figure-muscle-car-would-you-buy/">which one you'd drive</a>.</p>

<p>The 1973 film, <em>American Graffiti</em>, immortalized hot rods and cruising culture, and this 1932 Ford five-window coupe is done up to look just like one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/15-movie-cars/">movie's star cars</a>. With its bright yellow paint and shiny chrome accents, this Ford looks amazing, and with the 350 cubic-inch small-block Chevy V8, this is sure to be a strong cruiser, too. This incredible specimen of a five-window Ford is completely spotless, and it's up for sale through <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/200254/1932-ford-5-window-coupe-street-rod-american-graffiti">Vanguard Motor Sales</a> for $74,900.</p>

<p>If restomods are more your speed, then this 1967 Chevrolet Camaro is an amazing build. For starters, this Camaro is packing a 6.2-liter LS3 with a Tremec six-speed manual, and to ensure that it has a modern ride quality ready for the road or the track, it also has a pro-touring suspension with front coilovers and adjustable rear leaf springs. This Camaro definitely has the looks to back up its restomod build retaining the Camaro RS' hidden headlights and complementing the classic lines with a Cherry Red paint job and white rally sport nose stripe, while staggered-width Foose 18-inch wheels finish off the aggressive stance. </p>
<p>Like the Ford hotrod, this Camaro is priced under $80,000 with <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/199827/1967-chevrolet-camaro-rs-ss-ls3-pro-touring-restomod">No Reserve Classics</a> currently listing it for $79,995.</p>
