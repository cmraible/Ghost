<p>Back in the summer of 2019 Ford wowed enthusiasts when it revealed the Predator, a 760-hp supercharged 5.2-liter V8. It was the most powerful engine used in a street-legal Ford to date. Immediately, comparisons between it and the Dodge Hellcat flared up with the Blue Oval faithful rejoicing in its arrival. Well, a lot of has changed since then, including Mopar offering the Hellcat crate engine and now Ford’s following suite with the Predator crate engine.</p>
<blockquote><em>Meanwhile, Chevrolet has revealed a 10.4-liter V8 crate engine you can see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-performance-10-4-liter-v8/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>That’s right, you can finally do a predator swap into your F-150, classic Mustang, Torino, Pinto, Fox Body Mustang… the possibilities are endless. Maybe this will stop people from swapping Hellcat and LS engines into Fords, although that trend might continue.</p>

<p>Ford Performance Parts is selling the Predator V8 as a “replacement engine” so you know and can laugh at that. Come on, we know there aren’t that many GT500s with a roasted engine which need a heart transplant, but why does Ford Performance Parts have to go with that delusion?</p>
<p>Called the Ford Performance Parts M-6007-M52SC, it comes with the whole accessory drive like the AC compressor, supercharger belt, and the alternator. Also included is a Ford Performance factory warranty, in case that’s a concern of yours. However, it’s possible that’s voided if you throw this in something other than a GT500, so you know.</p>

<p>Before you get too excited, just know the Predator V8 crate engine isn’t exactly cheap. It’s listed for $25,995 so that’s a barrier to keep just anyone from buying one. However, keep in mind MSRP for the Hellcat crate engine (the Hellcrate for all you pedantry types) is just $19,530. In other words, the Predator is pricey for what you get. However, if you’re a died-in the-wool Ford fan it might be worth it just to stick it to the Mopar crowd.</p>
