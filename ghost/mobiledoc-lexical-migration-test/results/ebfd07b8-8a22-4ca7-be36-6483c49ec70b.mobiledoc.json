An older  restoration has left the green paint and that leather saddle looking  authentic and good. McQueen was such a fan he would ride this around his  ranch in Santa Paula as well as the surrounding neighborhood, despite  the extremely loud short exhaust stubs."

That alone makes this bike significant, but the fact McQueen  owned it only adds to its value. When it was originally decommissioned  from racing, this Excelsior was purchased by Hollywood stuntman Bud  Ekins, who in turn sold it to McQueen. It was auctioned from McQueen’s  estate in 1984 and has a well-documented history."
