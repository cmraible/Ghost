<p>One of the most beautiful muscle cars to roll off the assembly line was the 1967 Pontiac GTO. Considered "America's Original Muscle Car", the GTO's distinctive front grille made it distinguishable from the rest. Not only was the car aesthetically stunning, the classic Pontiac was packed full of performance. Here's your chance to take home a car that helped kick off the muscle car era - a concours-worthy restored <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/gto?promo=MOTORIOUS12">1967 Pontiac GTO 400 H.O.</a> sport coupe.

<p>Given a meticulous restoration to the highest standard, this classic GTO is finished in a stunning TYrol Blue. Only 43 miles have been accumulated on the clock since its nut-and-bolt frame-off restoration. Given the finest restoration components available today with the help of Ames Performance, this Pontiac has won multiple national trophies including Gold-Concours and Senior Concours from the Pontiac-Oakland Club International and Concours-Gold from the GTO Association of America (GTOAA). This beautiful gem is bound to turn heads and garner attention no matter where it goes.</p>
<p>Under the hood sits a numbers-matching 400 H.O. engine that generates a healthy 360-horsepower that is shifted down to a Safe-T-Track limited-slip rear end via a 4-speed manual transmission. Engineers at Pontiac were unaware that they were kicking off an entire muscle car era when they stuffed the 389-cubic-inch engine inside the mid-size LeMans Coupe to offer the high-performance GTO. </p>
<p>Open the doors to an immaculate black interior complete with bucket seats. The car also is equipped with Wonder Touch power steering to easily maneuver corners, and it features a radio delete, a rear defogger, and an outside remote-control mirror.</p>
