In stark contrast to NASCAR \"stock\" cars from the last 40 years, the V8 Supercars series is about as close to stock as you can get even including the factory 3.8-liter fuel-injected V6 and four-speed automatic. After being retired from racing, the no. 8 Holden Commodore was purchased and owned by the same person since 2005,  and it was last raced in 2006 before undergoing a restoration back to its 2001 Castrol livery and including a fully rebuilt powertrain."

Nissan even ran a tribute to this Castrol \"Silver Bullet\" livery at the 2019 Bathurst 1000. Included with this Holden's $260,000 purchase price, the seller apparently threw in two sets of wheels (each set wearing racing slicks and wet weather tires) as well as the racecar's logbooks and paperwork from Ingall's former team, Perkins Engineering."
