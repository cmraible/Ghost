These cars haven’t made it to the road yet, and people are absolutely frothing over them. While the mid-engine Corvette was one of the biggest game changers, the new 8th generation Z06 Corvette is going to elevate performance like no one has ever seen before. Just like with all of the C8 Corvettes, it’s going to be pretty difficult to find one, and if you do, don’t count on it being cheap. However, thanks to the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation (CMAF), you can own one for as little as a $25 donation, with more entries as a Motorious reader.",
