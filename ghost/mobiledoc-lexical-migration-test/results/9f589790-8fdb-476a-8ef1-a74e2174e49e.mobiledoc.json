For instance, the Nova is running slicks and skinnies with 415/50s in the rear giving it more grip. Where the Corvette's carbon-kevlar body may lighten the car significantly the Novas extra weight may help give it more traction, not to mention the fact that the corvette is still running Falken drift tires."

In the end, the Nova won this episode even going so far as to win in the bonus round in which the Nova chased and still won by almost a car length. Even though Matt jumped the line every time the purpose-built drag car still won. The funny thing about this Nova is that because it is street-legal this guy got to drive his Corvette-killer home after a triumphant win."
