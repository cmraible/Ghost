          "In 1991, GMC had an idea that was nothing short of awesome. A performance truck with sport car capabilities. The Syclone was an aggressively styled truck based off the GMC Sonoma. It featured a 280-horsepower turbocharged 4.3-liter engine backed by a 4L60 4-speed automatic transmission, a Borg Warner all-wheel drive transfer case, and a sport-tuned suspension. This combination of factory installed modifications to the small truck platform allowed the truck to accelerate to 60-mph in just 4.3-seconds and run through the quarter-mile in 13.4-seconds according to car and driver, though a "

That being said, it is still a truck and suffers from a disproportionate weight distribution. It also doesnâ€™t have a very good towing/load capacity. Still, the Syclone's capabilities far outweigh its shortcomings."

Although a lot has changed over the past couple of decades and may be the Syclone could succeed if given a second chance. Since the Sonoma has since been discontinued all-together, maybe GMC could give the twister-treatment to a Canyon. Since the 2021 Canyons available 308-horsepower has raised the bar, a new version of the Syclone name would have to be really extreme."
