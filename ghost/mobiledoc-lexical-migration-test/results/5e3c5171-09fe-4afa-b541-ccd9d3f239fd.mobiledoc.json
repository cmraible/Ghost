More often than not, these cars were stored for years as to increase value over the years so the owner could cash in on a big chunk of change. IronTrap Garage posted a video of them rescuing a rare 1954 Chevrolet Corvette that has been sitting for half a century collecting dust. Watch this classic pushed into the daylight for the first time since it was first stashed in 1968. This rare barn find Corvette was scheduled to hit the auction block on April 18th but is now set for July 11th according to the website provided in the YouTube video description."

Originally equipped with the \"Blue Flame\" Inline-6, the car is now stuffed with an early small-block Chevy V8 engine. This classic gem is finshed in the very rare factory color of Sportsman Red, a color that was given to just 4 percent of the cars produced in 1954. "
