In place of the 911's boxer engine, RUF installed an electric motor rated at 201 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, while the lithium-ion batteries replace the rear seats. RUF's timeline says that the company presented \"the first German electric automobile\" in October 2008, but sadly this high-performance electric vehicle never made it past the prototype phase."

Based on the first-generation (955) Porsche Cayenne, the RUF Dakara tuned the twin-turbo V8 to produce 600 horsepower, and in true tuner style, gave the SUV a distinctive design. In addition to the wide fenders and massive 22-inch wheels, the Dakara has a bespoke front end design that grafted 911 headlights into the nose."

The 997 911 Targa featured a large sliding glass roof panel, but this RUF build added a retro Targa roof to the modern 911. Like the original 911 Targa was introduced in 1967 with a removable roof panel, stainless steel roll bar and a soft, convertible-style rear window area, and all of these were recreated on the RUF RT Roadster."

This larger-displacement engine produced 301 horsepower, which is significantly more than the 217 hp from a base Boxster and the 250 hp from the Boxster S."
