          " board, Professor Ernst Fuhrmann, saw that good race results fueled car sales. That’s why he pushed for a lightweight, more powerful version of the 911. At a time when high oil prices and increased emissions standards were a dominant factor in the market, the first Carrera RS used a 2.7-liter flat-six instead of the 2.4-liter engine. That meant a boost to 210-horsepower, which was plenty to get the car that weighed just over 2,000 pounds moving from 0-60 in under 6 seconds. It also could hit 155 mph. While the Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 was still seen on this continent during races in RSR form, a road-legal version wasn’t available until 1974."
