<hr>
<p>You hear about barn finds all the time and rightfully might be suspicious of them. After all, seeing videos of a nearly perfect old car with a thin layer of dust pulled out of some old barn can seem staged. However, this <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851633-1958-Chevrolet-Corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1958 Chevrolet Corvette</a> is nothing of the sort and it has all the imperfections to testify of its original nature. Brought to light and now on the bidding block at <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Awesome Joe Auctions</a>, this C1 Corvette is pretty incredible to see.</p>

<p>Maybe you always fantasized about owning a genuine barn find but locating one yourself hasn’t been as easy as the shows make it seem. At least this way you could scoop the car and decide what to do with it. Do you keep it original or give it a nut-and-bolt restoration? The choice is yours.</p>

<p>According to the auction listing, this Corvette was parked in a barn back in 1985 when it had been recently repainted. It certainly doesn’t look like it had a cover over it, even though the barn provided some shelter from the elements, because the paint has some imperfections. Call it some character over time or patina, many people these days pay handsomely for that kind of effect.</p>

<p>Being a ’58, this C1 has those dramatic scalloped sides painted a fiery red, which really contrasts with the black body and the ample chrome trim. Keeping with that theme is the red upholstery, carpeting, and dash. Original details are visible everywhere. The seller states there’s a Dewitts radiator, new wiring harness, new front disc brakes, new Bilstein shocks, new top, new upholstery, new radio, and vintage air which still blows cold. Powering this ride is a brand new small block V8 fashioned to look period-correct, while a manual four-speed backs it up.</p>
