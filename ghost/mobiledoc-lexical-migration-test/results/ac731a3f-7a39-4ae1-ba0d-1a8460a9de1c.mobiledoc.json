Production numbers jumped to over 3k-units and available options included three additional colors. Initially, the Corvette only had one powertrain option, a 235-cid inline 6 (Blue Flame) engine, and a two-speed automatic Powerglide transmission. Although the engine produced decent power for what it was, it did not do the Corvettes reputation of being a solid contender to the Cadillacs and Jaguars of the time any favors. 1955 marked the roadster’s first V8 engine option and it was that 195-horsepower 265-cid engine that nudged Chevy in the right direction with many upgrades coming the following year.

For the first year ever, the Corvette was now available with outside door handles, roll-up windows, and an optional removable hardtop. 1957 saw the introduction of a new 283-cid engine and a Fuel Injected option that produced a national record of 1-bhp per cubic inch. Nearly 7,000 examples were produced that year. Styling, power, and production numbers continued to rise before peaking for the final year of the C1 Corvette. Chevy’s halo roadster had become a crisp-styled sports car with an available 360-horsepower. In all, over 69k C1 Corvettes were made."

A new aerodynamic body, a fastback coupe labeled the split-window, was introduced as was a new independent front and rear suspension system. The 327-cid engine remained standard and outputs ranged from 250 to 360-horsepower. Although the Corvette was clearly special and could barely be compared to anything else on the road, many of the parts used were now interchangeable with other GM models and production jumped to over 20k.

          "Keeping the same basic shape, the C3 slowly evolved into a more modern-looking car. Performance fluctuated throughout this generation as well, thanks to changing regulations. 1979 set a sales record with over 53k examples being produced. By 1982, the Corvette’s power output had dwindled to just 200-horsepower and it was clear that the car needed to be updated. Unfortunately, production delays pushed that upcoming update back and the Corvette took a hiatus from production for the first and only time ever in 1983. "

          "Chief Corvette designer Dave McLellan was tasked with bringing the Corvette into the modern era. Stepping away from his predecessor’s design, McLellan created a more comfortable Corvette with a sleeker style. Thanks to a glass hatchback design the car now had a more accessible storage space which was large enough for a set of golf clubs. This only perpetuated the Corvette’s image of being the official car of the mid-life crisis. However, this generation was a revolutionary one in many ways. A digit display was now featured on the dash, the styling was more aerodynamic than ever before, braking and handling were better than any other generation, and the high-performance engine options were back with a vengeance."

The ZR1’s LT5 engine was the product of a collaboration between GM and Lotus, giving the Corvette a 375-horsepower rating which was later raised to 405-horsepower. As powerful as the new ZR1 was, the bragging rights for the fastest C4 produced is the B2K Callaway Twin-Turbo, a variant of which an 880-horsepower variant went over 250-mph. "

Replacing the LT engine of the previous generation was the LS1 engine that produced 345-horsepower. Wanting to improve the Corvette’s weight distribution and handling characteristics, Chevy moved to a rear-mounted transaxle setup connecting the engine to the transmission by way of a torque tube. This resulted in a 50/50 weight distribution which aided in handling and improved traction and ride quality. Another improvement of note was that the C5 was the first Corvette to have a trunk since the 1960s."

Although the car was still being used by GM to roll out new technology, the C5 Corvette did not change much visually from year to year after the 1999 model year. Some of the changes included a gradual bump in power output, peaking with 405-horsepower in 2004, and the addition of a heads-up display. The generation was a highly successful one that proved the Corvette could both keep up with Ferrari and be fuel-efficient enough to avoid the Gas-Guzzler Tax. In keeping with tradition, there were many special editions of the C5 Corvette. This included the Z06, an Indy 500 car, a 50th Anniversary Edition, and a Commemorative Edition. "

Instead of hiding the headlights behind a body-colored panel, the car now wore highly-styled LED headlights that were worked into an angular body design.

It was clear that that platform had had its limits pushed to the breaking point. This led designers to finally pull the trigger on a vision that the father of the Corvette himself was unable to see through, a mid-engine Corvette. This required a complete ground-up redesign of the car and a stronger focus on aerodynamics. Nearly all of the new Corvettes bodywork is purposeful and functional. In addition to better handling characteristics, the new design also allowed for a more comfortable interior and more storage space. "
