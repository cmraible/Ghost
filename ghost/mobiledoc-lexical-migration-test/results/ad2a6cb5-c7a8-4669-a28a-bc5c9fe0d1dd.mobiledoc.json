Supposedly, GM wants to do the same thing with the Corvette and Escalade. This could mean crossover versions of the Camaro and Corvette, maybe some sedans, a compact Escalade, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together… mass hysteria!"

In fact, production for it was paused repeatedly last year, signaling GM considers it a dog. The Escalade and Corvette, on the other hand, have huge loyal followings, so creating a lineup of models under those names seems like a natural fit."

Beautiful body lines, great choice of power options, and a four-speed manual transmission made this car the perfect cruiser and race car for fans of the brand in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Nowadays we tend to think of them sort of like idols and become overjoyed pretty much every time we see one driving around but we also have to remember that they are still cars and I search the people the drivers behind the wheel are still people."

          "Recently, a video surfaced on the Internet showing a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle smacking right into the side of a minivan. Articles referencing the event claim that he was trying to show off though the camera pans away right before the big action happens, what a coincidence. Whatever happened, the driver of the Chevelle made a mistake and lost control which resulted in a pretty massive crash flipping the minivan and destroying the front side of his car. It was also raining so the road was already a little slippery adding for the possibility of simple driver error rather than Mal intent or purposeful negligence on the road."
