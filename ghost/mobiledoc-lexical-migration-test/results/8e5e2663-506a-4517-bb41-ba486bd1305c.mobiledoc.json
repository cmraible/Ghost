While everyone was hoping for 2021 to be a little better, it is actually not trending that way and as of the end of January, less than 5,000 "

If you want to increase your odds, you can donate more. For example, a $250 donation is worth 180 tickets and for $2,500 you will get 2,800 tickets. As a Motorious reader though, you get 25-percent more tickets regardless of how much you donate. All donations benefit the cause of preserving and sharing the history of motorsports for future generations. This is a great cause and a great prize, so don’t miss out. "
