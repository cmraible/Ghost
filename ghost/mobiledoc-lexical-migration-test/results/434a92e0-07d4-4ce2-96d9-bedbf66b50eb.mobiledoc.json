A report from The Times in the UK highlights how criminals are buying devices enabling them to swipe modern rides for not that much cash, plus these devices are disguised like legitimate items. That means if the thieves are stopped by cops before they swipe a car and are searched, officers likely won’t realize what they’re up to."

On certain models, this can be done from the exterior of the car, usually through electronic components located in the front end. This means thieves are removing the bumper cover in part or entirely so they can access those systems."
