<p>Today, I’d like to highlight one of the many amazing entries for the online car show. This <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries/2/Sports-Exotics/264">1997 Dodge Viper GTS</a> was submitted by @Pro_Tour_Viper_GTS and quite frankly just the look of it makes my heart beat a little faster.</p>
<p>According to the owner, this snake was built by NASCAR driver Dick Turner and is fully prepped for road racing. Even in factory spec, a Viper GTS is a potent car, but this one has about 300 pounds of weight reduction to boost performance all around. The engine has been modified and as you can see in the photos, there’s a roll cage installed. This Dodge rides on an adjustable competition suspension, uses big slotted disc brakes, 18x12 wheels, and a gear-drive limited-slip differential to reign all that in.</p>
