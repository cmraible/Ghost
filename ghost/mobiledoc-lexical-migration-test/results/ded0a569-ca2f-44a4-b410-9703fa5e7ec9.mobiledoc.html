<p>“For many people, it’s their only chance to ride in a Model T,” said David Flatt, the museum’s executive director, noting that riding in the Ford Model T was the biggest draw of the event. A handful of them will be available to take visitors around the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A classic car show with about 20 cars is also a draw, with all vehicles being built before 1947 when <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/henry-ford-quotes/">Henry Ford</a> died. “They’ll all be very rare type cars,” said David Flatt. He also added that most of the cars will be from the early part of the 1900s.</p>

<p>This is a family friendly event with different children’s activities planned. A local author will do a reading of her book that explains Detroit in the alphabet, with “F” being for Ford, obviously. The kids will also get to color in Model T themed coloring books, word searches, and puzzles.</p>
<p>Vendors are also heading to the event to offer attendees a chance to buy memorabilia, and various other things. Visitors will be able to access the museum for free and see the only complete Ford letter car collection in the world.</p>
