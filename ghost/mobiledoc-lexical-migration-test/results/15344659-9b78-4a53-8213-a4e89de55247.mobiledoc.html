Much to my surprise, I had to queue for 20 minutes to get in, and this was mid-afternoon. Goodness only knows what it was like that morning.</p>
<p>Still, the store has a pleasing aesthetic, there was a nice atmosphere in the queue, despite the rain, and I got the goods I wanted, despite the crowds.</p>
