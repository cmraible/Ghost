However, we’ve been told by some who live in that area of the world there’s some serious social tension between those who love a classic Camaro or Charger and those who think the only good car is one that’s safe and new. Maybe that’s at least in part why a Volvo XC60 R with three sets of wheels crashed a classic American car meet a little while ago."

However, the crazy Volvo 6X6 catches his eye because who does such a thing to a midsize crossover billed as a safe way to haul the kiddies to soccer practice?"

In a way it’s ironic considering the Volvo badge literally has the Mars symbol on its badge, a symbol which has stood for masculinity for some time. That’s not to say Volvo has lived up to that symbol, because it’s made quite a few not only funky but quite frankly wimpy cars."

With the extended body, the builder decided to make a pickup bed in the rear, almost like this is the Swedish El Camino or Ranchero."
