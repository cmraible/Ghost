It became his dream car and the man resolved to buy one if he ever could afford it, which of course he reached that point rather early and did purchase the Jag. Funny enough, the British roadster broke down on the way home from the dealership, thus began Musk’s struggle between man and machine. In fact, he said of the Jaguar, “that one was like a bad girlfriend – it kept breaking down on me and causing all sorts of trouble.”",
