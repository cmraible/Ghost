This is officially the most powerful production Mustang engine ever made, and it sounds equally amazing thanks to the active exhaust with quad tips. This power is sent to the rear tires through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic and a limited-slip rear differential, while features such as Launch Control and Line Lock help drivers maximize their performance driving capabilities from this car."
