A 2018 Dodge Charger was laying on its passenger side in a house’s backyard, the driver stuck inside. However, it was quickly determined 29-year-old Burgandy Rose Thomas of Peculiar, Missouri was dead."

This whole matter is no laughing matter – it’s a reminder of the awesome power cars pack. Unfortunately, the driver of the Charger didn’t respect the machine and its capabilities, paying with her life."
