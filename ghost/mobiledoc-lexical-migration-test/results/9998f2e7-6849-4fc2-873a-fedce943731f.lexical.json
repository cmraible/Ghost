Most new cars, or even cars made post-2016, come with push button start ignitions, especially more expensive ones. That might have been a huge design mistake by car makers that’s made it easier to steal them. This could be adding to the surge in auto thefts, although, car thieves will always find a way, regardless of the ignition.",

Next, park inside at all costs, with the doors locked, and the key far away from the car, trust me, your car will crank much further away from the keys than you know. We’re not going to pretend to have the answers, since you’re eventually going to have to leave your car alone in a parking lot, but maybe this is one technology its time automakers roll back on.",
