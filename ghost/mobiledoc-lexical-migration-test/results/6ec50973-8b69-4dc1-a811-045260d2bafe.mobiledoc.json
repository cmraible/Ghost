Occupy Wall Street and the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline took off shortly afterward, injecting a broader swath of the climate movement with an anti-corporate spirit that put the target rightfully on the people and institutions shaping flows of carbon and capital. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential run raised the possibility that elected officials could further the same goals.
