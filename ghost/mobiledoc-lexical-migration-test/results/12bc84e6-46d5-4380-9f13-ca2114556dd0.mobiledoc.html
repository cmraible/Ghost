<p><a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=21646">The Renault</a> was a car that stuck out in its era for its sleek sloping front end. It also had a creatively placed radiator that was behind the engine, to enable the identifying looks so well. This award winning 1912 Renault Type CB Coupe De Ville is a perfect example of the time, and you can bring it home to your collection.</p>
