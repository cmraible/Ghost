It also clarified that in Iowa the law states a supplier must notify a consumer of several rights and provide authorization forms for work, something Okoboji Classic Cars failed to do. The court also ruled that the oral agreement between the Pollers and the shop was binding. In other words, a shop can’t just run up the bill after a customer tells them to limit work to a specific dollar amount."
