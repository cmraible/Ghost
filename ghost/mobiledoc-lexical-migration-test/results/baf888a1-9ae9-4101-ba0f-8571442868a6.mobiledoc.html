<p>There was once a man on a quest for over the ear headphones that were both noise cancelling and wireless. Much like Morpheus in the Matrix asked a young Keanu Reeves do you want the blue pill… or the red one!? This man was faced with Bose Quiet Comfort 35 or Sony MDR 1000X? Let’s compare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comfort:</p>
<p>both headphones are easy to wear for an extended period of time. However the QC35s are a bit lighter and in my humble opinion more comfortable to wear.</p>
