<p>Under the hood is a monstrous 5.0-liter V8 that makes around 430-horsepower naturally aspirated, however, true Shelby fanatics will know that this engine is supercharged. A Whipple Supercharger helps the vehicle achieve a whopping 624 horsepower. Mated to that beast of an engine is a 6-speed manual transmission which allows you to get the most fun out of your driving experience just as Carroll Shelby would have wanted it. While power is all well and good the <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/2011-shelby-gt350?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=April21">Ford Mustang</a> is best known for its choice of handling that sheer power. That's why this thing is equipped with Ford Racing suspension so that you can carve up canyons and crush corners without breaking a sweat. </p>
