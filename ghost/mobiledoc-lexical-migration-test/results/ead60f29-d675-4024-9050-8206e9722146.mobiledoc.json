You get to control that beast via a Tremec 5-speed manual, returning to the days when true performance cars always featured a third pedal. A limited-split rear differential helps you put that power to the ground while electronic ignition provides some modern reliability."

          "You’ll note this ’65 Mustang looks great, thanks in no small part to the fiberglass GT350-style hood and fiberglass front valance. On closer inspection, you’ll also see the 17-inch Vintage Wheel Works wheels and GT-style fuel door, and the dual exhaust finishers which exit through the rear valance for extra flair. This machine is a real head-turner."

There’s Classic Auto Air air conditioning to keep you cool when summer returns, although you always have the option of dropping the top to feel the breeze. TMI vinyl and Alcantara seat covers do a great job of not only looking great but spoiling you so long drives are a joy."
