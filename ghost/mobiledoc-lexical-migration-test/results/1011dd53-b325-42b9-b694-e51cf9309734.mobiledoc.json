Yes, the 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS with the 454ci LS5 V8 is a monster, the kind of muscle car that will eat other muscle cars from the golden age of muscle for breakfast. Officially, that engine is rated at 365-horsepower and 465 lb.-ft. of torque, but you be the judge if that’s accurate or not."

The 350ci V8 in super high compression spec (that’s 10.25:1) is rated at 310-hp and 390 lb.-ft. of torque, which certainly isn’t horrible but does mean the Olds is outgunned. Rounding out the factory setup is a TH350 3-speed automatic, but a set of 3.73 rear gears has been installed. Plus, this Cutlass S has an advantage when it comes to weight, tipping the scale at just 3,474 lbs."
