Thousands have been evacuated as the inferno keeps spreading, despite the efforts of firefighters. While you might hear some blame the cause of this blaze on climate change, because a temporary spike in temperatures in Europe now qualifies as climate, the actual point of ignition was an electric car."

Since the French have been pushing electrification big time it could be any one of the many electrified models used in the European nation. Will more information be forthcoming or will this detail of how the fire started be kept under wraps?"

France rolled out a whole fleet of electric buses, but after two caught fire this year, they were all parked out of caution. While nobody was hurt, these types of incidents call into question the utopian electric car future story spread around in the media so readily."
