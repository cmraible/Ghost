You see, today, the rumours said, we’d get a phone with iTunes (and [we did](http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/)), and maybe, just maybe a video iPod. Instead, we got this:<span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">  \n  \n</span>\n\n[![Ipodnano](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2005/09/ipodnano-tm.jpg?resize=400%2C250 \"Ipodnano\")](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2005/09/ipodnano.jpg)<span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"></span>\n\nIt’s got the same capacity as the original iPod or the recent iPod Minis, but it’s tiny. It’s got a colour screen. It’s called the [iPod nano](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodnano/).\n\nAnd it doesn’t play videos.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [apple](http://www.technorati.com/tag/apple), [ipod](http://www.technorati.com/tag/ipod), [ipod nano](http://www.technorati.com/tag/ipod nano), [music](http://www.technorati.com/tag/music), [technology](http://www.technorati.com/tag/technology)\n\n\n"
