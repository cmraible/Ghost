<p>It’s not too difficult to understand why Amphicars like this one have a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2jz-engine-strong/">strong cult following</a>. Granted, not everyone wants a car they can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/six-classic-cars-found-sunk-in-a-river/">drive down a boat ramp and launch into the water</a>, or vice versa, but those who want such a thing don’t have many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic cars</a> to choose from. In fact, this is one of a mere 3,878 made, so hunting down one isn’t exactly a walk in the park.</p>
<p>This Amphicar could easily lead to love at first sight, thanks in no small part to the Aquamarine exterior over a teal interior. Plus, there’s a removable hardtop so you can enjoy the weather properly. All that, combined with simple body lines communicates a kind of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-shelby-cobra-csx/">unrestrained joy</a> which is missing in the modern automotive market. Plus, you don’t see a propeller sticking out of the back of many cars, no matter where you go, and that’s just a small part of the fun.</p>
<p>You get plenty of power with this ’69 Amphicar, thanks to the 3.8-liter Buick V6 onboard. Backing that up is a three-speed automatic transmission donated from a Dodge Power Wagon. You get to reference custom digital gauges, a cool modern treatment you might not expect in such a vehicle.</p>
<p>If you live near water or go to the lake or harbor often, this Amphicar takes the hassle out of getting into and out of the water. Plus, it’s a real head-turner and conversation piece people smile at when they see it in action.</p>
<p>Just listed on Motorious, this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194129/1969-amphicar">1969 Amphicar</a> probably won’t last long. These are rare and highly sought-after cars, and that’s not an exaggeration in the least, so if you’ve wanted one you might want to give serious consideration for making a move on this before it’s gone.
