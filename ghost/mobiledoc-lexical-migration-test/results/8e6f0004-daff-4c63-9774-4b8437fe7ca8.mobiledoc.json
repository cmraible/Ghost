Finished in Onyx Black with silver stripes, the Cobra is riding on 17-inch Halibrand-style knock-off wheels that give it a classic yet modern look that is true to the Cobra’s heritage. Inside is a gray leather upholstery that is accented with polished hardware and a 14-inch hardwood-rimmed steering wheel frames a simple dash with all of the gauges needed. Under the hood is a 342R Roush Performance engine mated to a 5-speed World Class Tremec manual transmission. With 450-horsepower ceramic coated headers and the vintage Cobra side exhaust, this car is just as powerful as it is beautiful. And with a BMW E36 M3 suspension underpinning, this car is ready for the modern road. For more information on this Cobra or how to register to place your bid click "
