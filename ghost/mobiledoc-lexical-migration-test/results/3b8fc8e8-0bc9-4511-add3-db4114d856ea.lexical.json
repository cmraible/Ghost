Sporting skis up front and tracks in the rear, the modifications are entirely necessary since Brinkerhoff will be driving 356 miles across Antarctica. Considering the continent has been growing lately, that’s not nearly enough to traverse the entire thing, but it’s plenty of rough traveling for a classic car.",
