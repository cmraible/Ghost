It really hurts me to say this, because bowling was the event I was looking forward to revisiting the most with this game, but now it’s the one I play the least. The amount of hassle to enjoyment has increasingly diminishing returns, especially since none of the other sports have these frustrating quirks. I really hope there’s a patch to at least address the temperamental release mechanic down the line, but as it is, I have a hard time having fun with bowling."
