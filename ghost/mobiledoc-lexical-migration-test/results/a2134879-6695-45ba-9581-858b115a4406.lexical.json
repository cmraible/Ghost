It takes little more than a simple google search to see the link between the fantastic pieces of automotive innovation we see today and the cars that came before them. The vehicles from the 1930s were prevalent for their ability to show off the driver's personality with wide fender flares and big V8 engines under the hood. That's precisely why these cars have amassed such a large following within the show car, racing, and daily driving community.
