Now, the De Tomaso uses a 427 V8 built by Blood Enterprises, featuring an aluminum block and heads as well as a 950CFM carb. After being built, this burly V8 was whipping out a nice 460-horsepower on the dyno, so you’ll definitely feel the difference. Backing up the engine is a rebuilt five-speed ZF transmission and a limited-slip differential."

Before it was refinished in the red PPG two-stage enamel you see now, this car was fitted with a Precision Pro-Formance Chassis Rigidity Kit, boosting handling considerably. Boosting aesthetics further was the replacement of the factory bumpers with Pre-L bumperettes which accentuate the body curves better. A quad-outlet exhaust system also gives a more aggressive look to the back end."
