Regarded as being so good that it was banned along with its slightly faster twin the Dodge Daytona. The fans just got bored watching the same two cars win every time, any car worthy of banning from NASCAR for being too fast is a car worth remembering. So naturally, someone went to work coming up with a rendering as a sort of monument to the car's insane history."
