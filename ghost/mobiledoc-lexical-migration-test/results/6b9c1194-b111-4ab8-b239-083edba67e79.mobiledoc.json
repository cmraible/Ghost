We also understand everyone might not be a fan of this rendering posted on Instagram by Sad Machines. The knee-jerk reaction might be disgust at the modifications to such a beautiful, unique, and timeless design beloved by many."

It’s an interesting mix of American and Japanese car culture. There are headlights from a TA40 Toyota Celica, taillights from a C210 Nissan Skyline, custom TRD Tosco wheels, and of course the towering Takeyari pipes towering out the of the rear like the spears of an invading foreign army."

If nothing else this car is unique, although actually doing this to a ’70 Plymouth ‘Cuda could spark some serious outrage."
