However, in Italy the government is much more chill as clearly illustrated by the response to Angelo Fregolent’s 1962 Lancia Fulvia being parked on the side of a public road in Conegliano for 47 years straight. That’s right, the car didn’t move and it didn’t have a huge stack of citations left under the wiper blade."

For 40 years he would unload his wares from the trunk right in front of the shop. For whatever reason, when the guy retired he and his wife decided to just leave the old Lancia parked there. There was a mystery surrounding who owned the car for the longest time and the legend spread, drawing in tourists who wanted to see the abandoned vehicle. As they snapped selfies with it and posted them on social media, more people flocked to Conegliano."
