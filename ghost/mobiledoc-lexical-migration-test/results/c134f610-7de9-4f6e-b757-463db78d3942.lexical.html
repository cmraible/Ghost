<p>Back in 2002 fewer than 200 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">Mustang enthusiasts</a> gathered in Myrtle Beach for the first Mustang Week. Obviously, the gathering of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-mustang-sedan-is-coming/">Ford pony car</a> fans has grown considerably since, with the gathering lasting all week. This year, which marks the 20th anniversary of Mustang Week, is expected to bring in thousands of people with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-dodge-charger-500s/">several planned activities</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>How well do you know the classic Ford Mustang? Test your knowledge <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Among the many activities planned for Mustang Week is a kickoff party, meet and greet, Mustangs and Coffee run, plus an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/white-1972-nova-shows-off/">autocross school</a>. That autocross school caters to drivers who are new to the sport as well as those with experience, with space in the sessions limited so people get more personal instruction time. </p>

<p>One of the other really exciting parts of the celebration is seeing the Ford Mustangs show off their performance at Darlington Dragway. The IHRA-sanctioned <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/street-racing-mustangs-power-pole/">quarter-mile dragstrip</a> will be used for a test-and-tune format, meaning drivers can take their car on as many runs as they’d like during the time so they can fine tune not only their vehicle but also their drag racing skills.</p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday is the capstone: a Car Show and Cruise In at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. Judges will examine the different rides on Friday and awards will officially be presented on Saturday.</p>

<p>Of course, people are showing up to Mustang Week for the Ford Mustangs, whether or not they’re showing off their own. However, many families have made attending a tradition since it also allows them to enjoy the spectacular South Carolina beaches at the same time.</p>
<p>If you can get to Myrtle Beach this week, you might be able to still get in on some of the Mustang Week action. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait until next year.</p>
