          " focuses more on sound, the lack of visual variety is painstakingly obvious. There are nice colour indicators drawn with a rough sketch-esque aesthetic which can certainly be praised for originality but when the backdrop and key objects remain the same throughout the game’s movie-length runtime, it begins to grow a little stale."

          "With a game based solely around the radio, its sound direction is quite possibly the most important aspect. The dialogue is what you are going to be focusing on the most and despite the occasionally awkward line delivery, each host and interviewee is engaging and entertaining to listen to. With a treble boost effect that replicates a classic AM radio frequency, the result is subtle but effective, helping to recreate the feeling of turning the dial back on ye olde antenna radios."
