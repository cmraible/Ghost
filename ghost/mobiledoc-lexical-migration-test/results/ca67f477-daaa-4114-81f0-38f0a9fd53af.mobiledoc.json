An e-mail arrives from one Kyle at *The Atlantic*, pointing me to the video they’ve produced following up an article about Rupert Murdoch and the future of newspapers – and providing a handy-dandy embed code for me.\n\nNow, given that I’m a subscriber to *The Atlantic*, and that the discussion is actually pretty interesting, how could I resist? Find out why Murdoch still thinks print is worth investing in:\n\n<object height=\"412\" width=\"486\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed flashvars=\"titleID=1591628379\" height=\"412\" src=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/images/issues/200801u/bcPlayer_singleTitle.swf?titleID=1591628379\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"486\"></embed></object>\n\nThe article, in all its glory, can be found [on *The Atlantic* site](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/murdoch).\n\n\n"
