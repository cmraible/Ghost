<p>Classic Chevrolet has been responsible for making an incredible number of iconic American muscle cars throughout the decades. The car community is abundant with stories of legendary cars like <a href="https://bid.wiregrassauctiongroup.com/ui/auctions/97006/11252030">the Corvette</a> or Chevelle ripping up the street and leaving its competition in the dust. Being a red-blooded American yourself, you too might want a little bit of the action these cars have to offer. So it would seem the obvious solution would be to pick yourself up your very own vintage Chevy. Alternatively, what's the harm in buying two?</p>

<p>One of those automobiles is a beautiful <a href="https://bid.wiregrassauctiongroup.com/ui/auctions/97006/11252030">1960 Chevrolet Corvette</a> from the very first generation those cars were ever produced. On the body, you'll find the stunning red and white two-tone that many have come to associate with the first-generation Corvette above all others. That striking visual posture combines with the 350 cubic inch crate motor V8 engine to make a truly inspiring Sports car. That powertrain is capable of pushing out 290 horsepower which might not seem a lot these days but is pretty hefty when you consider how lightweight the car is.</p>

<p>On the other side of the scale, you have a <a href="https://bid.wiregrassauctiongroup.com/ui/auctions/97006/11371413">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle</a> in a smooth orange and black color scheme. Much like the mentioned corvette, the Chevelle uses its paint job to pop out at anyone who sees it driving on the road. On top of that, under the hood is the L78 396 cubic inch ssv8 engine which was known for its high performance back in the day. This car was given a full restoration and fits perfectly with the Corvette as two prime examples of what made Chevy great in the first place.</p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself that the GM brand simply can't be beaten, but that's only because you haven't seen this <a href="https://bid.wiregrassauctiongroup.com/ui/auctions/97006/11252034">1969 Ford Bronco</a>. With its four wheel drive system and a V8 engine, the SUV quickly became  one of America’s most popular truck platforms. It also helps that this one has a three-speed Top Loader manual transmission that makes driving very fun even despite its age and size. These three vintage cars are perfect for anyone who likes a wide variety of classics which is exactly why you should consider them for your next automotive purchase.</p>
