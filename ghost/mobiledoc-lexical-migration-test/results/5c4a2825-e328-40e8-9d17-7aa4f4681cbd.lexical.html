<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Central to <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs mission is to ferret out corruption wherever it may lie, even when it is uncomfortable or goes against the expected narrative. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-pipeline-bill-gets-greenwashed/">Today‚Äôs featured article</a>, in its entirety below, confronts the reality of the Democrats‚Äô newly-released energy permitting bill.</p>
<p>The claimed positive climate impacts of this proposed legislation are being promoted by the misleadingly named American Clean Power Association. These claims are in turn being amplified by corporate media, giving cover to Democrats who wish to see the bill passed. However, simply following the money and the histories of the group‚Äôs board members immediately unearths clear conflicts of interest and points to the fact that the declarations being made by this group should not be taken at face value.</p>

<p>As Democrats <a href="__GHOST_URL__/permitting-reform-is-a-decoy-for-ramping-up-gas/">attempt</a> to depict their newly-released energy permitting bill as a climate ‚Äúwin,‚Äù they are being boosted by a ‚Äúclean power‚Äù lobbying group with ties to the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>The American Clean Power Association, which presents itself as the <a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/acp-ceo-heather-zichal-statement-on-house-passage-of-historic-inflation-reduction-act/">voice of clean energy</a> and is touting the bill as a way to boost renewables, is led by a former gas industry executive who had previously helped deregulate the industry as President Barack Obama‚Äôs energy advisor. Its board of directors also includes officials from electric and gas utilities that could be enriched by the legislation‚Äôs provisions to expedite fossil fuel pipelines.</p>
<p>Several prominent news outlets have already amplified the ‚Äúclean power‚Äù association‚Äôs recent <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22924635-acp_factsheet_permittingreform_final-revised">memo</a> ‚Äî which asserts that the legislation will ‚Äúunlock clean energy, American investment, and jobs while protecting the environment.‚Äù But few have scrutinized that claim, examined the group‚Äôs motivations, or mentioned that its members could benefit from the bill‚Äôs pro-fossil fuel provisions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA leading renewables trade group says that without permitting reform, roughly 100 gigawatts of clean energy expected to be deployed by 2030 is at risk of not being built,‚Äù a <em>New York Times</em> climate reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1572946410114527237">tweeted</a> Thursday, citing the American Clean Power Association‚Äôs memo pushing the legislation. The lobbying group‚Äôs estimate was also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b9ee24a-43a1-4d13-afbf-c8ea74c5d61a">cited</a> in a <em>Financial Times</em> article about the clean energy industry‚Äôs support for permitting reform, as well as referenced in other major media outlets.</p>
<p>While the association does include clean energy companies, it is also one of many conduits for fossil-fuel-reliant corporations to try to position themselves as part of a green future.</p>
<p>In Congress, those conglomerates that own and rely on fossil fuels are spearheading the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/to-save-the-planet-we-must-choose/">‚Äúall of the above‚Äù legislative strategy</a> embodied by the <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1555371478467706880">Inflation Reduction Act</a> and now adopted by the permitting deal, which would grant the president the power to designate 25 energy projects for quick federal approval. Both bills link clean and dirty power together as if they must grow in tandem, even as scientists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist">warn</a> that fossil fuel buildouts must end to stave off the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>The American Clean Power Association plays a key role in this ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù strategy. It is the environmentally friendly brand that sells permitting legislation as a climate victory by touting its benefits for clean energy interests ‚Äî without mentioning that the bill is first and foremost an oil and gas infrastructure bill that could benefit parts of their members‚Äô business that rely on fossil fuel.</p>

<p><strong>The ‚ÄúMiddle Ground‚Äù Fantasy</strong></p>
<p>The American Clean Power Association is led by Heather Zichal, a former natural gas executive who helped <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/08/07/joe-biden-climate-policy-advisers/">deregulate the</a><a href="https://www.desmog.com/2014/06/20/heather-zichal-former-obama-energy-aide-named-board-member-lng-exports-giant-cheniere/">gas industry</a> as part of the Obama administration, before receiving a <a href="https://readsludge.com/2019/05/10/bidens-climate-adviser-earned-1-million-from-natural-gas-company/">$1.1 million</a> payout as a board member at a natural gas conglomerate. As a climate adviser to President Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 presidential campaign, Zichal infamously declared that Biden <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-climate-exclusive/exclusive-presidential-hopeful-biden-looking-for-middle-ground-climate-policy-idUSKCN1SG18G">was seeking a</a> ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù on climate policy.</p>
<p>Zichal joined the American Clean Power Association in December 2020, shortly after Biden was elected. The association‚Äôs announcement of her hiring <a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/american-clean-power-association-names-heather-zichal-as-new-ceo/">said</a> she ‚Äúhas had a long career battling global climate change and brings deep experience in the public and private sector,‚Äù without noting what that private sector work entailed: a seat on the board at Cheniere Energy, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/magazine/us-export-liquid-natural-gas.html">revenues are reliant</a> on more domestic natural gas production for export across the globe.</p>
<p>Her website <a href="https://cleanpower.org/about/team/heather-zichal/">bio</a> similarly does not mention her past role with Cheniere Energy.</p>
<p>The association‚Äôs board of directors is also <a href="https://cleanpower.org/board/">stacked</a> with executives from electric and gas utilities that could benefit from the permitting bill‚Äôs measures to ram gas pipelines through the federal government‚Äôs approval process.</p>
<p>The most prominent example is an <a href="https://www.nexteraenergy.com/company/leadership.html">executive</a> from the utility giant NextEra Energy, which is leading the Mountain Valley Pipeline ‚Äî a project that would specifically be fast-tracked under the bill. The permitting measure was negotiated by coal baron Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who have together raked in <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/nextera-energy/recipients?id=D000000321">more than $340,000</a> in campaign contributions from NextEra since 2017.</p>
<p>The Manchin-Schumer permitting bill says the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which would run through Manchin‚Äôs home state, is necessary to ‚Äúreduce carbon emissions,‚Äù even though environmental groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/us/politics/manchin-pipeline-spending-bill.html">estimate</a> the pipeline will have the emissions equivalent of 23 coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association did not answer specific questions from <em>The Lever</em> about how it substantiates its claim that the pipeline bill will boost clean energy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was modeling done by our research and analytics team,‚Äù the spokesperson said, without providing further explanation.</p>
<p>Experts <a href="__GHOST_URL__/permitting-reform-is-a-decoy-for-ramping-up-gas/">disagree</a> on the extent to which the permitting legislation would actually unlock massive clean energy investments. An early draft of the legislation was <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/manchin-side-deal-text-lacks-mention-of-mountain-valley-pipeline/">emblazoned</a> with the watermark of the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas lobbying group.</p>

<p><strong>‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Have Any Interest In What Happens With These Natural Gas Pipelines‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>The American Clean Power Association has a web of ties to companies with a direct interest in passing legislation that speeds up the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure.</p>
<p>While some names on the association‚Äôs board work for renewable energy companies, the board includes executives from seven electric and gas utility companies, including NextEra, Duke, Dominion, Southern Power, Xcel Energy, American Electric Power, and Invenergy.</p>
<p>Duke Energy and Dominion Energy aimed to develop a natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, but <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/dominion-energy-and-duke-energy-cancel-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline">scrapped</a> the so-called Atlantic Coast Pipeline in 2020 due to costs and delays surrounding permits. The project, much like the Mountain Valley Pipeline, is one of several natural gas pipelines in recent years that won approval from federal regulators but failed to secure the necessary permits ‚Äî the exact type of project the Manchin-Schumer legislation aims to approve.</p>
<p>Duke Energy has also been pushing for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, as the company is <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2022/08/08/duke-energy-inflation-reduction-act-pipeline-deal.html">planning to build a fleet</a> of natural gas plants that would rely on the pipeline‚Äôs service.</p>
<p>Other American Clean Power Association members <a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/american-clean-power-overview.pdf">include</a> Bank of America, one of the biggest <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/how-much-the-largest-banks-have-invested-in-fossil-fuel-report.html">bank financiers</a> of fossil fuels; Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a holding company that owns utility, natural gas, and clean energy companies; and Google, <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/corporate-clean-energy-buying-tops-30gw-mark-in-record-year/">one of the largest</a> corporate purchasers of renewables that is also <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/could-googles-carbon-emissions-have-effectively-doubled-overnight">heavily invested</a> in fossil fuels.</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em> asked an American Clean Power Association spokesperson in an interview about how its members would benefit from fast-tracked pipeline approvals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any interest in what happens with these natural gas pipelines,‚Äù the spokesperson said, adding: ‚ÄúWe care about the deployment of clean energy.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Touting Transmission Lines, Downplaying Pipelines</strong></p>
<p>The American Clean Power Association argues that if Congress fails to enact Manchin and Schumer‚Äôs legislation, lawmakers will miss out on an opportunity to slash carbon emissions.</p>
<p>According to the lobbying group‚Äôs fact sheet, ‚ÄúFailure to act on permitting reform puts an estimated 100 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy projects at risk of significant delay, including over 40 GW of projects reliant on the siting and permitting of new transmission lines. These project delays would result in 550 million metric tons of additional carbon emissions this decade ‚Äî equivalent to the annual emissions of 88 coal-fired power plants.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rob Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies LLC, which conducts economic policy analysis of transmission and clean energy measures, told <em>The Lever</em> that the American Clean Power Association‚Äôs estimate is ‚Äúin the range of what‚Äôs reasonable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gramlich‚Äôs <a href="https://gridprogress.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/grid-strategies-siting-bill-analysis-2.pdf">own analysis</a> of the legislation found similar emissions reductions from the transmission provisions, but did not model the emissions impacts of the rest of the bill.</p>
<p>Still, there‚Äôs dispute over the extent to which the bill would actually unleash clean energy and transmission construction.</p>
<p>None of the research firms that analyzed the emissions impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act ‚Äî the energy and health care spending bill that passed in August ‚Äî have weighed in on the emissions impacts of this accompanying permitting reform bill. The head of one of those firms, Rhodium Group, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/manchin-permitting-reform-power-lines/671496/?utm_source=feed">said he thought</a> Gramlich was overestimating the reductions of the transmission provisions of the bill. (Rhodium has its own <a href="https://prospect.org/environment/problem-with-emission-reduction-models/">fossil fuel industry ties</a> and may have overestimated the positive impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act, according to reporting by <em>The American Prospect.)</em></p>
<p>While constructing transmission lines <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Transmission_2022-09-21.pdf">is essential</a> for connecting renewable energy resources like wind and solar to customers, and achieving emissions reductions, reforms to the approval process for transmission lines could be done through separate legislation.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders are planning to attach the permitting initiative to an unrelated spending bill that will need to pass by September 30, in order to avoid a government shutdown. Given opposition from <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/1573055918559924224?s=20&t=MzkPDH3qXlTkBPz3G1UnwQ">at least seven</a> Democratic Senate caucus members, the measure may need substantial Republican support to pass in the chamber and potentially in the House as well.On Thursday, Democrats scored their first Republican ‚Äúyes‚Äù vote on the matter, as Manchin‚Äôs home state counterpart, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, <a href="https://twitter.com/elwasson/status/1572979670139781121">announced</a> she would support the measure because it would fast-track the Mountain Valley Pipeline. No <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3656356-republicans-lining-up-against-manchins-permitting-reform-bill/">other Republicans</a> have said they will vote for the permitting bill.</p>
