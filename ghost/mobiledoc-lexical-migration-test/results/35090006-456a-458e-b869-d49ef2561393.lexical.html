</div> Bit of a naughty photo this one, grabbed through the windshield of my car as I drove home from Suffolk this morning.<p></p>
<p>Why? Well, I was just enjoying not commuting the normal London route for once, and enjoying seeing the view from the A12 in daylight. I seem to see it at night most of the time, and it really does pass through an attractive part of the world, despite its flatness. (I’m a hills-and-trees guy at heart)</p>
<p>Anyway, there you have it: today’s one-off alternative commute.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
