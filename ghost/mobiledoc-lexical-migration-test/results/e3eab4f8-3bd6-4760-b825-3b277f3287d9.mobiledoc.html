<p>It's clear we're about to go through a reassessment of how journalists should behave on social media — and Twitter in particular. This came up in passing during the discussion about the <em>Reuters Institute Digital News Report</em> yesterday, and is in the news again today:</p>

<p>I've had a couple of interesting discussions about the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/06/resuters-digital-news-report-2020/">collapse in trust in journalism</a> over the past 24 hours, and one of the (many) causes several people pinpointed was the blurring of news and opinion both in publications, but especially on social media. </p>
<p>This doesn't have to be the case. There are several journalists I admire — and, in some cases, know personally — whose politics are a mystery to me. They maintain an active and useful social media presence without joining in the open political warfare that exists on Twitter. </p>
<p>And then there are people like <a href="https://twitter.com/OwenJones84?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Owen Jones</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/tomhfh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tom Harwood</a> who are far more polemicists than journalists in the traditional sense. The solution lies far more with the "political blank states" than it does with the political outriders, and it's important we have this conversation right now. </p>
<p>The damage this is doing to the reputation of journalism as a profession needs addressing. And it's making social media an ever-more toxic environment for all journalists. </p>

<p>Probably only a surprise to journalists, who have an obsession with Twitter out of all proportion to its actual userbase, but this key finding from the Digital News Report ought to be informing more audience engagement strategies than it is. </p>

<p>Esther digs deep into the podcast section of the Digital News Report, and finds things like this:</p>
<blockquote>With half of all respondents saying that podcasts provide more depth and understanding than other types of media, the opportunities for publishers looking to engage their audiences on a deeper level have never been clearer.</blockquote>
