<p>First up we have a rusty Ford pickup truck hot rod, although it is not certain what model the vehicle is, the distinct sound of a monster V8 can be heard as he floors it down the street. Ferrari is the pinnacle of success in the car world, the first car most of us think of when we picture our best life is either a Ferrari or a car inspired by one. This is best embodied through our next entry on the list, a Ferrari 348 GTB. Singhania has an affinity for high horsepower V8s because along with the HotRod and Ferrari he also has several American V8 muscle machines at his disposal including a 1973 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and one Ford Mustang modified for the drag strip. Finally, the boastful billionaire has also been spotted driving a Mercedes-Benz 540K Cabriolet, which can be seen with the top down enjoying the finer things in life.</p>
