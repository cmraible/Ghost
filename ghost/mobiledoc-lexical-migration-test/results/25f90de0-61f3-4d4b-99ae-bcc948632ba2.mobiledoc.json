Machowiak says he’s going to invest in some surveillance cameras, thinking that will stop future thefts. However, we’ve posted quite a few videos of car thieves at work, so cameras don’t seem to deter many these days. After all, they likely will spend little time incarcerated for their crimes, if they’re even caught."

Placing your keys inside a Faraday cage at night is an excellent idea since that will block the signal entirely. Even better, if you’re able to park your vehicle in a garage, do so. To add even more security, lock the garage door since openers can also be fairly easily defeated."
