In fact, Atlantic Beach police clerk Kim Mujas told the media, “We don’t want them here.” That’s pretty clear-cut, even though in years past the city has been very welcoming to bikers and their dollars. However, as mentioned before, the city has officially canceled its Bikefest, known as Black Bike Week, two years in a row, making it clear that keeping the city COVID-19 safe is more of a priority. However, Mujas did also say, “We hope by next year we can open up full swing, but not this year.” The song and dance about there’s always next year has been going on for over a year now, and it appears some haven’t tired of it yet.",
