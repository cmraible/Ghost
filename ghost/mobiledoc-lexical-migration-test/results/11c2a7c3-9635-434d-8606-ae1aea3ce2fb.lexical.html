<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">Mopar</a> has been crushing the competition lately with its modern muscle cars but there is still nothing like the <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">1969-½ 'lift-off' hood Super Bee</a>. The problem is that there are very few to go around and only 153 1969-½ year models with the A-12 performance package were even made. Before you give up on this seemingly unattainable dream car though, imagine if you were to be able to win a fully restored example with only 27,000 original miles on the clock. Now you can. Dream Giveaway is now giving Motorious readers the opportunity to <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">bring this </a>limited-edition muscle car home.</p>
<blockquote><em>Motorious readers can get more tickets <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>

<p>This extremely rare car was fully restored by a national Super Bee expert and features all of its original A19 Package parts. This includes the fiberglass lift-off hood, a 390-horespower 440 Six-Pack engine and a Dana 60 rear axle with 4.10 rear gears. It also features a no-nonsense interior, a Police handling package, and 15x6 Black H.D. wheels. For the purist, the restoration also included a reproduction set of G70x15 Redline tires.</p>
