The package included the 400-cubic-inch Ram Air III engine producing 366 horsepower, Rally II wheels without the regular GTO's trim rings, a Hurst shifter with a unique T-shaped handle, wider tires, Judge decals, and a rear spoiler. This example is painted in the Judge's iconic Carousel Red exterior color with a Parchment interior, as well."
