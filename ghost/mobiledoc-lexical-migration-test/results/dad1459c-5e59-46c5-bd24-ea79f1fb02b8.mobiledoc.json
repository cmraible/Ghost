The bike could even pop wheelies continuously, still allowing the rider to steer and make sharp turns (don’t ask us how that even makes sense).

To show he could make a meaningful contribution, Nebicher create a crime-solving artificial intelligence with all the positive attributes he would think of, then it came to life and manifested in the real world as Automan. Together with the Tinkerbell-like Cursor, this Tron-esque crime fighter takes on bad guys with an impressive array of computer-generated devices and a seemingly never-ending array of superpowers."
