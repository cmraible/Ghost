<p>During a 2019 speech about economic rights, Bernie Sanders <a href="https://psmag.com/ideas/bernies-big-speech-was-about-freedom">said</a>: “Freedom is an often-used word, but it’s time we took a hard look at what that word actually means. Ask yourself: what does it actually mean to be free?”</p>
<p>That question is particularly pressing today, as the push to reopen the economy is cast as a liberation movement. In their telling, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/18/coronavirus-scenes-of-protests-across-the-country-demanding-states-reopen-the-economy.html">conservative activists</a> say employers must be given the <em>freedom</em> to ignore scientific warnings and resume business as usual.</p>
<p>And yet, lifting stay-at-home orders is actually an assault on a core freedom – the freedom to protect oneself and one’s family from a lethal disease, without being bankrupted.</p>
<p>A system that aimed to protect that freedom would provide the same <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/citi-raises-sp-500-forecast-citing-incessant-fed-support.html">“incessant Fed support”</a> to workers as it is already providing to Wall Street banks. But America has constructed policies that actively try to deprive workers of that freedom and instead force them out into a deadly pandemic, under threat of being economically destroyed.</p>
<p>In locales across the country, millions of Americans are losing employer-based healthcare coverage, and can only get it back if they go back to their jobs as infection rates increase.</p>
<p>In various states, officials are ending eviction moratoriums because “people generally should be back at work,” as <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_burness/status/1284204484218912769?s=21">Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis</a>, put it in a declaration saying the quiet part aloud.</p>
<p>In Washington, Donald Trump is trying to brush aside dire warnings and force open schools. Republican governors like <a href="https://twitter.com/stltoday/status/1285199041417158663?s=20">Missouri’s Mike Parson</a> are supporting him by declaring that if kids “do get Covid-19, which they will, and they will when they go to school, they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it” – a formula for spreading the virus from children to entire families.</p>
<p>In Congress, Republican lawmakers are <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/507836-senate-gop-proposing-five-year-shield-from-coronavirus-lawsuits">threatening</a> to slash existing unemployment benefits. They are also aiming to shield employers from the threat of lawsuits if and when their profit-maximizing business practices end up making workers sick – a move that “would make it nearly impossible to sue corporations for Covid-19-related legal claims by workers [and] give employers a free pass to flout worker safety laws”, as two Congressional Progressive Caucus staffers recently <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/mcconnell-corporate-liability-covid.html">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/virus-unemployment-fired.html">reports</a> of businesses <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3zd9g/whole-foods-just-fired-an-employee-who-kept-track-of-coronavirus-cases">firing</a> workers who raise concerns over Covid – and a court <a href="https://www.law360.com/publicpolicy/articles/1282136">rebuffed</a> a lawsuit aiming to force the Trump labor department to issue new rules requiring employers to protect workers from the disease.</p>
<p>This isn’t happenstance or random. It is all part of a plan.</p>
