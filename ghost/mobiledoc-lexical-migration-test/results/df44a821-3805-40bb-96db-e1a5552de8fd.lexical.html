<p>The <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray">2020 Chevrolet Corvette</a> is proving to be one of the highest-demand vehicles to be launched in recent years, and the skyrocketing resale values are proof of that.

<p>While the actual <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray">C8 Corvette Stingray being given away</a> may vary from the car shown in these pictures, it will look very similar including the Elkhart Lake Blue Metallic paint job and staggered (19-inch front, 20-inch rear) five-spoke Carbon Flash-painted aluminum wheels wrapped with sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber. The exterior is finished off with a high-wing Carbon Flash rear spoiler and an exposed carbon fiber ground effects kit, while the interior features black leather with GT2 bucket seats and carbon fiber trim.</p>
<p>The Z51 is powered by a 6.2-liter LT2 V8 engine cranking out 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque allowing this Corvette to rocket from 0-60 mph in just 2.9 seconds. As if this mid-mounted engine didn't look good enough framed by the rear window, this car also adds the Engine Appearance Package. The Z51 Package gives this aggressive Corvette a sportier suspension tune, large Brembo brakes, an electronic limited-slip differential, sport exhaust and more.</p>
