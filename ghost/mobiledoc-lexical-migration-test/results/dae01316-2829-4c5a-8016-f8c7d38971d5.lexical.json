After all, it has a robust front fairing with a nice, tall windshield and wind deflectors, plus BMW says there are additional headlights for traveling on unlit backroads. To add even more comfort into the mix, there’s a Marshall sound system and a heated seat, which oddly sounds nice, although heated handlebar grips would also be great. Flashier than the Bagger, the Transcontinental has plenty of chrome and other brightwork.",
