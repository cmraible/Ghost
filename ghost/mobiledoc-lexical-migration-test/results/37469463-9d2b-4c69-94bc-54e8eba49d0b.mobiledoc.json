Its appearance certainly was impressive, so it makes sense why it would have such a commanding screen presence. However, the strategy over time shifted more toward what some believe to be the inevitable nature of an autonomous future."

However, the tingly feels don’t pay the bills. Plus, there are some serious kinks in autonomous tech Local Motors and others would have to work through, things which aren’t exactly cheap. We don’t know if that’s why the company is done, but it very well could be."

Employees have taken to social media to spread the news, but until we hear it from Local Motors through official channels, there’s still a slight chance it’s little better than a rumor. In fact, some claimed the company would be shuttered by January 14. That said, it’s unlikely Local Motors isn’t closing, so it’s best to just be prepared for the worst."
