<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It’s been a crazy week of scoops and new subscriber-only products for supporters of <em>The Daily Poster.</em> I’m so thrilled we launched The Midday Poster - look for it in your inbox next week.</p>
<p>I’m not sure exactly what the schedule for The Midday Poster will be — we are debating whether or not to do it every day or every other day. It’s a matter of resources, and we’re mindful of not overloading your email box. If you have thoughts on that, let us know — but I can tell you that we got a great response from the first one this week (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-devos-family-rakes/">which you can read here</a>). As you can see, we are trying to provide our supporting subscribers with as much special content as we can, as a thanks to you for making our journalism possible.</p>
<p>We are entering a very tumultuous political moment — we are already seeing that many liberal groups and Democratic politicians are preemptively standing down as the prospective Biden administration prepares to take power. Here at <em>The Daily Poster</em> we aren’t standing down — we are going to continue doing what we always do: hold public officials accountable, regardless of party.</p>
<p>I am mindful that a lot of what we publish can seem “negative,” because we are exposing corruption, fraud and abuse. I don’t want to bum everyone out with our reporting, but I also feel it is our responsibility to report the news, even if it isn’t pleasant. It’s a dirty job, but someone has to do it!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a big announcement in the next few days about our next live chat, which will be on Wednesday 12/9 at 7:30pm ET. We have a great guest that I’ll be telling you about soon — so save the date!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
