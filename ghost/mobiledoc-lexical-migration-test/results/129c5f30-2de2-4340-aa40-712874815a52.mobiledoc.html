<hr>
<p>We've all seen some pretty sad sights for classic cars as many have either been thrown to the masses of part hungry enthusiasts or abandoned entirely. Countless Chevelles, Novas, and Camaros, have been left to rot over the years, making for a flooded market of long-dead muscle cars. Despite being pretty easy to find, frequently cheap to get running, and doubling or tripling in value after restoration, many find it hard to justify purchasing one of these forgotten legends. So it would seem the natural destiny of these cars to slowly wither away like paper in water, at least for most of them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Check out guys rolling down the road on Sea Doos <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sea-doos-cruise-road/">here</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>This was the case for this particular 1961 Chevrolet Bel Air Bubble Top, which had been sitting in an abandoned forest for decades without maintenance. Years of abandonment had turned this legend into a car not suitable for the open road making for an increasingly tricky project. Restoring this car would be an insane challenge, but that is precisely what this group of car guys wanted to do. So they began pulling it from its wood and grassy grave so that it may drive once again with the best of them.</p>
<p>After clearing out some of the trees that impeded removing the old performance icon, it was time to hook the car up to a Bobcat. Finally, they connected the Bobcat to the front spindles and pulled the vehicle out of its open position. Getting the car out of the space wasn't too bad, but the mechanical side of things proved to be a wildly extensive endeavor. Eventually, the guys could get the car up and running through the car was barely staying on most of the time. This car actually had a V8 engine, which is stunning considering the condition, but overall this car is likely to turn out great over the coming years, and we are certainly excited to see it do so.</p>
