<p>Since the release of Steamworld Dig 2 in August, Image & Form have been very quiet. However in a Happy New Year video, CEO Brjánn Sigurgeirsson says that the company will have some news for us very soon. He later ended the video stating, “see you sooner than you think?”</p>

<p>We haven’t seen anything from Image & Form since they partnered with fellow Swedish developer, Zoink Games, so this announcement may be a big one!</p>
