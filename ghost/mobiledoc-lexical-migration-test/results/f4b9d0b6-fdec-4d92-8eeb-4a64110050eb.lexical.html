<p>Taking cues from <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-morgan-aero-8-10/">British sports cars</a> of the 1930s, Morgan Motor Company has brought the style into the modern era. With long sweeping body lines, large front grills, and round headlights, styling has remained largely unchanged from the very beginning. Likewise, the manufacturing process has also endured as each of its cars are largely hand built and as unique as a modern car can be. Its craftsmen currently build around 800 specially ordered cars per year by hand, offering an alternative to the modern mass production <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-morgan-aero-8-10/">sports car</a>. </p>

<p>In 2005, Morgan made <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-morgan-aero-8-10/">this Morgan Aero 8</a> specifically for an unnamed buyer. It features aluminum bodywork atop a bonded aluminum chassis and is finished in Mercedes-Benz Beryll Metallic paint. Inside is Yarwood Sahara leather upholstery accented by Ash wood trim. An engine-turned dashboard holds white-face gauges, an air conditioner, and a Sony CD stereo. Other appointments include power windows and a manually operated soft top.
