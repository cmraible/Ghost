<p>Good things are happening! For starters, ahead of the midterms, Biden is taking some steps (although not nearly enough) to change his position on cannabis policy. What’s more, young Americans are taking the labor movement’s message to heart, a new act in California rolls back the harmful effects of criminal records, workers have a new tool in salary negotiations, and researchers have found that embracing basic food waste practices could have major impacts on the climate crisis.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em>, available for supporting subscribers below.</p>
<h3 id="biden-somewhat-flips-his-script-on-cannabis">Biden (Somewhat) Flips His Script On Cannabis</h3>
<p>On Thursday, President Joe Biden — a <a href="https://fee.org/articles/joe-biden-the-architect-of-america-s-disastrous-war-on-drugs/">leading architect</a> of the war on drugs — <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/">announced</a> steps his administration will be taking to address the disastrous effects of mass incarceration and mandatory sentencing laws, which have predominantly targeted Black and Brown communities.</p>
<p>After years of <a href="https://fee.org/articles/joe-biden-the-architect-of-america-s-disastrous-war-on-drugs/">shaping</a> mass incarceration policy in the ’80s and ’90s, Biden is now <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1578097880744820736?s=20&t=X48wlHiomXCpBVYuCuLCkw">saying</a>, “Sending people to jail for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives — for conduct that is legal in many states.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Biden <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/biden-announces-mass-marijuana-pardons-and-calls-for-cannabis-scheduling-review/">plans</a> to pardon all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, which would help remove barriers for those with records to employment, housing, and educational opportunities. While the sentiment matters, in reality not a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/us/politics/biden-marijuana-pardon.html">single</a><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/10/06/background-press-call-on-marijuana-reform/">person</a> is currently in federal prison for “simple marijuana possession,” meaning Biden’s pardons will actually largely benefit people convicted under District of Columbia drug laws. Furthermore, the announcement <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/">specifies</a> that the pardons would not apply to convicted “non-citizens.”</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1578176831726882816?t=skkgkH9G7Q3lLXYyE1yRow&s=19">tweeted</a> that criminal marijuana records must also be expunged as part of the country’s decriminalization efforts. That’s because <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-marijuana-records-would-be-expunged-under-new-bipartisan-congressional-bill/">expungement</a> would treat marijuana convictions as if they never occurred, and fully remove barriers created by those records.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>Biden is also calling on state governors to make pardons and is directing Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra to look into rescheduling cannabis so it is no longer on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, which would mean that marijuana could be more readily researched for medical usage and potentially no longer serve as basis for criminalization under federal law.</p>

<h3 id="young-people-are-embracing-unions">Young People Are Embracing Unions</h3>
<p>As the uptick in strikes in October — recently dubbed Striketober — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/26/striketober-unions-strikes-us-october">makes</a><a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-striketober">headlines</a> and new workplaces launch unionization efforts every week, the Center for American Progress just <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gen-z-most-pro-union">released</a> a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-closing-gender-education-and-ideological-divides-behind-gen-zs-union-movement/">new report</a> on generational “pro-union sentiment.” Gen Z, which includes people 23 years old and younger as of 2020, is more pro-union than nearly every other generation measured.</p>
<p>According to the report, “Members of Gen Z are entering the workforce at a time of growing economic uncertainty, as college degrees no longer promise job stability and young people describe high levels of economic anxiety.”</p>
<p>On average, 64 percent of Gen Z members approve of unions, compared to 61 percent of millennials. These findings build upon 2021 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/03/majorities-of-americans-say-unions-have-a-positive-effect-on-u-s-and-that-decline-in-union-membership-is-bad/">research</a> conducted by Pew Research Center, which found that 69 percent of Americans between ages 18-29 reported feeling that “labor unions have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country,” compared with 55 percent of adults across the board.</p>
<h3 id="california-becomes-latest-state-to-require-salary-transparency">California Becomes Latest State To Require Salary Transparency</h3>
<p>Last week, California <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/california-pay-transparency-law-to-require-salary-ranges-on-job-postings.html">became</a> the latest state to pass a pay disclosure act, <a href="https://synd.io/blog_post/us-pay-transparency-legislation-cheat-sheet/">joining</a> New York, Washington, Colorado, and several states with similar rules. The new law will require roughly 200,000 companies with at least 15 employees to start disclosing pay ranges on any in-state job postings.</p>
<p>Building on a 2020 <a href="https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/law-and-policy-group/california-requires-employers-to-file-equal-pay-reports.html?bsrc=mercer">mandate</a> targeting wage disparities, companies with more than 100 employees <a href="https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/show-me-money-california-enacts-new-pay-disclosure-requirements">must now</a> publicly report pay data for their employees and contractors by race, ethnicity, and gender. Such salary transparency helps workers avoid getting <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-09-13/california-new-york-pay-transparency">lowballed</a> in salary negotiations.</p>
<p>“Women, and especially women of color, are literally being robbed of wages every year,” said Jessica Ramey Stender, policy director for Equal Rights Advocates, an advocacy group that co-sponsored the salary bill. “That is money that could go to rent, food, diapers, education, retirement savings. So the time has really come for robust pay equity legislation here in California and beyond.”</p>
<h3 id="eliminating-food-waste-would-slash-carbon-emissions">Eliminating Food Waste Would Slash Carbon Emissions</h3>
<p>A new report finds that zero-waste practices as <a href="https://grist.org/regulation/report-eliminating-waste-is-a-climate-solution/">straightforward</a> as composting could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions released from global waste by <a href="https://grist.org/regulation/report-eliminating-waste-is-a-climate-solution/">as much</a> as 85 percent, roughly the equivalent of eliminating all cars in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an anti-waste <a href="https://www.no-burn.org/">initiative</a>, released the report that found that the responsible management of organic waste like food scraps and grass clippings — decomposing matter that releases tons of methane — could have an immense impact on the climate crisis. According to the report, food waste is responsible for nearly <a href="https://updates.panda.org/driven-to-waste-report">10 percent</a> of climate pollution.</p>
<p>The report examines how municipal efforts to separate food scraps and compost from other waste could reduce urban methane emissions in landfills by 62 percent. Already Seoul, South Korea, seperates 96 percent of its organic waste.</p>
<h3 id="millions-of-criminal-records-to-be-sealed">Millions Of Criminal Records To Be Sealed</h3>
<p>Millions of Californians will get to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-will-let-millions-of-past-offenders-17477110.php">seal</a> criminal records from public view after <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB731">new legislation</a> was signed into law last week. Because of the far reach of the carceral system, nearly eight million Californians, or 1 in 5 state residents, have a record of past arrest or conviction.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/gift_subscription#/" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Give A Gift Subscription</a></div>
<p>These records trap millions into poverty and systematically prevent people from seeking basic rights to employment, education, housing, and other basic benefits.</p>
<p>“California now has the most comprehensive record-sealing system in the nation,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/14/criminal-records-california-sealing-expunge-jay-jordan">Jay Jordan</a>, leader of the Alliance for Safety and Justice, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-will-let-millions-of-past-offenders-17477110.php">told</a> the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>. He added that people with records will be “freed from the thousands of counterproductive yet permanent restrictions.”</p>
