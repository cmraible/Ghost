            "text": ", it's time to talk about how hardcore American trucks are again. With a focus on versatility, American trucks have become a lot simpler for the driver. If you want to get the best fuel economy while driving through the city you turn a knob. Extreme off-roading it? Simply turn the knob the other way. Climbing a 30-degree incline is no problem and with Hill Descent Assist, coming down is just as effortless. All of these electronics and semi-autonomous features can really make you wonder how off-roaders made it before the modern era. For those that don’t remember having to get out and manually lock the hubs before climbing a hill, TFLClassics took a trip back to 1989 to test out their Ford F350 truck, Gunsmoke.",

In the meantime, the crew took the truck up to the Colorado mountains to see just how capable it is. What they found out is that the trucks Ford used to make in 1989 were more akin to tractors. In fact, with this truck’s manually locked hubs, super large displacement diesel engine, and incredibly low first gear, it didn’t need any input at all from the driver past releasing the clutch to climb the hill. How’s that for semi-autonomous?",
