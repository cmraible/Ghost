<p>There’s no doubt the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-jeep-grand-wagoneer/">Hellcat V8</a> is a wondrous engine which can improve just about any vehicle, whether a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-jeep-grand-wagoneer/">not</a>. That’s the kind of thinking that goes behind dropping the 707-horsepower engine in a 1970 Plymouth Sport Satellite. Just to make sure everyone’s on the same page with what’s going on, the supercharger peeks out through a cutout in the hood. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-nissan-240sx/">Show ‘em if you got ‘em, right</a>?</p>

<p>Weaver Customs, a shop in Utah, was the mastermind behind this clean and intriguing build. Most people wouldn’t even begin to think of the Sport Satellite as a muscle machine, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-maverick-drag/">and that’s partly what makes it so fun</a>. Dropping a Hellcat in a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-hot-wheels/">Dodge Challenger</a> or Charger is expected and has been done plenty.</p>

<p>Because there aren’t a lot of people customizing Plymouth Sport Satellites, Weaver Customs had to fabricate a good many of the parts on this car. That made the build more challenging, although the final payoff is that much sweeter.</p>

<p>In fact, the shop had to fabricate the hood, front spoiler, rocker panels, and side ducts using metal. There’s a mesh grille painted black with two brushed ram air intakes next to the LED headlights, giving a modernized vibe to this restomod.</p>

<p>For good measure, Weaver Customs decided to push the Hellcat V8 to the next level. Apparently 707-hp is just a little too watered down. Thanks to some tuning, it’s pushing about 900-hp. Sending that power to the Ford 9-inch rear axle is a six-speed transmission. A custom chassis complete with Scotts Hotrods front suspension and a four-link rear suspension helps provide the kind of torsional rigidity necessary to handle the punishment a tuned Hellcat dishes out. Wilwood disc brakes also help maintain performance balance.</p>
