You choose to play in one of six arenas and are pitted against one of the five other teams (of your choice); and then the chaos begins. Each match lasts three, four or five minutes depending on what you choose, plus overtime if required. Obviously, the target is to score more goals than your opponent, however you can get up to some dastardly tricks to make this easier for yourself."

The AI is very, very frustrating; the game resembles a bunch of real-life five year olds playing football; you know, when they just put their head down and run towards the ball. Every time I watch little kids play football, they just all run after the ball in one massive herd (no offence to any five year olds reading this), and the same thing happens here. Even the players on your own team seem to run around aimlessly, which means you’re often left with no one defending the goal through no fault of your own. "

The poor AI just exacerbates this because these two issues together make for a pretty samey experience and you just find yourself button mashing hoping that the ball heads in the right direction.
