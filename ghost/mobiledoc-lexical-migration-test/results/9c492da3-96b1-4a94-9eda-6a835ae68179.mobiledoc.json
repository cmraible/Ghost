          "If there's anything the last few years of rampant crime and Armageddon-like chaos on the street have taught us, the cops need some severe help dealing with criminals. While the police were once respected among communities of law-abiding citizens and feared by criminals, the institutions to protect and serve have become a laughing stock. Whether this is because of the cops themselves, the recent lack of respect for law enforcement, or just a lack of funding, it's clear that the police require a total brand overhaul. So the first step on the journey to reclaim their reputation for catching the bad guys and saving the day is to reshape their image; this might be the perfect way to start. There's more than just "

          "The first thing you typically see when confronted with the long arm of the law is the cop cars swarming around you like a pack of wolves. Once, the infamous Dodge Charger pursuit halted criminals and amazed pedestrians, but there was a huge problem. The Chargers used by cops are either heavy 5.7-liter V8 or low-power V6s, making it difficult for anyone with a basic knowledge of cars to be afraid to run. Of course, those vehicles have the advantage of AWD, but there's another all-American performance car whose reputation is quite vibrant within cop culture. That car is the Ford Mustang."

Nowadays, Steeda has introduced a new Mustang deemed the Special Services Mustang for the Valdosta Police department. Along with the V8 engine, the cops have been given a bright white and blue livery, suspension upgrades, a tune, and a cold air intake. This all translates to a great performance car and the perfect vehicle to help the police reclaim their image of skill, honor, and general toughness in the face of adversity."
