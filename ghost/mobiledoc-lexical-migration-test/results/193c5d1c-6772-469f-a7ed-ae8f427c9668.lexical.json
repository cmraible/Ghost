Price, Jr., 30, of Houston, Texas; and Julian Callahan, 24, of  Katy, Texas were all arrested for receiving stolen property after  police had staked out the three cars and just waited for the men to  return. As the picture shows, all three cars were all backed into  adjacent parking spots, which must have looked suspicious enough, making  it easy for police to spot the cars. Officers then just had to wait for  the men to return to the cars, and as soon as they tried to make entry,  they were all taken into custody. As it turns out, these vehicles had  been stolen from a dealership in Texas, and while it's unclear what, if  any, damage happened to the cars, all three have been returned to Texas;  it's also unclear whether these were dealer-owned vehicles or customer  cars.",
