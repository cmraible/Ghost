In fact, the exterior and even the Oyster leather interior are next to flawless. A mere 213 miles show on this Chevy, which has been stored with great care for the past four-plus decades. This might be the lowest-mileage, cleanest Silver Anniversary models in existence today. It spent time in a climate-controlled room and was on display at the Corvette Museum for the grand opening in 1994. Documentation from the museum will be included in the sale, setting this car apart from other 1978 Corvettes."
