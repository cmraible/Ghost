With four doors, only a slightly aggressive design, and an unsuspecting base model,  the G8 wasn't really thought of much in its day. However, nowadays we can clearly see that it may very well have been the fastest production vehicle to ever roll off the Pontiac factory floor. If you need an example of that, here's a race that showcases the greatness of the GXP package as the car is pinned up against another incredibly fast classic muscle car.",
