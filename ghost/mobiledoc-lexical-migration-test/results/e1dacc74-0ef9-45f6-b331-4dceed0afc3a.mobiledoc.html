<p>The Macomb Auto Theft Squad has been after a team of Thieves for quite some time concerning the loss of three high-value classic cars. The victim, Michael's Auto Sales, reported a 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dead-chevy-camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro,</a> a 1986 Buick Regal, and a 1986 Buick Grand National from his property. The 1969 Camaro is a particularly interesting one because it didn't take long for the authorities to find it. Rather, it was not even that far away from the dealership and was left unoccupied. This has led a lot of people to many questions regarding what kind of person steals three classic cars and leaves one of them so obviously close to the crime scene with no trace of the other two cars.</p>

<p>After some research, MATS found the Grand National at the Detroit <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/detroit-autorama-has-been-canceled/">Autorama </a>event last month. On top of that, the man responsible for the vehicle said he was selling it for a measly $10,000. when further pushed, it turned out that he didn't have the title and the car was nowhere in sight leading authorities to believe they had drawn a dead end. Of course, that didn't stop them from pursuing this particular Outlet further and what they found was rather shocking. First, they figured out who this guy was In the chase.</p>
<p>In the very home that this man was said to be connected to via a family member, they set up a car that looked similar to the Grand National that got stolen. Indeed, this seemed to be the very vehicle and the authorities were quick to jump on this opportunity. On top of that, the Buick Regal was found in a parking lot of a church in the Lincoln Park area. Needless to say, an arrest warrant is in progress for the man behind all of this mystery and hopefully, justice will be served soon enough.</p>
