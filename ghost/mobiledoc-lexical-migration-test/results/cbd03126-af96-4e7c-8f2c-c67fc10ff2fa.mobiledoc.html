We can't say we have, either.</h3>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/story-reunited-with-old-car/">Fans of older</a> Mercedes-Benz models often cite their rugged durability and reliability as a major reason why they love them. Someone took <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-steal-c8-corvette/">that rugged theme</a> a step further with this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-hot-rod-stretches-legs/">wild custom creation</a>.</p>

<p>While browsing Facebook Marketplace for weird cars (we love our job sometimes), we hit the mother lode. We found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/3326801320739192/">this 2000 Mercedes-Benz E320</a> offered for sale at a dealer in Tifton, Georgia.</p>
<p>You've probably already noticed that this isn't your average E Class. For most, a station wagon would be more than enough extra utility to handle day to day errands. For the dealer that commissioned this thing, that simply wasn't enough.</p>

<p>The trunk/hatch area of this E320 was replaced by a respectably large (by, say, El Camino standards) pickup bed, and the entire creation sits atop a stretched chassis. According to the listing, it was custom built in Germany for a Mercedes-Benz dealer in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>It started life as a station wagon (estate) model, before being sent to Binz Karosserie. There, 29 inches – over two and a half feet – were added to the car's overall length. The conversion apparently cost in the neighborhood of $50,000 back in 2000.</p>

<p>Once it was stateside, it was used for promotion by the dealer before being sold into private hands. With just under 23,000, it still looks more or less like a new car, albeit a very unusual one.</p>
<p>If you want to add this unusual <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1964-mercedes-benz-230-sl/">Mercedes-Benz</a> to your collection, or you are an independent shop that specializes in German cars, you can now own this one-of-a-kind E Class for just under $60,000. It'd make for a perfect parts chaser for you other projects.</p>
