<p>Conservative Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who is leading the effort to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, recently sent an email soliciting constituent feedback “to ensure that I’m focusing on the right things.” But the included survey suggests Gottheimer might not really care what his constituents think about his pet issue.</p>

<p>Conservative Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer recently sent an email to his constituents noting that, “As the Co-Chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus and founder of the new bipartisan SALT Caucus, I’m working hard every day to find solutions to the biggest issues facing Americans — but I want to ensure that I’m focusing on the right things.”</p>
<p>The email linked to <a href="https://go.josh4congress.com/a/welcome-survey-2021?refcode2=e086fa65-c0b8-eb11-a7ad-501ac57ba3ed&refcode=JG_EM_WELCOME_2021&emci=b89a38ef-d1ad-eb11-85aa-0050f237abef&emdi=e086fa65-c0b8-eb11-a7ad-501ac57ba3ed&ceid=30514982">an online survey</a> that included a question on repealing the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, an effort that Gottheimer is helping to lead:</p>
<p>“President Biden’s next goal is to tackle American infrastructure and uplift the middle class. Do you believe that the SALT tax deduction must be lifted to uplift the middle class?”</p>
<p>The survey provided three possible responses: “Yes, definitely,” “I’m not sure,” and “I need more information.”</p>
<p>“No” was not an option.</p>
<p>The survey resembled former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-approval-poll-offers-no-negative-options/">notorious 2017 approval poll</a>, which didn’t provide respondents a way to give a negative response.</p>
<p>Eliminating the SALT cap would be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly/">a huge tax break</a> for wealthy homeowners — one Gottheimer would personally benefit from, along with other members of the so-called SALT Caucus. As <em>The Daily Poster</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/democrats-gunning-to-end-salt-cap-stand-to-benefit/">previously reported</a>, Gottheimer owns property in New Jersey valued at $1,997,900, according to state property records. His tax bill on the property was $35,603 this year, indicating he would see a big tax break if the SALT cap was eliminated.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, Gottheimer’s SALT repeal would deliver 75 percent of its benefits to the richest 5 percent of his state — those making an average of $553,000 or more, according to <a href="https://t.co/bF60NMepqG?amp=1">data</a> from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. By contrast, Gottheimer’s SALT repeal initiative would provide almost no benefits to the bottom 80 percent of New Jersey households.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/04/the-salt-tax-deduction-is-a-handout-to-the-rich-it-should-be-eliminated-not-expanded/">Brookings Institution</a> reports that Gottheimer’s SALT repeal initiative is more regressive than Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts — and it would cost a whopping $600 billion, with half of that going to the tiny handful of households making <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/limit-deductible-state-and-local-taxes-salt-april-2021/t21-0058-repeal-10000-limit">more than $1 million a year</a>. Those benefits would be in addition to the existing mortgage-interest tax deduction, capital gains tax cuts, and Trump-era income tax cuts that all disproportionately benefit the wealthy.</p>

<p>According to Census data, last month, after Biden signed his COVID relief bill, the number of renters who said they were behind on rent dropped from 18.5 percent in late February to 14.7 percent <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp28.html">in April</a>. Now, however, that number is going back up, with 15 percent of renters saying they are behind on rent, according to Census <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp29.html">data</a> collected from April 28 to May 10.</p>
