<p>Dodge Power Dollars 2020 builds on Dodge’s strong muscle car sales  momentum in 2019. Last August, the brand set a goal of growing from 485  million horsepower to 500 million horsepower on the road by the end of  the year. It beat that goal two months early and extended the  industry-exclusive program until the end of the 2019 model year. The  results:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dodge had its best six-month sales in muscle car history in the last half of 2019</li>
    <li>“The Brotherhood of Muscle” grew in the second half of 2019 with record combined Charger and Challenger sales of 84,216 vehicles</li>
    <li>Dodge put 33 million more horsepower into the hands of performance enthusiasts across the country in the last half of 2019</li>
    <li>In 2019, Charger had its best sales year since 2013, with 96,935 units sold</li>
    <li>Challenger sales surpassed 60,000 units in 2019, more than double the sales when it was first introduced</li>
</ul>
<p>These Dodge brand enthusiasts are also lighting up the brand’s social  channels, where it now has 11 million fans across all channels,  surpassing more than 5 million on Instagram alone.
