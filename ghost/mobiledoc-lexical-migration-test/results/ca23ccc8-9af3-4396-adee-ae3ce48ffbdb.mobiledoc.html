<p>It's no secret that Ferrari, world-renowned for its ultra-luxurious and high-performance cars, can afford to be selective about its clientele. This exclusivity has led to the creation of a list of celebrities who, for various reasons, have been denied the privilege of owning a Ferrari straight from the factory.</p>

<p>One such example is the widely known and eccentric celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay. Despite owning an extensive Ferrari collection and being a self-professed fan of the brand, Ramsay was famously denied a chance to purchase the hyper-exclusive LaFerrari Aperta. Ferrari's decision was based on the fact that Ramsay, known for his fiery temperament, could potentially harm the brand's image.</p>
<p>Another high-profile personality who faced a similar situation is the Canadian pop sensation, Justin Bieber. His turbulent past and negative media attention led Ferrari to deny him the opportunity to own their cars. Bieberâ€™s reputation for reckless driving, including a high-profile incident involving a Lamborghini, is believed to have played a crucial role in Ferrari's decision.</p>

<p>The infamous "Deadmau5" Ferrari incident is another case worth mentioning. The renowned Canadian electronic music producer and DJ was given a cease and desist letter by Ferrari after he customized his 458 Italia, dubbed the 'Purrari,' with a Nyan Cat theme wrap. Ferrari viewed this as a defacement of their brand, leading to his ban.</p>
