Focusing on internet sales and non-traditional delivery methods, these chains enamored cynical consumers who were tired of the old dealership games. However, the revolution seems to be losing steam as problems for both companies accumulate. The question moving forward is will Carvana and Vroom be able to weather the storm, or is this curtains for the new kids on the block?"

After all, “the Amazon of car dealers” was surging despite critics waving it off as a short-lived fad. However, that meteoric rise suddenly sputtered and reversed course this year as news hit that Carvana was laying off 2,500 employees."

Morgan characterizing those Q1 results as “confidence shattering” since the company lost more per share than originally predicted. In the past 9 months, market value for Carvana has plummeted a whopping 92%. It seems the “growth-at-all-costs” strategy has sputtered."

That factor should be affecting more than just Carvana, signaling potential trouble across the industry. The difference between other dealers and Carvana is Carvana struggled to manage its excess inventory gracefully, thanks in part to what some former employees claim is explosive growth contributing to logistics problems. Ultimately, during Q1 of this year Carvana lost $3,255 for every vehicle sold."

He of course brought up the covid pandemic, something which initially worked in favor of the company as people wanted to buy cars but didn’t want to interact with others face-to-face. Buying a used vehicle from a giant vending machine or having it delivered at their house was soothing for many, but that charm seems to have worn thin."

Carvana reportedly will have to correct these problems before the suspension will be lifted."

According to the court filing, in some cases consumers waited over two years for their vehicle to be registered. That resulted in trouble with local police, sometimes leading to drivers being arrested. Carvana says the allegations have zero merit and claims no liability."
