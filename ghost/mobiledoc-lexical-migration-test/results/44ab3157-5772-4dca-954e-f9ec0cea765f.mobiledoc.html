<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1996-ford-mustang-svt-mystic-cobra/">My life is cars</a>, and it's been that way for as long as I can remember. I mean that quite literally. My first memory is of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/peoples-choice-leaders/">a car show</a>, and I learned how to read by identifying cars in parking lots and looking at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/top-down-1994-mercury-capri-xr2/">the badges on the trunklid</a>. </p>

<p>From that point on, I read car magazines with a voracious appetite for information about the newest and fastest machinery around, as well as the classics. Growing up, it seemed like there was a new "fastest car in the world" every few months. It was <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/211407/1995-ferrari-348-spider">an exciting time</a>.</p>

<p>In those days, all that mattered to me and my friends was <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/210587/1998-lotus-esprit-v8-se">how a car looked</a> and how fast it was. We didn't give a single thought to build quality, reliability, or warranties. You can forget about practicality, value, and fuel economy, too. </p>

<p>That boring stuff was for total dorks and/or grown ups. We were all going to grow up and be computer hacker astronaut rock stars who moonlight as cops/cowboys/cowboy cops, and we'd pull up to the red carpet in a purple Vector/teal ZR-1/<a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/207503/1997-porsche-911-turbo-s">yellow 993 Turbo S</a> with Pam Anderson/Courtney Cox/Alicia Silverstone in the passenger seat to accept our Grammy for Best Metal Album in the Universe, Forever.</p>

<p>We'd collect Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars of our <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/212656/1995-ford-mustang-cobra-r-svt">dream machines</a> and push them across the blacktop during recess. We'd disappoint our parents at the Scholastic Book Fair by blowing the $10 they gave us on that year's Porsche or Lamborghini poster instead of the Gary Paulsen book we were supposed to buy. We'd disappoint ourselves when we tried to assemble a model kit of our favorite car and wind up with a thumbprint right in the middle of the windshield.</p>

<p>Many a lunchroom battle was fought over published 0-60 times, skidpad numbers, and horsepower figures. As we got older and we got our hands on racing games like Need For Speed, Test Drive, and <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/210559/1990-nissan-300zx">Gran Turismo</a>, these discussions only grew more spirited. </p>
<p>Our inside voices would crescendo into full-blown shouting matches, with lots of finger-pointing at nothing in particular. Lunch aides would mobilize, ready to intervene should a fight break out. Eventually they realized that we actually liked each other â€“ we just liked our brand better. Ford vs. Chevy. Porsche vs. Ferrari. Jaguar vs. Lotus. The only car everyone agreed on was <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/212622/1995-dodge-viper">the Viper</a>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, though, we didn't care about being too cool for the room. Living in the Internet age, we seem to have a tendency to try to outdo each other on forums, in Facebook groups, and in comments sections with our knowledge of obscure cars. In doing so, we've become a lot like the boring grown-ups we used to sneer at as kids.</p>
<p>We are now a culture of Manic Pixie Car Enthusiasts. We're not like the <em>other</em> car enthusiasts, we <em>only </em>like weird things! We won't even bat an eye at seeing a new Ferrari in traffic (that simply doesn't <em>satisfy </em>our <em>cultured</em> palate anymore), but would you just <em>look</em> at that Olds Achieva parked on the street! Why, that might even be an ultra-rare, high-performance Achieva SCX! See, we don't <em>like</em> conventionally cool or popular things, like everyone else! Liking different things than most people is our personality! <em>We're so zany!</em></p>

<p>I'm not immune. My current obsession is my 1987 Merkur XR4Ti, Ford's attempt to woo BMW and Saab-buying yuppies in the late 1980s. The goal was to get them into Lincoln/Mercury dealerships with the European Ford Sierra, rebranded with a difficult-to-pronounce name. Unsurprisingly, it didn't work. It's an interesting historical footnote, and I get off on owning the only one in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>I bought it because it's got the same 2.3 liter turbo four-cylinder as a Mustang SVO or Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, but with a far better chassis, and because I have a thing for unusual 1980s and 1990s Fords.</p>
<p>Parked right next to it in the garage is a yellow 1986 Corvette. I bought it because it's yellow, and because it's a Corvette.</p>
