<hr>
<p>Even among <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-fox-body-mustang/">classic American muscle cars</a>, the Chevrolet <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/craigslist-find-1972-chevelle/">Chevelle</a> holds a special place in our hearts. That’s true for a lot of enthusiasts, which helps explain why certain models can be worth a bundle of cash these days. With people fantasizing about the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cuda-making-a-comeback/">Plymouth ‘Cuda</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/iroc-z-rendering/">other muscle car nameplates</a> making a comeback, it’s only natural artists are imagining what a modern <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/two-owner-chevelle-454-ss/">Chevelle</a> would look like.</p>
<p>This rendering we’re featuring was posted to Instagram <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-buick-grand-national/">by wb.artist20</a>, a digital artist who does quite a few what-if mockups of classic and modern cars. He decided to use the 1969 model as the basis for a new version of the Chevelle because “it’s the toughest.” We’re not sure if he means it’s the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wide-body-delorean/">toughest-looking</a> or the toughest to turn into a modern design, but sure.</p>
<p>Probably the first thing you’ll notice are the LED halo headlights flanking the retro-styled upper grille. We don’t like it, since it’s a little too BMW-like instead of having a connection with the modern Camaro or Corvette.</p>
<p>Just like on most of these classic cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-plymouth-cuda-rendered/">rendered as modern versions</a>, this Chevelle wears big wheels and tires tucked up under the fenders, something most people seem to hate seeing. While we get that’s the style these days, the squared-off fenders are a big turnoff for us.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising parts of this rendering is the roof. While it doesn’t look like it’s vinyl like on the ’69 Chevelle, it’s been painted to be similar in appearance. That’s not something you see these days, so it’s an interesting move we actually like.</p>
<p>By the way, wb.artist20 included a disclaimer on his post that he’s not even insinuating his rendering of the ’69 Chevelle in modern form is better-looking or better in any way than the original. We’re thinking he’s been getting some hate for other classic muscle car renderings.</p>
<p>What do you think of this rendering overall? Do you love it, think it’s ok, or hate it?</p>
