While it’s great for getting up to freeway speeds, obviously the main draw is the increased torque for pulling through tough off-road conditions. Plus, starting in 1998 Toyota used an electronic ignition system some greatly prefer, but as with everything others aren’t a fan. Still, enough people see value in this engine to make the FZJ80 a hot acquisition these days."
