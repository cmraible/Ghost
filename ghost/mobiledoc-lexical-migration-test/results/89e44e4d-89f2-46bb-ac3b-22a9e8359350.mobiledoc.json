          "Besides being one of the most potent cars on the racetrack, one of the coolest things about the 2019 ZR1 is just how unique it is. As a model, nothing else on the road comes even close to looking like it. Even the Stingray only vaguely resembles it and that's only in looks. Performance wise, the ZL1 may just be the fastest production car on the street. Unfortunately for the dreamers out there, its uniqueness is what also makes the ZR1 extremely hard to get your hands on. On an individual car basis, General Motors offered almost limitless options and packages, allowing buyers to tailor the ZR1 to their liking. All things considered, if you are looking at one of these fantastic cars chances are you might just be looking at one of the only ZR1s like it."

The Ermine White Camaro SS/RS convertible wearing contrasting Blue graphics with a Bright Blue interior was an instant hit which helped solidify an epic place in history for the Camaro. Of the 285,748 Camaro’s produced in 1967 only 104 of them were Official Pace Car models, so getting your hand on one has never been an easy task."
