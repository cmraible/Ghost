<p>At a press conference on June 18, 1971, Pres. Richard Nixon announced the launch of the War on Drugs, a global campaign to combat the illicit narcotics trade. But after spending more than a trillion dollars on the effort and locking up one of its citizens for drug possession every 25 seconds, the United States is still no closer to ending the scourge of drug abuse.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: This week, on the 50th anniversary of Nixon’s announcement, lawmakers introduced legislation that offers a radical new approach to solving the drug crisis.</p>

Bonnie] Watson Coleman, who is also the sponsor of a congressional resolution to condemn the drug war, said… “As we work to solve this issue, it is essential that we change tactics in how we address drug use away from the failed punitive approach and towards a health-based and evidence-based approach.”</p>

But the vote does little to reduce the actual authority amassed by the White House over the past 20 years to use force all around the world.”</p>

The draft financial assurance regulations, released by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, cover all 50,000 oil and gas wells in the state and in general require a full-cost of plugging financial guarantee of $78,000 for each of a company’s wells.”</p>

John Carney</strong></a></strong>(Delaware Online) — Both houses of the Delaware state legislature have now passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, and Gov. John Carney is expected to sign it into law. When he does, Delaware will be the tenth state to have a $15 minimum wage. Not only is it a win for workers, but it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/delaware-just-humiliated-its-democratic/">also undermines</a> the arguments made by the state’s federal senators who previously helped Republicans kill an effort to include a $15 minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan.</p>
