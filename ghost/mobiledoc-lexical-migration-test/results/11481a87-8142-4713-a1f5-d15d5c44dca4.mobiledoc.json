Since this is an RT Turbo model, it pairs the 3.0-liter DOHC V6 with twin turbos, making it quick and fun to drive."

It helps you hug the road through turns and of course comes in handy if the weather takes a turn for the worse. Four-wheel steering just adds to the nimble nature of this Dodge. Plus, there’s a 5-speed manual transmission, so you’re rowing through the gears like it should be on any proper performance vehicle."
