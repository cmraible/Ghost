<p>Despite what we’re seeing in the headlines, good things are happening! First off, a major insurance company says it will no longer insure coal, tar sands, and Arctic exploration projects. Then, the Biden administration’s lease sale of 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico may not happen after all! That’s not the only bit of positive climate news: EU member states may soon tax energy companies seeing windfall profits with the recent surge in gas prices. Workers also continue to gain ground with unionization efforts, including a major victory by <em>New York Times</em> tech workers. And progressives continue to make headway in their efforts to take over the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has opted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/02/28/biden-administration-wont-appeal-judges-ruling-revoking-gulf-mexico-drilling-leases/?utm_campaign=Daily%20Briefing&utm_content=20220301&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">not to appeal</a> a federal court’s ruling that invalidated its lease sale of 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The administration had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/does-not-present-sufficient-cause/">come under fire</a> from environmental groups for holding the lease sale in the first place. In its record of decision for the lease sale, the administration dismissed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">Sixth Assessment Report</a> on the grounds that it did not present “sufficient cause” to cancel the sale. In invalidating the lease sale, the federal court held that climate change had not adequately been considered.</p>
<p>The news isn’t all good. In its filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, the administration suggested that it would hold the sales if the lower court ruling was overturned, and the American Petroleum Institute, the largest fossil fuel industry trade group, is already challenging the decision. But, we’ll take our win for now.</p>
<p>Also, Portland Public Schools, the largest school district in Oregon, has <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2022/03/03/pps-climate-policy.html">rejected</a> a push by utility NW Natural to start buying “renewable natural gas.” The energy company’s proposal would have moved the school district away from its climate goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2040.</p>
<p>Still more good climate news: Insurer AIG has <a href="https://twitter.com/hannahsaggau/status/1498711165249081347?s=20&t=J3OpaF_zRul-oEMOnT6dGA">committed</a> to ending insurance for new tar sands, coal, and Arctic exploration projects. The move promises to make the cost of doing business higher for fossil fuel companies.</p>
<p>Outside the U.S., the European Commission reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-tax-energy-firms-windfall-profits-raise-green-cash-eu-tell-countries-2022-02-28/">plans to recommend</a> that the 27 E.U. member states tax energy companies’ windfall profits to fund renewable energy or energy-saving measures. Gas prices have spiked recently in response to fears of disruption due to Russia, Europe’s top natural gas supplier, invading Ukraine and stoking confrontation with NATO. The tax proposal is expected next week.</p>

<h3 id="workers-win-landslide-union-victories-despite-management%E2%80%99s-best-efforts">Workers Win Landslide Union Victories Despite Management’s Best Efforts</h3>
<p>Multiple New York City workplaces this week voted to unionize, despite herculean union-busting efforts by management.</p>
<p>The tech workers of the<em> New York Times</em><a href="https://twitter.com/NYTGuildTech/status/1499511515476631554">won their union election</a> by a sweeping 404-88 vote, making them the largest bargaining unit of tech workers in the country. The <em>Times</em> had attempted to block the union election from taking place, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) rejected their effort. The NLRB also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/01/leaked-messages-new-york-times-anti-union-strategy">filed a complaint</a> against the paper for illegal union-busting tactics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers at the outdoor store REI <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/rei-workers-in-soho-voted-to-form-companys-first-union-organizers-say">won their union election</a> 88 to 14. REI management <a href="https://our.rei.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/REI_Transcript_v02_220203.pdf">produced an entire podcast</a> explaining why a union wasn’t necessary, featuring the company's CEO in an attempt to persuade workers not to unionize.</p>
<p>And officials in 17 states and Washington D.C. are <a href="https://twitter.com/TerriGerstein/status/1496853554333732865?s=20&t=G8qwE9aOwlt0ASBSNyQfyw">calling upon Starbucks</a> to stop their union-busting tactics against the wave of barista organizing sweeping the country.</p>
<p>Are you thinking of busting a union? Labor reporter Hamilton Nolan has a good tip:</p>

<h3 id="good-news-for-progressives">Good News for Progressives</h3>
<p>Democratic socialist Greg Casar just handily won an open congressional primary in Texas’ 35th congressional district, which is overwhelmingly Democratic. Casar, who supports Medicare for all and the Green New Deal, will be <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/01/greg-casar-democratic-primary-austin/">one of the most progressive</a> congresspeople Texas has ever had. He is known for his support for slashing police budgets and advocacy for the homeless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 28-year-old human rights attorney Jessica Cisneros has forced embattled Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), into a runoff. Cisneros came within 2,700 votes of defeating Cuellar in a 2020 primary. Since then, the anti-abortion incumbent has faced scandal, with the FBI raiding his home and campaign office back in January as part of an investigation into a group of U.S. businessmen with ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>Once again, the number of jobs added to the economy in February <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">far outpaced</a> economists’ estimates. The labor market recovery <a href="https://twitter.com/IrvingSwisher/status/1499749713129750529?s=20&t=G8qwE9aOwlt0ASBSNyQfyw">has been faster</a> than in the wake of the Great Recession and other recent economic downturns, thanks to the federal government’s temporary turn away from decades of austerity politics. Low unemployment has created a <a href="https://twitter.com/IrvingSwisher/status/1499749713129750529?s=20&t=G8qwE9aOwlt0ASBSNyQfyw">tight labor market,</a> driving up wages and giving workers more bargaining power to demand improved working conditions or leave their jobs for better ones.</p>
<h3 id="new-dino-discovered">New Dino Discovered :)</h3>
<p>A new species of stegosaur known as <em>Bashanosaurus primitivus </em>has been <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/march/new-stegosaur-dinosaur-species-could-be-oldest-ever-discovered.html">identified</a> from fossils uncovered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/world/stegosaur-fossil-discovery-scn/index.html">in 2016 in China</a>. The specimen, which dates back to the Middle Jurassic period, could be the oldest ever found, suggesting that all stegosauruses originated in Asia more than 165 million years ago. The new discovery comes on the heels of a groundbreaking discovery that there are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/03/03/tyrannosaurus-rex-more-species-study/6983204001/">three separate species</a> of tyrannosaur, and several days after it was reported that a <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/armless-but-not-harmless-bizarre-new-dinosaur-species-discovered-in-argentina/">new armless carnivorous dinosaur</a> from the Late Cretaceous period was discovered in Argentina.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty cool time for paleontology!</p>
