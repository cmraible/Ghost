In the front of the barn you can clearly see Chevy two nova with four doors awaiting his chance to get back up and running again.

Both of these are pretty cool cars made for drivers who liked a little bit of style and comfort mixed in with their sports cars. Finally, the cream of the crop has to be the 1968 Chevrolet Caprice. Another four-door, this car is the perfect meeting point of iconic late 60s styling and practicality for its time.",
