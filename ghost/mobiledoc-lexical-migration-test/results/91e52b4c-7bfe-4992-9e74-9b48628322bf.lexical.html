<p>To create the Maybach S650 Cabriolet, Mercedes started with the AMG S65 as a jumping point with its 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 laying down 612 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. From there, the high-lux convertible received exclusive styling cues with the most notable being those massive 20-inch forged wheels, a unique front bumper and Maybach badging; this car was only offered in three colors (Zircon Red, Cote d'Azur Blue and Diamond White) with this particular car obviously being the latter paired with a blue top.</p>
<p>The interior also gets a generous upgrade replacing the S-Class' already-amazing interior with a more exclusive look and feel fitting of a Maybach-badged vehicle. The seats get a really cool waterfall upholstery design with quilted pattern inserts and embossed Mayabch logos throughout the interior, and the added exclusivity also includes projected Maybach logo puddle lights and special "1 of 300" lettering displayed on the center console. In addition to the exclusive elements, the Maybach S650 Cabriolet comes loaded with every option that the standard S-Class coupe offers including Swarovski headlamps.</p>
<p>As an extra special touch, the Maybach S650 Cabriolet comes with embossed set of luggage, a car cover that matches the convertible top and a signed certificate from Dr Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars. If you want to one of the rarest and coolest car to come from Mercedes in recent years, then be sure to check out this drop-top Maybach.</p>
