This car was the perfect choice for the film as it is a far lesser-known model than its Mustang or Mercury brethren. Nowadays, we have an even more excellent Gran Torino rolling around the streets of California with a massive V8 motor under the hood. The reasoning behind comparing the two cars is that this customized Ford beast was a tribute to the current owner’s grandmother. She was the original owner of this vehicle.",

Along with the beautiful sound, the motor also puts out 560 horsepower and 540 ft/lbs of torque, making hooking and acceleration a violent experience of raw brutality.
