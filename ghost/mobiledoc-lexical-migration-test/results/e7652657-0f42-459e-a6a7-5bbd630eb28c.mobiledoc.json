However, they can miss some big things, like the fact C8 Corvette owners claim using an aftermarket radar detector has crackled their driver’s side mirrors."

As you can see from the photo posted on GM Techlink, the driver’s side mirror looks like has a crazy maze of lines all over it. The mirror also has a dim reflection, so it’s really not very useful."

While disconnecting the jumper harness prevents the problem from repeating, the damaged side mirror has to be replaced. Unfortunately, this isn’t covered by the factory warranty. In other words, if this happened to you, it’s time to have a conversation with the idiot who used the jumper harness to install the radar detector. That conversation might include the use of another mirror."
