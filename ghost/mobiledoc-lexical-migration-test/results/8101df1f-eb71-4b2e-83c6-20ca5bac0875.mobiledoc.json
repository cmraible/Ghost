Although, as seen in a video from a few years ago involving a Hellcat and in this one that involves an early , it never really works out for the get-a-way drivers as the common theme here is the face in the dirt ending. Looking on the bright side of other peopleâ€™s poor life choices though, we spectators are usually left with a very entertaining video to watch."

Likewise, it is also unknown who was driving the purple Mustang but his or her driving skills are noteworthy. After about 40 minutes the Oklahoma City Police see their opportunity to end the dangerous pursuit and proceed with a pit maneuver."

The officers then try the tactic two more times until finally putting the Mustang into the wall. Just when you think the chase is through, the Mustang continues in reverse until another cop rams the car and pushes it into a stop sign."
