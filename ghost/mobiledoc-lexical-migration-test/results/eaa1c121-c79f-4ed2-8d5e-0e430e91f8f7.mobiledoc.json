          " is easily one of the most popular muscle cars from the era of high-performance muscle powered by big-block V8s. Although unknown at the time, the 1970 model year was edging closer to the demise of the movement with the oil crisis looming on the horizon that would cause people to buy smaller cars for fuel efficiency. Here we have a beautiful example of a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396."

          "As mentioned above, powering this vintage Chevelle is the highly desirable 396 cui V8 engine that still retains the original specifications. Sending power to the rear wheels is a numbers-matching M21 four-speed transmission that feeds to an original rear end. A functional cowl induction hood protects the engine bay but feeds cool air into the engine for utmost performance. In fact, not many Chevelles were produced with the potent motor that generates a healthy power.  It comes with the Canadian build sheet and is still retains all original paperwork and is on the original 1 owner title."
