Hopefully, that projection doesn’t get pushed back again, but it’s possible since it seems like whenever we get an update the timeline is pushed further back."

It’s a silly pursuit since cars stay on the road for well over a decade, making technology which is cutting-edge when it’s first developed incredibly dated in short order. A better solution would be to project a person’s smartphone onto the touchscreen, kind of like what Apple CarPlay and Android Auto do, only better. Most people put their phone in a holder and use it for navigation, music, etc. because it has cutting-edge tech, the apps they’re familiar with, and it works far better than some aging infotainment system."
