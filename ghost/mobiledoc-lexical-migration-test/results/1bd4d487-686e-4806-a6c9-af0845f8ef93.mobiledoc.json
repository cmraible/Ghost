He also had a TV show called Kevin Hart’s Muscle Car Crew, just in case you didn’t get it clear that he likes cars.

After all, popping the hood reveals a decidedly modern new-gen 6.2-liter LT1 V8 with 460-horsepower on tap. While that might not be as powerful as you might hope, it’s plenty to get the little sports car going in a hurry. Paired up with that mill is a 4-speed 4L74e automatic transmission. We would’ve gone with a stick, but it’s not our ride."
