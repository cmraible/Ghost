While there are a fair amount of long beards and black leather, some motorcycle riders are clad in softer colors like pink, showing that not everyone was rough around the edges. In fact, one of the clubs interviewed revealed only married couples were allowed to join. And yes, Harleys absolutely dominated the scene. What were you expecting, BMWs?"

It’s all part of the flavor of this video, so enjoy the charm."

That’s when the city and local chamber of commerce worked to help change the nature of the gathering. Things have changed considerably since then, with Bike Week lasting 10 days and hundreds of events being held all over Volusia County."
