<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at Loftur Studio’s <em>Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD</em>. The game is slated to release in December 2019. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p><strong>Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD</strong> is a not-so-serious adventure that brings together mechanics from Action RPG and RTS games. You’ll control <strong>Kofi</strong>, a weak, lazy and unlucky videogame character that will be followed by a group of interesting (and pathetic) characters aiding him to live a great adventure.<br>The videogame introduces a world of comic fantasy in which the characters are aware of being part of a videogame. Kofi is an RPG character that spends his days lazing around without leveling up. His game is a total mess and every character around him plays better.</p>
