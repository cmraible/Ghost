<p>To the untrained eye, this is just another red <a href="https://centralclassiccars.com/vehicles/69/1970-porsche-911e-euro-spec?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Porsche 911 E</a>. However, to those with a smattering of Porsche knowledge, the specimen offered up by <a href="https://centralclassiccars.com/vehicles/69/1970-porsche-911e-euro-spec?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Central Classic Cars</a> is somewhat special – in more ways than one.</p>

In production for only two years, this powerplant seems to drive collectors crazy. Enthusiasts regard the shortlived engine as the greatest air-cooled motor from any factory produced 911. Strong stuff.</p>

<p>Furthering the 2.2-liters alluring narrative, rumor states that the engine is the last one directly connected to Porsche’s racing program. As far as enthusiast cars go, Porsche specialists rarely hold any other variant in such high regard – some even say that these were the last ‘pure 911s’, due to incoming government restrictions and cost limitations that affected subsequent models.</p>
<p>So, not only is this particular model über-rare, but<a href="https://centralclassiccars.com/vehicles/69/1970-porsche-911e-euro-spec?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious"> Central Classic Cars</a>’ 1970 example has an ace card to play. It’s a legitimate garage find with only 29,843kms on the clock, having been under the wing of the same family since the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Sporting a 5-speed manual and black leatherette interior, the only major change throughout this Porsche’s life to date has been a colour change. Originally Pastel Blue, the bodywork now wears a thick coating of dark red with Carrera decals. Don’t let this put you off though, as the paint job has been undertaken to the highest degree. <br><br>The chassis appears straight and dry, with the door bottoms and seams all free from rust. The seat covers are thought to be original, while the felt floor carpets are also original to the car and in very good condition.</p>
