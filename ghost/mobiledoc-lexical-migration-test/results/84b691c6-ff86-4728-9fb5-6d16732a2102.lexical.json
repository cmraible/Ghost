Oftentimes you’re bugging your kids to get their homework done, clean their rooms, wash the dishes, stop eating dirt, say please and thank you, stop reaching over others at the table, and other things they don’t want to hear. However, children grow up and hopefully mature enough to realize all that you’ve done for them, if you’re indeed a good parent (and we hope you are). That’s when they express appreciation for what you’ve done, which is exactly what these two sons did for their dad when they bought a nice 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle for him.",

In other words, with guys like these in the world there is most definitely hope for the younger generation.",
