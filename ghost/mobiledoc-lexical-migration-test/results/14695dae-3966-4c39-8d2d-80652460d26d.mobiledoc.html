<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1996-ford-mustang-svt-mystic-cobra/">Special edition Mustangs</a> have existed since the model's earliest days. Back in the late 1960s, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-restored-cars-on-motorious/">Ford experimented</a> with regional <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/retro-review-trans-ams/">special editions</a>. Coloradans got the Ski Country Special in 1967, while folks residing in Tornado Alley got the Twister Special in 1970.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best known regional Mustang is the 1968 California Special (GT/CS). Ford had recently acquired Shelby Automotive, and leaned on them to develop the unique look of the GT/CS.</p>
<p>The most noticeable aspect of the California Special is the use of Shelby-style taillights taken from the 1965 Thunderbird. While Shelby Mustangs of this era were all fastbacks, all GT/CS Mustangs were coupes.</p>

<p>Other GT/CS features included side scoops, a decklid spoiler, hood pins, fog lights, a pop-open gas cap, and unique striping. These features gave the California Special Mustangs a "factory custom" look, similar to the modified cars that were running around Southern California at the time.</p>
<p>Just over 4,000 California Specials were built in 1968. <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/176184/1968-ford-mustang-gt-cs-california-special">This Acapulco Blue example</a> has been recently restored, and shows just 32,000 miles on the odometer. Most California Specials were 289 V8/C4 automatic cars, and this one is no exception.</p>

<p>This one would make a comfortable cruiser. It has air conditioning, power disc brakes and power steering. If you live in one of the other 49 states, California dreamin' doesn't get much better than this.</p>
