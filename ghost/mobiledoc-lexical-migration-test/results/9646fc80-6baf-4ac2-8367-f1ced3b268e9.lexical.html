<hr>
<p>Full disclosure: we’re not super into donks, so when we saw a YouTube channel pitted a 1972 Chevy Caprice <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/beautiful-1970-chevelle-restomod-donk/">donk</a> against a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lamborghini-aventadors-race/">Lamborghini Aventador SV</a> we just assumed it was a joke. Then we watched the video and couldn’t believe our eyes. Yes, donks can be fast, believe it or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check out the donk driven by an NFL star <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/darius-slay-donk/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>It’s obvious from the get-go the race isn’t super serious but instead is all about just having a good time and seeing how these two very different vehicles stack up against each other. We’ve featured other crazy mismatches before, which can be entertaining to watch and sometimes are closer than you would think at first blush.</p>

<p>Apparently, under the hood of the donk is a 5.3-liter V8 with a 76 mm turbo bolted up. Supposedly, the setup doesn’t involve internal swaps in the engine and is good for somewhere around 650- to 800-horsepower. In other words, it’s probably making more like 1,000-hp and has all kinds of extra goodies shoved in there.</p>
<p>Of course, when your wheels are really big you actually stand a lesser chance in a race. If that weren’t true, we’d see all kinds of drag racers with donk-like wheels and skinny, low-profile tires just demolishing everyone at the track. Since this race is a rolling start, the donk has a little less of a disadvantage, otherwise that Aventador SV with its rather advanced all-wheel-drive system would just smoke it off the line.</p>
<p>Instead, with a rolling start, these two are more closely matched than most would assume. Sure, they’re not on a prepped surface and we don’t think either one is running slicks, but they both pull strong and put up a good fight. However, only one can win, so check out the video to see which it is.</p>
