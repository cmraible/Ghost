There were some announcements that you&#8217;d expect, but there were also some that took us by complete surprise. So let&#8217;s get right into it&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Just Dance 2019</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Just Dance 2019 E3 2018 Ubisoft Stage Performance\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOSlWkCw7KI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Ubisoft kicked off their press conference with a performance for Just Dance 2019. Not much to say about this one (other than it releases in October on Switch, Wii U AND Wii) as it is just the next Just Dance, but there was a cool dancing panda.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trials Rising</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Trials Rising: E3 2018 Announcement Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sN1va4g8msU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Ubisoft revealed a brand new trailer for Trials Rising, showing off some extreme, death-defying motorbike stunts. The game was announced to come to the Nintendo Switch, a first for the series, in February 2019.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mario + Rabbids Donkey Kong Adventure</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle: E3 2018 Donkey Kong Adventure DLC Gameplay Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/69YOF_kcUw0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Grant Kirkhope and the orchestra took to the stage to show off the music for the new DLC coming very soon on June 26 (or June 25th for Season Pass owners). It. Was. AMAZING! We received a tonne of footage, including some gameplay footage that showed off some of Donkey Kong&#8217;s signature moves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Starlink: Battle for Atlas</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Starlink: Battle for Atlas: E3 2018 Star Fox Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3ZffcWXx_I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It took a full year, but we finally got some more information on the space adventure game that was revealed at E3 2018. With a tonne of gameplay footage, we also received some shocking news that Fox McCloud and his crew will be in the game exclusively on Nintendo Switch. Shigeru Miyamoto was once again present at the Ubisoft press conference. We also received a release date for Starlink: Battle for Atlantis: October 16, 2018.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we later learned that a special edition starter pack of the Switch version of Starlink: Battle for Atlas is now available for pre-order. Check it out&#8230;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1940\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1940\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1940\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Starlink-Starter-Pack.jpg?resize=656%2C370\" alt=\"Ubisoft Starlink Starter Pack\" width=\"656\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Starlink-Starter-Pack.jpg?w=656&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Starlink-Starter-Pack.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1940\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit Ubisoft</p></div></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what do you think?
