While electrification might eventually become a true force in the market, for now it’s more of a novelty or plaything for those who can afford it in every sense of the word. A key example comes via Ford’s Mach-E, the so-called Mustang crossover. That EV has made the Blue Oval exactly zero in profits, despite many in the media praising it almost nonstop.",
