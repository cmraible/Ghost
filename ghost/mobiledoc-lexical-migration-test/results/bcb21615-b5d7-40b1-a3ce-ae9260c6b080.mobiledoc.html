<h3 id="remember-when-suvs-used-to-be-exciting">Remember when SUVs used to be exciting?</h3>
<p>If you were ever hoping for a rebirth of SUVs like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Blazer" rel="nofollow">K5 Blazer</a>, you can keep dreaming. And that's just what we did since GM hasn't built a two-door, full-size in over 20 years.</p>
<p>Aside from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/retro-k5-blazer-2018-sema/" rel="nofollow">custom, one-off creations</a>, it's not very likely that such a body design will ever make a comeback in production form, so we used our imagination to digitally render modern versions of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet" rel="nofollow">Chevy</a>'s iconic two-door SUV based on the all-new 2021 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Tahoe" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> that will be coming out later this year. We created two renderings based on this idea for a two-door, shortened-wheelbase SUV: an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/highlights/">off-road</a>-friendly ZR2 configuration and a more sinister SS version.</p>

<p>For off-road enthusiasts, we created the two-door Chevy Tahoe ZR2 using the 2021 Tahoe Z71 as a starting point. Like the Colorado ZR2, this is a more extreme off-road version of the production Tahoe, and we added old-school elements like a steel bumper and swing-out doors with a separate hinged glass (similar to the Ford Excursion). The big, black fender extensions are a throwback to the original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/S-10?filter=eyJtb2RlbHMiOlsiUzEwIl19" rel="nofollow">S-10</a> ZR2, which was needed to accommodate that truck's wider track.</p>

<p>With more of a street performance look in mind, the two-door Chevy Tahoe SS would be geared toward sportier family haulers like the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk and Mercedes-AMG's various high-powered SUVs. This Tahoe SS features a lowered stance with a monochromatic paint scheme, and we also tweaked the front fascia to give it a more menacing appearance with a larger lower grille opening and taller, wider vertical air intakes.</p>
