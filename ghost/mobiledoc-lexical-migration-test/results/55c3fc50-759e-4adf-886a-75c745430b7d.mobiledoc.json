These vans showed the world that the age-old tradition of nomadic travel could still be accomplished in the modern world. Essentially the vehicles allowed more people to enjoy the hippie lifestyle and follow their dreams across the globe. This particular vehicle is from the early 1970s, which was a time primarily known for its financial downfall and high gas prices. These hardships lead to even more emphasis on independence and defiance within the hippie culture. That's why vans like this are so incredibly iconic and why you should consider this one for your next automotive purchase."

As far as exterior quality goes, this bus must be one of the best of its kind as there are no visible scratches or dents on the body. This combines with the undercarriage, which shows minimal rust and dirt to make a vehicle that will be good for years to come. All of this is well and good, but the exterior quality is not usually the central selling point for these cars. Rather than the title goes to the interior, which is typically spacious and comfortable enough for multiple people."

Comfort and even luxury seem to have been the focus when designing this bus as a luscious seating arrangement coats the rear and side of the cabin. This vehicle was made for long road trips and camping as it also has a couple of hefty speakers on the bottom of the rear seats. This lets you crank up the tunes and drive wherever you like, with your pals blasting Jimi Hendrix."
