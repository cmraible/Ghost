However, after seeing a new Porsche 911 cubed supposedly to create a masterpiece you’ll have a better appreciation for the ridiculous garbage which passes for aesthetic beauty in some circles."

That seems like so little effort compared to Michelangelo sculpting David for 2 years, but as we’re sure the art crowd will be quick to point out, we’re just some gearheads who “obviously” know nothing about aesthetic beauty and creating something from scratch (insert plenty of sarcasm here)."

In the foreground of the shot is a glass vase which looks like it might have been hand blown. It’s a thing of beauty, in part because the artist took raw materials and made something interesting and useful out of it."
