New York, Jerusalem, Moscow and Tokyo are the areas you will complete a series of linear missions in, with each marked with an objective marker which you will follow to each new point of interest. Objectives involve flicking switches, activating gates and fighting undead but the real fun begins when you stumble into a swarm arena. It takes place like a battle like no other; the game will pit you against hundreds of running, screaming zombies that flood the area, all hungry and out for blood. It's here where I was really blown away by the sheer amount of on-screen zombie models with each climbing up and jumping from the tops of buildings to get to you - it was heart pounding! The sense of dread as they approach your position is heart wrenching!"

As they climb up walls in huge hordes and throw themselves off ledges, it certainly gets the adrenaline pumping. Thankfully in these arena based areas, you'll have a refill box at your disposal when you're low on ammo. You can carry one main, one side and one special weapon, with each  tied to your class which is selected in the loadout menu and can be upgraded throughout your play time. There are seven classes in total with each having their own unlockable perks. You will always have the same weapons when you start each mission but there are a number of pick-ups while playing. Plus, each weapon can be levelled up by purchasing new upgraded versions. There are 25 weapons available each to unlock with multiple different variations split into a tier system."
