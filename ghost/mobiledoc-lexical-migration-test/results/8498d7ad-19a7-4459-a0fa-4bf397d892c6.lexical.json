Aside from the ZR-1 badges, the easiest visual cues to spot a ZR-1 are the rear lights. Earlier models introduced the rounded rear end with taillights that were more squared off, but even when the standard Corvette upgraded to this style, the ZR-1's third brake light remained on the roof rather than incorporated into the body.",
