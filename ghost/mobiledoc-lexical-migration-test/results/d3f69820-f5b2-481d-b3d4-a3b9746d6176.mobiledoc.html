<div>I wrote an essay for the good people of Theme Park on[ the tyranny of paper and wires on office work](http://www.inthethemepark.com/blog/finding-new-windows-stare-through?hash=/blog/all/0#.UCkwQqnbybw) – and our future liberation from them:</div>><div>Like so many tyrants, paper was overthrown – by the digital age. And, like so many revolutions, we just exchanged one tyranny for another. We took the wire as our new ruler, and it bound us tightly to our desk. The electric cables to power our computers; the ethernet jacks connecting us to the internet; even the twisted copper of the phone line all conspired to keep us on the office’s side of the window.</div>
