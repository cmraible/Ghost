<p>This week, <em>The Lever</em> broke a story that brought critical attention to failings of the <em>Washington Post</em>’s fact checking. Senior editor and reporter Andrew Perez fact checked the <em>Post</em>’s widely shared Fact Checker column questioning a news report about a 10-year-old child who was raped and had to travel from Ohio to Indiana for an abortion. This faulty <em>WaPo</em> article was weaponized by anti-abortion activists and right-wing pundits at a crucial moment, after the Supreme Court invalidated federal protections for abortion rights. So setting the record straight in this instance could not be more important. <strong>Andrew joins us on this week's <em>Lever Time</em> podcast to discuss his investigative reporting, which ultimately led to the <em>WaPo</em> issuing a correction. <em>This segment begins at 2:10.</em></strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/5f9cac17/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
