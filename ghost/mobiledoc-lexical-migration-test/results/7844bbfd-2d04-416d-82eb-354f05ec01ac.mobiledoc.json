Fortunately, most of them aren’t all that creative or intelligent, although some incredibly simplistic methods tend to work on the majority of the population. A perfect example of this comes to us via Ireland of all places where car theft is an issue, just like in many other countries like the United States and Canada."

For starters, having a tracker or multiple trackers in your car before handing the keys over to a stranger would be abundantly wise. Also, take a photo of the person’s driver’s license before you let them have the keys, just in case. After all, someone can fake a Facebook profile easier than a license."

While it allows you to keep track of what’s happening to your car, the person supposedly interested in buying it could transport you somewhere remote. As many security experts caution, never let a stranger drag you into a vehicle, because it might be the last time anyone sees you alive. If that sounds paranoid, it is, but more and more car thieves are becoming downright violent to steal from regular people."
