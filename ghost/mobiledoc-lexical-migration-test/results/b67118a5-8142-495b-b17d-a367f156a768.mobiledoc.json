          " is fast paced, fun and addictive. It’s pure arcade fighting bliss for the most part. The combos are sophisticated and therefore familiar for hardcore fighting game fans, while being simple enough for even the newest of noobs to pull off some impressive techniques. The battles themselves are mercifully short, which adds to the frantic action and helps the game from going stale too quickly (more on that in the “Bad” section, unfortunately). Each character has a full roster of combo moves that are very satisfying to pull off and are probably the visual highlight of this game. The combat in general is the zenith of this experience; it feels very solid at its core and will check all the boxes of the die-hard fighting game fan. The multiplayer modes and boss rush might help alleviate some of the repetitive nature of the fighting genre, and it'll be interesting to see how active the servers for a small game like this remain."

It’s a weird thing to note because without the fast pace of the gameplay, it would drag and ultimately be unremarkable, but its presence also serves to make the game less engaging in the long run.
