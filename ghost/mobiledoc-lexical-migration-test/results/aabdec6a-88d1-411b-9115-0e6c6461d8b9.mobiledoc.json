In the last 24 hours I’ve seen these:\n\nA [blog post from Robert Peston](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28130581) has been “forgotten”:\n\n> Now in my blog, only one individual is named. He is Stan O’Neal, the former boss of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.\n> \n> My column describes how O’Neal was forced out of Merrill after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made.\n> \n> Is the data in it “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant”?\n\n\n## The ref calls for silence\n\nA whole chunk of *Guardian*[stories have been effectively removed from Google’s index](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/02/eu-right-to-be-forgotten-guardian-google), for the purposes of direct searching:\n\n> The first six articles down the memory hole – there will likely be many more as the rich and powerful look to scrub up their online images, doubtless with the help of a new wave of “reputation management” firms – are a strange bunch.\n> \n> Three of the articles, dating from 2010, relate to a now-retired Scottish Premier League referee, Dougie McDonald, who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a Celtic v Dundee United match, the backlash to which prompted his resignation.\n\nThe stories are still live on *The Guardian* site – they just can’t be easily found through the obvious Google searches.\n\nAnyone seen any others yet?\n\n*Image by [Tim Samoff](https://www.flickr.com/photos/timsamoff/548769325/), and used under a Creative Commons licence*\n\n\n"
