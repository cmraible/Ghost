          "This Bel Air underwent an extensive restoration, and the overall quality is obvious by checking out the black paint job, the black-and-red interior and even the spot-free undercarriage. Adding to the vintage Tri-Five looks, this Bel Air is rocking wire wheels with white wall tires, electric cutouts with big, chrome side pipes and a continental tire kit. The Bel Air's extensive chrome and aluminum trim is a perfect complement to the deep, black paint, and the interior looks absolutely flawless."

This engine is paired to a column-mounted three-speed manual, and to ensure this car is as fun to cruise in as it is to show, it also has power steering, power brakes and air conditioning. For added reliability, this Chevy also has an aluminum radiator and an Optima RedTop battery."
