<p>When more than 200 of the world’s coolest collector cars take over the 18th fairway of the Crystal Springs Golf Course on July 21, the 64<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="http://www.hillsboroughconcours.org/">Hillsborough Concours d’Elegance</a> will get underway. This event is a showcase of the best in automotive engineering and design. Porsche will be the moniker honored at this year’s event, in recognition of the German brand’s contributions to sport car design.</p>
<p>“That prized racer will be among a handful of rare <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/porsches-to-buy-now/">Porsches</a> from the private collection of racer and restorer Bruce Canepa. Additional Canepa-owned Porsches on display will include a 917/10, 935, 962, 959SC and a 918 Spyder,” even organizers said in a press release.</p>
<p>“Given its history and impact on the Northern California collector car culture, we felt that the Hillsborough Concours is an ideal venue for us to show these specific cars,” said Bruce Canepa. “In honoring Porsche as its featured marque, the Concours truly hits at the passion we have for this acclaimed German brand.”</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hillsboroughconcours.org/">Hillsborough Concours d’Elegance</a> is the world’s longest continuously running Concours, and it brings together rare automobiles from virtually every automaker, niche, and era. At the venue will be muscle cars, hot rods, luxury cars, super cars, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Kicking off the event is the “Concours Kick-Off Party” at an exclusive car club on July 19th, the following Saturday morning, a police escort will accompany a 70-mile rally along the Bay Area with a luncheon following at a private estate in Hillsborough.</p>
<p>“Each year, our goal is to provide Concours patrons with an exceptional showcase of the world’s most stunning collector cars, from American muscle to exotics to elegant luxury cars to racers,” said Concours Chairman Richard Kelaita. “Thanks to an unprecedented number of submissions, this year’s display will be our best ever in terms of variety and excellence. No matter what an enthusiast’s passion may be, we’ll have something for everyone.”</p>
<p>"A total of 24 judged classes of rare sports and luxury cars will be on display at the Concours, all vying for the coveted “Best of Show” award, as chosen by a panel of esteemed experts from the international collector car world. While event organizers are still selecting from an abundance of entries, early confirmations include a 1934 Rolls-Royce Phantom II, a 1949 Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 Supersport, a 1953 Fiat 8V Supersonic, a 1971 American Motors AMX and the crazy 1961 “Beatnik Bandit” custom built by Ed “Big Daddy” Roth."</p>
