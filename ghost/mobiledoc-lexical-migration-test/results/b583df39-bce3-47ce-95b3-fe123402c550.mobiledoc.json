Not only did police target street racing, police also went after overly aggressive drivers."

Law enforcement has identified about 300 additional people who either participated in or watched illegal events. Instead of being arrested and having their car seized, those people will get a warning letter in the mail, which details out the charges they could face if they don’t stop breaking the law. While it would be great if everyone would listen and wise up, we know some people will think they can outsmart the cops, so they’ll likely get the special bracelets, a trip to jail, and have their ride towed away."
