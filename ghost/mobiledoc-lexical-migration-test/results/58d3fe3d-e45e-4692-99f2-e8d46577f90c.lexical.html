<p>Just recently, we unearthed a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/range-rover-p38-trek-edition">second-generation Range Rover</a> draped in enough <em>Kill Bill</em> yellow to blow our minds. We even claimed that, with Rover’s 4.6-liter V8, the 4x4’s power was akin to that of ‘The Bride’, Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman). <br><br>Well, now we’ve discovered this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167158/1987-chevrolet-s10-blazer">1987 Chevrolet Blazer</a>, and it’s even more Hattori Hanzō than anything this side of <em>Vol.1</em>’s unmentionable Chevrolet Silverado, which for TV broadcasts was christened the ‘Party Wagon’. Classy.<br><br><strong>More American Trucks!<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/whalom-park-truck-crosley">Who Remembers This Whalom Park 1951 Crosley Truck?</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/most-evil-truck-mass-produced-lightning">The Most Evil Truck To Ever Be Mass Produced, The Lightning</a><br><br></strong></p>
<p>Besides looking like Beatrix Kiddo in fridge-freezer form, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167158/1987-chevrolet-s10-blazer">this S-10 Blazer</a> boasts some serious torque figures. Under the hood lurks a fresh crate 350 ci V8 powerplant mated to a 700 R4 automatic transmission.</p>

<p>Given a unit transplant roughly four months ago, although the odometer reads 238,679kms, the engine is believed by the owner to have covered only 10k. Barely run in, yet ready for thousands of trouble-free miles. <br><br>Cabin highlights include a Grant steering wheel, Sport Comp Auto Meter oil pressure and temperature gauges, Sony CD player, rear bench seat, air conditioning, and power steering. The interior is trimmed with cloth, paired with leather front sport bucket seats. Chevrolet floor mats round off the interior, which incorporates a sporty yet functional guise. We love it!</p>

<p>For those in Europe who are smitten with the aesthetics of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167158/1987-chevrolet-s10-blazer">this Chevy</a>, you’ll be guaranteed a certain exclusivity. It won’t be to everyone’s taste but, as a first-generation S-10 Blazer, this beast packs some serious retro vibes. <br><br>We have a serious crush on this truck, although we can’t pinpoint exactly why. For those with bouts of 1980s nostalgia, the proportions seem so inherently right. As a compact SUV, we don’t think they come much more passé than an S-10 Blazer.</p>

<p>Should you be searching for the perfect truck that will turn heads without breaching the realms of taste, this offering from GR Auto Gallery may just be your perfect choice. According to the advert it ‘handles very well’, and with such sporting aesthetics, we’d be tempted to test such a claim out.
