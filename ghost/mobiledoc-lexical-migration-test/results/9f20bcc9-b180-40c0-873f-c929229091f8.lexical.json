It’s factory rated at 425-horsepower at 5,000 rpm and 490 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 rpm. Backing that up is the TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission, so there’s no room for driver error when it comes to gear changes. What’s more, there are 4.10 gears in the rear, so this ‘Cuda is definitely a threat on the track. However, with a weight of 3,745 lbs. including the driver, all that power and aggressive gearing is necessary to really get this Hemi ‘Cuda moving.",

Don’t start declaring the ‘Cuda the winner already, because there’s more to this Chevy than those factory specs. With the Turbo 400 3-speed automatic, it’s matched up nicely against the Mopar. Then there’s the set of 4.88 rear gears, making this not so much of a street machine as it is a track slayer. Finally, with the driver inside, the ’69 Chevelle SS tips the scale at 3,690 lbs. for another advantage over the Plymouth.",
