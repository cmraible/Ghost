At $15k, would you be willing to give this V6 American-Italian hybrid a chance?</h3>
<p>The original concept of combining <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167376/1990-chrysler-tc-by-maserati">Chrysler’s powertrain with a Maserati body</a> was met by most automotive enthusiasts with dread. Some proclaimed it was ‘taking the worst from each partner’. <br><br>However, with cars from this era now floated by their own merits, we think this seldom-seen chunk of automotive history makes for quite the bargain at $15k, even if it might not be to everyone's taste. Check out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167376/1990-chrysler-tc-by-maserati">this 1990 Chrysler TC by Maserati</a> up for grabs with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/GR+Auto+Gallery">GR Auto Gallery</a>. <br><br><em><strong>More Maseratis!<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/2016-maserati-quattroporte-shooting-brake">Check Out This 2016 Maserati Quattroporte 3.0 TD Shooting Brake!</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/rare-maserati-quattroporte">Would You Have Bought This Rare Maserati Quattroporte?</a></strong></em><br><br><br><br>As such with any lampooned luxury vehicle, sales were slow. In-house projections poised the TC for annual sales of 10k units, yet barely 7300 examples left the Italian production line over a three-year stretch. Poor trade was attributed to a high price tag ($33k in 1989; $35k in 1990; $37k in 1991), exclusivity problems (the TC was sold only by select Chrysler dealers), and a lack of spec-sheet options.</p>

<p>Further scorn was aimed at the undistinguished performance. Even in 200bhp form, courtesy of a 16-valve 2.2-litre <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Maserati">Maserati</a> engine cast in England by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Ford+Cosworth">Cosworth</a> and finished in Italy, owners had very little to praise. <br><br>However, that was three decades ago. With a platform based on a shortened <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Dodge+Daytona">Dodge Daytona</a> chassis and retro cars now claiming dominance in the collector market, how does the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167376/1990-chrysler-tc-by-maserati">Chrysler TC by Maserati</a> hold up today?</p>

<p>As a slice of bouffant-styled nostalgia, the TC offers a rarity factor unrivalled by competitors of the period. With time’s onward march, an outright lack of speed and inferior design to its American brethren can ultimately be forgiven – for when it comes to the interesting stuff, the TC is king. <br><br>Where else can you find an American-market car that had bodywork produced by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=DeTomaso">DeTomaso</a>-subsidiary Innocenti, with specially designed struts and shock absorbers from Fitchel and Sachs, a Cosworth-built Maserati engine, bespoke wheels crafted by Formula One supplier Fondmental, and Teves anti-lock brakes?</p>

<p>Yet, not all TCs came with the Maserati unit. If only American powerplants will do, you can easily acquire a Chrysler V6 example – such as the 1990 specimen we have here with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167376/1990-chrysler-tc-by-maserati">GR Auto Gallery</a>. <br><br>Only 172 TCs in Arctic White with a Ginger Italian leather cabin were produced for the 1990 model year, making this particular car something of a steal at $15k. It's in rude health, too.</p>
