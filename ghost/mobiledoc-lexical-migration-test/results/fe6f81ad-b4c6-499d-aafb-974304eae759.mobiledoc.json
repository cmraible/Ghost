However, the automaker believes it will gradually secure more chips for cars as the year progresses. It’s worth noting that for 2022 VW fell behind Toyota in global production yet again as the Japanese automaker produced over 2 million more vehicles. Still, Toyota has decreased its production projection in November all thanks to the chip shortage."
