<p>Most people can agree that few things are more terrifying than losing control of your own body. The leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision to overturn<em> Roe v. Wade </em>bolstered this theory this week, stoking deep fear in the hearts and minds of people nationwide.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate to live in a state where access to safe abortion is treated as a fundamental right — where I know decisions about my body, and my right to terminate a pregnancy, are solely mine. Unfortunately, that’s far from the reality for many in our country — and it’s a major problem that crosses lines of class, race, geography, immigration, and more. The impending SCOTUS decision is likely to upend the lives of many low-income people — while the wealthy can expect <a href="https://twitter.com/krystalball/status/1521295066182131712">business as usual</a>. As we highlight in this edition of Weekend Reader, this thread is explored through the raw narrative of Tina Vásquez, a journalist who had an abortion and by doing so, freed herself from a life of self-alienation and lost autonomy.</p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://prismreports.org/2022/05/03/abortion-is-freedom-roe-v-wade/"><strong>Abortion Is Freedom</strong></a></strong>(Prism) — <em>“There is nothing more holy in the world than choosing if, when, or how you create a family, which is why abortion is one of our most sacred rights. I am certain that I have a life I could have only dreamed of as a young person — one devoted to family, community, and storytelling — because at 19 I was able to access abortion care that changed the course of my life. I know there are many people who have children under less-than-ideal circumstances and who go on to have full and fulfilling lives. I also know that would not have been possible for me, and I unapologetically chose myself. Every word I have written, every story I have told, every ounce of joy I’ve experienced is because I had the ability to shape my life the way I wanted. As a journalist, I know we create the public record, and I want the record to show that abortion is freedom.”<br></em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/world/row-v-wade-abortion-decision-american-women-healthcare-nightmare-1608689"><strong>Roe v. Wade Abortion Decision Will Just Plunge More American Women Into Extortionate U.S. Health Care Nightmare</strong></a> (i news) — <em>“As with the rest of American health care, the consequences of restricted access to abortion are more widespread and more dire for poor people and people of colour. The United States guarantees no right to health care. An emergency room has to treat you if you show up bleeding, but they can still send you an astronomical bill and take money directly from your wages, or even have you arrested, if you don’t pay. There is no right to chemotherapy or insulin; no right to see a primary care doctor, let alone an oncologist. Abortion is no different.”<br></em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4aw99b/big-tech-lobbyists-use-trans-people-to-avoid-antitrust-regulation"><strong>Big Tech Lobbyists Use Trans People To Avoid Antitrust Legislation</strong></a> (Vice) — <em>“Earlier this month, the Chamber of Progress — an organization that lobbies on behalf of Big Tech and is run by Google’s former head of policy, called on Sen. Klobuchar and Rep. Cicilline to throw cold water on their own bipartisan antitrust bills: The American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act. The Chamber opportunistically seized on false claims made by Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) and Fox News host Laura Ingraham that antitrust reform is a way to ‘stop woke companies’ from standing up for LGBTQ+ rights. In a letter to Klobuchar and Cicilline, the lobbyists encouraged the lawmakers to denounce Buck’s claims. ‘If antitrust is used to punish companies for speaking up on social justice issues, the result could be a chilling effect on corporate leadership against hate and bigotry,’ the tech lobbyists wrote. That seems reasonable enough on its face, but it could not be more obvious that the Chamber’s goal was not to support LGBTQ+ rights, but rather to undermine legislation that their Big Tech backers oppose.” <br></em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/pakistan-india-heatwaves-water-electricity-shortages"><strong>‘We Are Living In Hell’: Pakistan And India Suffer Extreme Spring Heatwaves</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“As the heatwave has exacerbated massive energy shortages across India and Pakistan, Turbat, a city of about 200,000 residents, now barely receives any electricity, with up to nine hours of load shedding every day, meaning that air conditioners and refrigerators cannot function. ‘We are living in hell,’ said Ahmed. It has been a similar story across the subcontinent, where the realities of climate change are being felt by more than 1.5 billion people as the scorching summer temperatures have arrived two months early and the relief of the monsoons are months away. North-west and central India experienced the hottest April in 122 years, while Jacobabad, a city in Pakistan’s Sindh province, hit 49C on Saturday, one of the highest April temperatures ever recorded in the world.”<br></em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/166321/shrestha-cisneros-climate-candidate"><strong>The Rise Of The No-Compromise Climate Candidate</strong></a> (The New Republic) —<em> “The rise of these candidates is often attributed to a generational shift: Younger people supposedly care more about these issues because the crisis will affect a larger portion of their lives. (We often hear about those driven by climate despair to forgo parenthood entirely.) And some examples do seem to support that thesis: At 28, Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer running on a climate-focused platform for a congressional seat in South Texas, is young, especially compared to her 66-year-old opponent and most of Congress. But many of these candidates are, like Alexis and Shrestha, in their thirties and forties: old enough to remember Al Gore connecting global warming to the heat waves, droughts, flash floods, and forest fires already ravaging the United States in the 1990s and desperate to protect their own and other families from the disasters we’re already experiencing and those yet to come.”<br></em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.gawker.com/politics/the-scourge-of-sentimentality-politics"><strong>The Scourge Of Sentimentality Politics</strong></a> (Gawker) — <em>“For 50 years, conservatives have worked tirelessly towards the repeal of </em>Roe v. Wade<em>. While calling for ‘strict constructivism,’ ‘judicial restraint,’ and denouncing ‘judicial activism,’ they trained and deployed cadres of lawyers as right-wing activists. They gradually took over institutions and then the key institution: the Supreme Court. This required them to adopt Machiavellian means: most of the justices in question swore up and down at their confirmation hearings that they had no designs on </em>Roe<em>, that it was the settled precedent. They were lying. In a certain way it’s a brilliant feat of political will and organization that should be studied. But while the conservative movement has pumped out loyal foot soldiers who understood that the cause was the main thing, liberals have gotten caught up in the hagiography of their leading functionaries, making everyone involved forget that they are part of a larger movement and not the ends in themselves.”<br></em></p>

Reactors are by far the most reliable source of electricity in existence, producing tremendous volumes of power 24/7 from relatively tiny nuggets of mined uranium, unlike solar panels and wind turbines that require vast operations and huge amounts of metal, and can prove less reliable in cloudy, windless weather. But nuclear power has very high upfront costs and the building process is slow. It’s also politically unpopular, in no small part because of the threat posed by radioactive waste.”<br></em></p>

At one end are the NatCons, post-liberals, and traditionalist figures like Benedict Option author Rod Dreher, who envision a conservatism reinvigorated by an embrace of localist values, religious identity, and an active role for the state in promoting everything from marriage to environmental conservation. But there’s also a highly online set of Substack writers, podcasters, and anonymous Twitter posters — ’our true intellectual elite,’ as one podcaster describes them. This group encompasses everyone from rich crypto bros and tech executives to back-to-the-landers to disaffected members of the American intellectual class, like Up in the Air author Walter Kirn, whose fulminations against groupthink and techno-authoritarianism have made him an unlikely champion to the dissident right and heterodox fringe. But they share a the basic worldview: that individualist liberal ideology, increasingly bureaucratic governments, and big tech are all combining into a world that is at once tyrannical, chaotic, and devoid of the systems of value and morality that give human life richness and meaning — as Blake Masters recently put it, a ‘dystopian hell-world.’”<br></em></p>

Internal emails reviewed by HuffPost show that these letters all had something in common: They were ghostwritten by lobbyists and consultants of the two major pipeline firms behind those projects. The communications show how Williams Companies Inc. and TC Energy Corporation worked to boost political support for a number of natural gas infrastructure projects currently under federal review to fill a void left behind by Dominion Energy and Duke Energy’s canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline.”<br></em></p>

His VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz, controls billions more in capital and is a major force in guiding the next generation of well-heeled start-ups. Regularly lionized as a titan of the tech-mogul class, both an OG innovator and an astute investor, Andreessen is helping to lead the web3 charge as his firm plunks down billions on crypto companies. He seems to live well: In the last six-plus months, he’s spent $255 million on three homes in Malibu. He ticks some of the other popularity metrics: a million Twitter followers, a regular on the conference and speaking circuit, a member of the Internet Hall of Fame. He’s donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Republicans, and he has the ear of fellow billionaires including Elon Musk. Andreessen is a big deal — a tech, business, and political power player — in whatever sense that still matters. For Andreessen, it doesn’t seem to matter all that much. This putative titan of industry has spent the past week tweeting about how he and some of his fellow billionaires are less powerful than one might think.” <br></em></p>

It’s Profiting From Inflation, And You’re Paying For It.</strong></a> (The New York Times) —<em> “Executives from the nation’s largest publicly traded companies had a lot to report to their shareholders about supply chain snarls, product shortages and rising prices — mostly that they were very good for business. What was striking in the earnings calls was not the supply chain shortages or companies’ typical profit motives; it was the plain old corporate profiteering. The Economics 101 adage that ‘inflation is just too much money chasing too few goods’ doesn’t come close to the full story. This raises the question: When companies are exploiting consumers in a time of national crisis, when should government step in?”<br></em></p>
