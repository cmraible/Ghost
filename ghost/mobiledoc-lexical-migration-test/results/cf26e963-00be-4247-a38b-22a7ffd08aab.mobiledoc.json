Yes, not all of them have lightning-fast reflexes, some of their launches are less than stellar, and driver skill absolutely plays a factor on the track. That’s part of the fun of racing is it’s not just the machine doing the work. But if you want to make excuses about why the muscle car you swear can pull 9s with bolt-on mods gets roasted by a rival, the driver is a convenient target of your wrath and embarrassment."

Of course, that might be why the Civic boy racers don’t want to show up there – that and they’ll lose every time."
