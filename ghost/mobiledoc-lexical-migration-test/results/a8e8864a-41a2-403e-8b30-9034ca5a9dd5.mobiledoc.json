When it comes to muddy hill climbs, a muscle car is about the last vehicle we’d pick for the job, but someone obviously thought otherwise. Wearing comically oversized tires and sporting many other mods, the MUDstang is one of the most pointless utilitarian machines we’ve seen in a while."

Most importantly, those upgrades probably mean more low-end torque, or at least it should if the guy wants to use the pony for off-roading. He does mention the engine is making about 1,200-horsepower."

In fact, we’ve seen plenty of Mustangs riding on big tires, but usually the car’s on a truck chassis that’s jacked up. That certainly is a difference with this build. It’s also worth noting the name “MUDstang” has been used in the past, so that’s not even new. However, the video is entertainingly weird, so have at it and enjoy."
