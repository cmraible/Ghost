<hr>
<p>The <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/96488/10849840">Aston Martin Vanquish</a> is one of the most predominant examples of high-class automotive technology and style we can see in modern times. In 2016, the European luxury brand outdid itself with this particular vehicle being a great representation of that. Across the body, you will find many pieces of evidence to back that claim such as the Volante Carbon White exterior package. One of the major parts of that package happened to be tasteful carbon fiber inserts which you can find all over the exterior and that just me be the first hint you pick up on suggesting great performance capabilities.</p>

<p>There's a whole lot more where that came from with the Vanquish's body having been designed as an equilibrium of aerodynamics and <a href="https://www.hendersonauctions.com/auction/collector-motor-series-auction-saturday-october-30th/">high-class style</a>. It might also be quite a bit lighter than you expected and those shiny 10-spoke 20-inch wheels seal the deal quite nicely. Behind those Wheels you'll find carbon ceramic brakes, these are very important when you're taking on Sharp turns and slowing from high speeds as supercars are usually known to do. Of course, no description of a car's performance would be complete without an overview of the powertrain.</p>

<p>Within the engine bay of this Aston Martin Vanquish sits a 6 L V12 engine, the massive power maker utilizes every cubic inch of displacement at its disposal to make sure you always have enough horsepower and torque to get the job done. Together, this engine is capable of producing 568 horsepower, a hefty number to say the least. The cherry on top is the fact that only 32,500 miles are shown on the odometer which means you'll get to enjoy the car as much as you want to for yours to come without having to worry about stuff breaking too soon. Overall, the Vanquish is the Pinnacle of luxury and speed which is exactly why you should consider getting behind the wheel.</p>
