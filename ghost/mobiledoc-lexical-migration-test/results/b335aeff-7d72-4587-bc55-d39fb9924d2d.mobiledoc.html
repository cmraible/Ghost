<p>I first posted it <a href="http://adam.vox.com/library/post/this-is-what-we-do.html">over on Vox</a> last Friday after spotting it <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2007/02/02/web-20-the-machine-is-using-us/">on Stephanie’s blog</a>, and fully intended to post about it here over the weekend. And then got overwhelmed by the amount of decorating we had to do. Ah, well.
