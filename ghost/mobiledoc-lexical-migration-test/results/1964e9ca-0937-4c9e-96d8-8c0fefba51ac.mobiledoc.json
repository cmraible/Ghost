At the time we theorized one possible explanation for the insane move was that the guy could see the floodwaters were rising and his C8 was trapped, so he decided to chance driving it out instead of dealing with its assured destruction. Now we have a glimpse of a whole underground garage of exotic and luxury "

From the grime left behind by the water, it’s apparent it reached at least five feet in depth, maybe even higher. In case you’re wondering, most exotic supercars aren’t anywhere near that tall, so they were either completely submerged or floating in the muck."

Workers have windows and one of the back hatches open, a generator probably running a pump is heard running in the background, there’s still plenty of water on the floor, and the whole scene is pretty horrific."
