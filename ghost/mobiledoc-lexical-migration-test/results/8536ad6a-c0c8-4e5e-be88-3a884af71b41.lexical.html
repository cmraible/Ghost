<p>Vans are some of the most overlooked classic vehicles out there, with many people writing them off as boring boxes on wheels. However, in 1960s and 1970s America there was a battle for the top spot in commercial vehicles, leading to some rather stylish designs. This modified 1965 Dodge A100 van, up for grabs with <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28063/1965-dodge-d100?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">GAA Auctions</a>, is a great example.<br><br><em><strong>More American Classics<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/american-movie-cars" rel="noopener">- American Movie Cars</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/willys-jeep-wwii" rel="noopener">- 1945 WWII Willys Jeep Could Be Yours For $20k</a><br><br><br></strong></em></p>
<p>Far from boring, this sub-lime green A100 comes with bags of character. Its vibrant shade plays homage to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Dodge/">Dodge’s</a> eye-catching muscle cars of the era, with the silhouette of a Dodge Charger Daytona emblazoned down its length.</p>
<p>Various contours and those big round headlights share with the D100 pickup makes this van far less anonymous than some of its rivals. It certainly has enough presence to compete with the ever-popular Volkswagen Type 2.</p>
<p>This Dodge A100 is far from stock with its bright bodywork hiding a 360 Ci V8 motor. We bet you weren’t expecting that! The power output is unspecified, but the power-to-weight ratio will be pretty impressive when not full of cargo. <br></p>

<p>A 727 automatic transmission channels power to a Mopar 8 3/4 rear end that can handle this van’s newfound performance. The new side-exit exhaust pipe is also a nice touch on this build.</p>
<p>The interior, as with all vans, is pretty spartan. A pair of black seats contrasts the vast amounts of green and face a simplistic dashboard. We do like the addition of music posters from the period that have been pinned up in the back. The cargo area itself is pretty large for a compact van, making this just about the most practical classic you can buy.</p>
<p>Heading to auction without reserve, this hot rod van not only looks the part, but will surprise its critics with the beating heart of a muscle car. It hits the block on 25 July 2019.</p>
