<h3 id="this-iconic-anime-adapted-replica-is-based-on-a-1980-corvette-and-looks-in-fine-fettle-ready-for-its-new-owner">This iconic anime-adapted replica is based on a 1980 Corvette and looks in fine fettle ready for its new owner</h3>
<p>The discerning enthusiasts amongst you will just about recognise the form and interior of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=C3+Corvette">C3 Corvette</a> underneath this convincing Mach Five replica car.</p>
<p><em>Speed Racer</em> was an anime adaption from a comic produced in Japan during the 1960s, which later became the TV series upon which this car is based. The original 52 episodes aired between 1967 and 1968 to much acclaim. A rerun aired back in 2008, tieing in with the Hollywood remake starring Emile Hirsch and John Goodman.</p>

<p>Despite its anime origins, the car was never depicted to go at the supersonic speeds its name would suggest; even for anime that may have been beyond the realms of plausibility.</p>
<p>What we have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/2686/1980-z-movie-car-speed-racer-mach-5">here</a>, however, is a particularly convincing replica of the car complete with all the decals, swoops and bulges you’d expect. It's offered by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Ideal+Classic+Cars">Ideal Classic Cars</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of recorded mileage from the vendor, judging by the fit and finish of the vehicle, along with that absolutely pristine interior, we would assume a negligible distance has been covered, or a sumptuous refit at some point recently.</p>
<p>Look closer at the steering wheel and fans of the anime will recognise the centre boss instantly. The six letters surrounding the letter G denote the cars alleged capabilities and was its defining feature for the series.</p>
<p>The most interesting of these options includes button B, which offers up tires that bend the laws of physics with some pragmatic flexing. In addition, some 5000 horsepower is offered to each of the car's tires. That’s some power.</p>
<p>The second is Frogger Mode, selected via button F. A feature that allows the Mach Five to become an amphibious vehicle. Upon its use, oxygen engulfs the cabin which somehow makes the unthinkable possible.</p>
<p>If you’ve been after a particularly accurate and quality replica of this iconic car, then hesitate no more, as these rarely come up for sale.</p>
