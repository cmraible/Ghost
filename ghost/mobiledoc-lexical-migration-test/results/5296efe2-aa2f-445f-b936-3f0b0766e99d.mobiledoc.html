<p>Since all the cool car shows are on hiatus due to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nhr/">COVID-19</a>, car enthusiasts are having to come up with creative ways to get their fix. <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/auctions/4-DE84I/motorious-convertibles-only-online-auction">Online auctions</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/national-corvette-museum-online-car-show/">virtual car shows</a> are great, and now <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-jaguar-land-rover-backgrounds/">Jaguar</a> is teaming up with the <a href="https://svra.com/">Sportscar Vintage Racing Association</a> to give us a look inside the garages of some top collectors in a new series of videos. The first of which just went live showing the impressive collection of Scott Holley, a classic car collector and vintage racer from Indiana.</p>

<p>Holley spent 30 years racing Porsches before retiring and amassing a collection of around 30 cars including a 1969 Boss 302, a handful of Cobras and a trio of Vipers, but when his wife got tired of muscle cars, he made her happy by adding a collection of vintage Jaguars. As always, it starts with a single car, and in Holley's case, the Jaguar bug started with a one-owner 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1971-jaguar-e-type-v12-auction/">E-Type</a> Roadster painted in Willow Green with just 29,000 miles on the odometer.</p>
<p>In addition to this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jaguar-e-type-fulfills-mans-childhood-wish/">E-Type</a>, Holley's Jaguar collection also includes a 1967 E-Type, 1960 Mark IX, 1967 S-Type and a 1956 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Jaguar/XK140">XK140</a> MC restored bard find. Attached to this garage is a race shop, which houses even more classics including an E-Type coupe that matches his wife's roadster making for a lovely his-and-her set of E-Types! Also in this area is a race-prepped '63 E-Type that was formerly part of the <a href="http://donovanmotorcars.com/vintageracing.html">Donovan Motorsports</a> collection of vintage race cars.</p>
