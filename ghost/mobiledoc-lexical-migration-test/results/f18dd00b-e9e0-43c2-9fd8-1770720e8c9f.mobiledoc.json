          "Tiny World Racing features slick controls and a stand-out local couch multiplayer experience. The best part of this top-down racer is that it gives me an excuse to whip out the old Mario Kart wheel accessories and play with the tiny joysticks in my gargantuanly oversized hands. It feels natural plugging and playing on the big screen with somebody else but if you try to go for a solo experience, there’s not a whole lot of incentive – we’ll get onto that in the ‘bad’ section. Nonetheless, booting it up and giving it a whirl with a mate or some family around the TV is a tonne of fun but realistically, you probably already have some triple-A racing games with more features and more multiplayer incentives."

          " shines as something that would feel at home on a site like Miniclip rather than on Nintendo’s handheld. Being able to boot it up and play it on a television surely gives it an edge but the translation from small to big screen isn’t perfect. Depending on your perspective, there’s also a shortage of incentives as the developers have opted to give everything to the player off the bat – this could be a good thing if you enjoy a neat package of content that you get from the start but it means that, rather quickly, there’s little to do beyond swirling around the tracks, with no levels to progress, no characters to uncheck or no cosmetics to slap on (edit: Chequered Ink has advised that a future update will include 20 news tracks that are required to be unlocked through the main campaign). What you get is what you get which makes the burnout not at all a paradise.  "
