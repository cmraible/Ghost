These incredible vehicles have proven to that world the ability of a dedicated group of enthusiasts with a passion for sticking to the norm. So it's easy to see why these cars might be the perfect choice for any rapper looking for a marvelous centerpiece in their music video. One such musician, Nipsey Hussie, had the same idea when filming the video for \"Higher,\" in which this impala was a significant character. With Ice Cube also using the vehicle for \"Good Cop, Bad Cop,\" it's clear that this low rider is special.",

Even the radiator, which the builder admits he would have customarily swapped for a performance brand, remains on the vehicle. Every corner of this incredible classic custom is what you should look at, as the hydraulic shocks allow the car to bounce up and down like it's dancing. \"So what kind of crazy tricks can this flamboyant vintage luxury car perform?\" you might ask?",

This art form is about finding the car's rhythm, according to the owner who designed the vehicle and built it with his six-year-old daughter. All of this makes this 1964 Chevrolet Impala a unique car that will likely only be experienced by this dedicated driver, and we applaud his accomplishment. ",
