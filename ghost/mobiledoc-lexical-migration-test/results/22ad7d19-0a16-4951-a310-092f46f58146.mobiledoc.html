Here's your chance to add one to your collection.</h3>

<p>Known as the "ladybug" in Japan, the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0155-1970-subaru-360-police-car/820894?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Subaru 360</a> was often referred to in America as a "Japanese Beetle" when it was exported here starting in 1968, toward the end of its 12-year production run.</p>
<p>About 10,000 <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0155-1970-subaru-360-police-car/820894?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Subaru 360s</a> made their way to America. That's impressive, considering America's love affair with large cars during that time period.</p>

<p>Everything about the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0155-1970-subaru-360-police-car/820894?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Subaru 360</a> is small. It's less than ten feet long, just over four feet wide, and around four and a half feet tall. It's powered by a 360cc two-stroke twin producing just 25 horsepower, and the entire car weighs in at around 1,000 pounds.</p>

Someone clearly has a sense of humor. With a zero to 60 time of roughly 37 seconds, this won't be catching speeders any time soon.</p>

<p>That's just fine, though – <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0155-1970-subaru-360-police-car/820894?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this unusual little car</a> is beloved by its fans for many reasons. It was instrumental in mobilizing postwar Japan, and it gave Subaru an early foothold in the United States. Every WRX, Outback, and Legacy in America owes a debt of gratitude to the Subaru 360.</p>
<p>There's the styling, too. It has <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0155-1970-subaru-360-police-car/820894?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">an adorable, insect-like shape</a> that's instantly endearing. Plus, there's something inherently charming about things that are smaller than they should be.</p>
