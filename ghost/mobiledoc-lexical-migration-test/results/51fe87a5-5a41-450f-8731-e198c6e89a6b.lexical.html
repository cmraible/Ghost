<h2 id="newsletter-subject-lines">Newsletter subject lines</h2>
<p>Newsletter subject lines are the first point of contact between you and the reader. They can make or break every issue of the newsletter ‚Äî and, by extension, the newsletter itself. </p>
<p>It's crucial that you understand and get good at writing subject lines that matter to and resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>So, what makes a good subject line? </p>
<p>The answer is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Depends.</p>
<p>Sorry for the less than useful, but sadly it's clear that something that's a pretty sure fire success for one group of people won't work for another, as they'll see it irritating or ‚Äúclickbaity‚Äù.</p>
<p>In other words, what works in subjects is both <strong>subjective</strong> and <strong>personal</strong>.</p>
<p>Grabbing a guide to great email subject headlines from the internet is something of a gamble. If you find one that happens to match the instincts of your target audince ‚Äî then great. But otherwise, you're just trying off-the-shelf solutions that are likely to harm your open rates. </p>
<p>That's not to say that there aren't some more general rules we can explore. In the end though, it's going to come down to experimentation and testing within these guidlines. We'll look at testing later on in this page, and return to it in the analytics section. </p>

<h3 id="personal-works">Personal works</h3>
<p>Email, at its best, is a very personal medium. Things that make the newsletter sound personal tend to work well. Use of ‚Äúyou‚Äù when you can work it into the subject line can be effective. </p>
<p>Beware of straying into chatty ‚Äî unless you're sure a casual tone of voice works for your audience (see Voice in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/newsletters-the-basics/">Newsletter Basics</a>).</p>
<h3 id="newsy-headlines-work">Newsy headlines work</h3>
<p>With in-box triage, people are always looking for things they can either:</p>
<ol>
    <li>delete now</li>
    <li>put off reading</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can give people a topical reason for opening the newsletter, you're much more likely to get them to both actually open it, and to successfully transition from ‚Äútriage‚Äù mode to ‚Äúreading mode‚Äù. </p>
<p>And let's face it ‚Äî in many cases news is the competitive advantage that editorial newsletters have over marketing ones in the battle for attention. Let's use it. </p>
<h3 id="shorter-is-better">Shorter is better</h3>
<p>This is just a matter of practicality: think how most people are consuming their newsletters. They're browsing through an inbox, making triage decisions on what matters and what doesn't. And they're looking at a list like this:</p>

<p>You've probably got <strong>around six words</strong> ‚Äî at the most ‚Äî to trigger the reader's interest. That doesn't mean that the <em>entire</em> headline needs to fit into the six words, but enough of it to intrigue the recipient ‚Äî tease them into wanting to find out more.</p>
<p>Looking above, for example, the <em>WTF is SEO?</em> newsletter does a good job, with ‚ÄúWe saw bonkers search traffic‚Ä¶‚Äù being the sort of thing that is likely to draw any journalist's eye‚Ä¶</p>
<p>However, Charlie Warzel's ‚ÄúAir Will Find A Way‚Äù is dependent on the extracted text to sell its meaning ‚Äî and you can't rely on all recipients having that turned on. </p>
<h3 id="useful-can-be-useful">Useful can be useful</h3>
<p>For newsletters in the business space, suggesting the utility of the newsletter can have a <a href="https://ghost.org/blog/how-to-increase-email-newsletter-open-rate/">huge impact on the open rates</a>:</p>
<blockquote>For example, Ghost‚Äôs Publisher Weekly newsletter experienced an increase in open rates when the subject lines included ‚Äúhow to‚Äù statements. By using this phrasing more frequently, the newsletter now has a consistent open rate of at least 43%.</blockquote>
<p>(The whole article is worth a read for its advice on boosting open rates.)</p>
<h3 id="the-more-contentious-elements-%F0%9F%A4%94">The more contentious elements ü§î</h3>
<p>Some people <em>love</em> emoji in their emails. Some hate it. </p>
<p>Some people love humour or quirky headlines. Some hate it. </p>
<p>You'll only be able to figure this out througha. combination of your existing knowledge of you audience and ‚Äî if you're lucky enough to use a platform that provides it ‚Äî A/B Testing. We'll talk more about that below.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-the-word-%E2%80%9Cnewsletter%E2%80%9D">Avoid the word ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù</h3>
<p>There's <a href="https://www.editorgroup.com/blog/great-email-subject-line/">some evidence</a> that using the word ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù can drop open rates by up to 20%. This might seem counter-intuitive when the entire journalism world seems to be afire with exicitment about them. But, again, put yourself in the position of someone triaging their in-box. The word ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù immediatly suggests something you can put off reading. </p>
<p>Avoid it. </p>
<h3 id="avoid-spammy-words">Avoid Spammy Words</h3>
<p>The spam filter is your biggest danger for any newsletter. There are a tonne of ‚Äúspammy words‚Äù that make it much more likely you will get caught in by those filters. Many of them are obvious:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Act now</li>
    <li>Limited time</li>
    <li>Urgent</li>
</ul>
<p>But others are ones you might not consider and have good reasons for using:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bargain</li>
    <li>Guarantee</li>
    <li>Won</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a good list of <a href="https://journeys.autopilotapp.com/blog/email-spam-trigger-words/">words to avoid</a>.</p>
<h3 id="headline-analyzers">Headline Analyzers</h3>
<p>There are some tools out there which can analyse your headlines and make suggestions based on them. I <em>strongly</em> advise against taking these as gospel, but they can be worth using to challenge your own assumptions if you're stuck in an open rate rut:</p>

<h2 id="ab-testing">A/B Testing</h2>
<p>This is an <em>incredibly</em> valuable tool, is you have access to it. Not many of the emergent newsletter platforms do, though, sadly.</p>
<p>In essence, this allows you to segment your newsletter audience, and send one of them a newsletter with, say, a more casual subject line, and the other a more business-like headline. You can then compare open rates between the two, and use that to help refine your sense of the sorts of subject line that work for you audience.</p>
<p>It's the single most useful tool you use to helop refine your understanding of your audience and what works for them, which is why it baffles me that it's available on so many marketing automation platforms, but not editorial newsletter ones. </p>
<p>That said, there are a few caveats worth noting:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The tool works better with larger groups rather than small ones, as that reduces oddities thrown up by an uneven spread of the types of subscriber in each group. </li>
    <li>Some things are easier to A/B test that others (see below).</li>
    <li>A/B testing can be risky ‚Äî if you're not cautious in your tests, you run the risk of annoying one of the test groups and losing subscribers as a result. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tests-you-should-be-running">Tests you should be running</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Subject lines</strong> ‚Äî measured through open rates. You can vary the complete subject line, the word order of the subject line, its length, its tone and so on. </li>
    <li><strong>Intros</strong> ‚Äî what style of intro works best for your audience? Look at the options we discussed in the structure section, and consider runing tests. You'll probably measure through aggregate click-through rates or by running long-term tests, with two separate but consistent segments, and see how open rates shift over time. </li>
    <li><strong>Images</strong> ‚Äî Do your readers prefer image-rich emails, or do they like to get down to basics with the text? You'll probably measure through aggregate click-through rates or by running long-term tests, with two separate but consistent segments, and see how open rates shift over time. </li>
    <li><strong>Timing</strong> ‚Äî Measured through open rates and click-through rates. Getting timing right for newsletters can be critical. If you have two theories about the best time to send, then split your audience, and test which time slot gets the better open and click-through rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-advanced-tests">More Advanced Tests</h3>
<p>These are tests that you need to run over longer periods of time (weeks to months), and which carry a greater element of risk. Why risk? You are likely to lose some subscribers from the group which has the less successful alternative.</p>
<p>Generally, I advise sticking to set periods for most editorial testing ‚Äî but not for these sorts of newsletter testing. <em>As soon as a clear pattern emerges, end the test, and standardise on the more popular option. </em></p>
<p>Your list is <em>everything;</em> tests which unduly harm it are a poor trade.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tone and Voice</strong> ‚Äî We talked a lot about this in the basic section. If you dobn't have a strong sense of what does work, then test it! Split your group, send newsletters with two different styles of writing, and explore which ones deliver more opens or clickthroughs, ow hich have the lowest churn. </li>
    <li><strong>Length</strong> ‚Äî measured by click-through rates. How long is right for your audience? You have infinite space, but your reader doesn't have infinite time. Do they prefer short and snappy, or extensive and explorable?</li>
    <li><strong>Newsletter Structure</strong> ‚Äî do different elements of your newsletter work better in different places? Can you draw people deeper through it by placing a popular element further down? Split your audience, and test which structure leads to higher open rates or clickthrough rates. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, sadly, the value of this tool is likely to diminish for some of these areas, especially subject line analysis, in the near future. With the move towards blocking open rate tracking for privacy purposes, its use in subject line testing (which is mainly measured through open rates) become less useful.</p>
<p>You could find a way around that by, for example, keeping the structure of both emails identical, change the subject line, and compare the aggregate click-throughs from the subject lines variants. That <em>should</em> give you some indication of which of the two subject lines work better.</p>
