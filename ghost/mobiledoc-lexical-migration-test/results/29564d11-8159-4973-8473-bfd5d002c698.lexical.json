He plans to check the plugs and test the compression to see if the motor is compromised or if it can even drive 'One of those 500 miles.' Then, he intends on juicing the battery life up to get it cranking and see if there’s any transmission issues. Derek also plans to search the Internet for a new set of wheels, seeing as the “Donut from the 80s” does not emit any sort of confidence on that Chevelle.",
