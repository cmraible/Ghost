<p>Some of you are in areas where <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">lockdowns</a> are very much still in effect, while others are in areas where you can go some places but car meets, shows, etc. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-cancelled/">definitely aren’t happening</a> at the moment. We get it: sometimes it’s great to go somewhere and just ogle a bunch of amazing-looking cars. You don’t have to buy them or even get near any of them, but it’s nice to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorious-plays-favorites/">just admire the look</a> of some well cared-for classics. That’s what the video attached to this post is all about.</p>
<p>There are so many amazing cars you’ll probably find yourself hitting pause over and over so you can really drink it all in, especially at the beginning. There’s a little bit of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/worst-diy-car-modifications/">something for everyone</a>, whether you’re in to Mopar muscle, Corvettes, Ford Mustangs, Bel Airs, and more.</p>
<p>Some of the big highlights include a blue <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/boss-302-after-25-years/">Boss 302 Mustang</a> sitting in the showroom. There’s also a ’55 Chevy convertible, ’56 Chevy coupe, two 1993 Mustang Cobras, Chevelle, and Challenger. All of these look especially pristine sitting in the showroom, but of course this dealer seems to have quite a few other attractive options.</p>
<p>When we say there’s a little bit of something for everyone, we mean it. That includes a 1994 Chevy Caprice wagon with some of the wildest pinstriping and flames you’ve ever seen, plus spotlights on both sides and some flashy chrome aftermarket wheels. For those who might have more discerning tastes, there are multiple Chevelles, a GTO, several solid Mopars, and a whole line of C3 Corvettes.</p>
<p>As this dealer which made this video, Maple Motors, describes itself, it’s located in the “heart” of Tennessee. For those who don’t know, that’s St. Hendersonville. If you’re nowhere near there, you probably have some interesting dealers not too far away, which can be a way to get out of the house and see some classic rides in person.</p>
