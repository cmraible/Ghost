How about &#8220;borrowed&#8221; look?</p>\n<p>Yes, the Facebookification of Twitter continues.</p>\n<p>In an announcement posted this morning <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2014/coming-soon-a-whole-new-you-in-your-twitter-profile\">on the company&#8217;s blog</a>, Twitter designer David Bellona showed us the future of Twitter profiles. And that future looks an awful lot like the present for that <em>other</em> large social network.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/twitter-profile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-36792\" alt=\"twitter-profile\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/twitter-profile-300x238.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/twitter-profile-300x238.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/twitter-profile.jpg 555w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Check out First Lady Michelle Obama&#8217;s revamped Twitter profile on the right. Much like Facebook, the header image is larger, and is overlapped by the user&#8217;s photo. That photo is found in the top-left portion of the profile, above the content; coincidentally, this is also where Facebook profile photos are located.</p>\n<p>Oh, and tweets can be &#8220;pinned,&#8221; much like status updates can be &#8220;highlighted&#8221; on Facebook.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that Twitter hasn&#8217;t brought anything original to the table. The company plans to introduce a feature that makes your most engaged-with tweets &#8220;slightly larger&#8221; than the rest. There will also be some fancier filtering options available on profile pages, including the ability to view all tweets, tweets with pictures/video, or tweets mixed with replies to other users.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s tough to shake just how similar Twitter&#8217;s new look is to Facebook&#8217;s profile pages. Take a look below at the profiles of tween sensation/adult nightmare Zac Efron, for example.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/facebook-twitter.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36793\" alt=\"facebook-twitter\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/facebook-twitter.png\" width=\"849\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/facebook-twitter.png 849w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/facebook-twitter-254x300.png 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They look a lot alike, don&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if Facebook has anything to say once Twitter really starts rolling these new-look profiles out. To start, they&#8217;re only available to a small subset of users, including celebrities like Channing Tatum, John Legend and Floyd Mayweather.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that this new look will only show up on the Web for the time being. It&#8217;s unknown at this point if Twitter plans to adapt its new profile design for clients like the official Twitter mobile app, or TweetDeck. We&#8217;ll keep our ears to the ground and let you know if we hear anything.</p>\n<p>What do you think of Twitter&#8217;s new profile design? Love it? Hate it?
