This time, I have the time and flexibility to consider other modes of travel ‚Äî namely, by sea. But what is the most environmentally friendly way to travel? I was leaning towards taking a freighter or a repositioning cruise, but have since been told that those are no better (or possibly even worse!) than flying. How do they really stack up?"

As an expat, never traveling internationally isn't an option, and I try to limit flights to once a year. But I've also often wondered about the fallacy of putting too much weight on individual choices rather than on political and social change. On the other hand, the carbon footprint even for a single transatlantic flight is simply enormous. How to think about this?"
