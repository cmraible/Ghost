We don’t know if this one has been modified, but that’s always a possibility. The rear-wheel-drive layout is pretty old school, making it a little hard to get a good portion of that power to the tires, not to mention prevent wheelspin from a standstill. The driver needs to be fairly skilled to manage this Mopar, especially if it comes with the manual transmission."

That might be oversimplifying things a bit, but the fact it boasts a fairly advanced all-wheel-drive system does make it easier to hook up and get down the track in a hurry. The hand-built turbocharged V6 engine is a masterpiece with somewhere around 565-600-hp on tap, depending on the model. However, that mill takes to aggressive modifications quite well, and we don’t know if anything on these Godzillas has been tweaked."
