This method of course works well if you’re in a more rural area, which was the case with this Dodge Charger running from an Arkansas State Police trooper. However, the second element necessary for this technique to really work is you need a dark vehicle, preferably one with a matte finish. Instead, the white paint on the Mopar made it like a beacon even with the lights turned off.",
