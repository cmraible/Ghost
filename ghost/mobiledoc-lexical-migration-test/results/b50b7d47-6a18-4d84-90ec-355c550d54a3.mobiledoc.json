Strope wondered what it would’ve been like had Ford and Martini Racing got together to dominate the rally racing scene in Europe back in the day. It’s a compelling thought which has resulted in an equally interesting build. And as the man himself observes right at the beginning of the video, he’s a true car nut through and through, not just going through a phase."
