<p>Nickey Chevrolet, also known as "Nickey Chicago", was the biggest  bowtie dealership in the world back in the day that specialized in  unique, high-performance muscle car builds and sales. The parts  department also doubled as a massive speed shop where they turned normal  muscle cars into potent powerhouses. A customer can buy a muscle car  from the Nickey dealership, and Nickey would modify it to their liking.  The Nickey dealership was sold in 1973 and renamed Keystone Chevrolet,  but those who built the performance cars started their own location that  was named "Nickey Chicago", but they closed their doors in 1977. Fast  forward to 2002, and the legal rights and trademarks to the Nickey name  were bought by Stefano Bimbi, a muscle car collector. That is when  Nickey Performance was born, and the company still operates today.</p>
<p>Blanketed in gleaming Grotto Blue with stunning chrome accents, the  exterior of this '68 Chevelle Malibu is in fantastic condition.  Tastefully breaking up the blue paint is a black vinyl roof framed with  chrome trim. Peek inside to a matching blue interior complete with blue  bench seats. Further complementing the exterior is a set of Cragar  wheels wrapped with Firestone Redline tires.</p>
<p>Tucked inside the engine bay is the original numbers-matching 327cui  L79 V8 engine equipped with a Nickey-installed dual-plane aluminum  intake and Holley 4-barrel carburetor. Generating 325-horsepower, power  is shifted down to the 12-bolt 4:10 Positraction rear end via a Muncie  4-speed manual transmission. This classic Chevelle stil retains the  signature Nickey white headers, and it was supertuned with performance  parts by Nickey Chicago.</p>
