As part of the process, the supercar was fitted with a full Tubi Inconel LM Competition exhaust system. The material Inconel has been used in F1 racing for some time now because it’s thin, lightweight, and extremely heat-resistant. While that sounds great, the metal is difficult to shape, so fabricating anything out of it requires considerable effort and that means a much higher cost."

After a short intro which shows off the car from different angles as it’s parked in a garage, we finally get to hear the exhaust at WOT and it’s truly beautiful. From there, the video is just the F40 being driven on the street with that lovely exhaust note to serenade you. Check it out and enjoy."
