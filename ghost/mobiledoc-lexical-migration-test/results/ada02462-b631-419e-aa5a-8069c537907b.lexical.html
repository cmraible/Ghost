Usually plastered with lashings of modifications, this one is different – and all the better for it</h3>
<p>When it comes to early Firebirds, there are typically two directions people take with their F-body: restore it to showroom condition or adapt the muscle car for street/drag racing prowess.</p>
<p>While it certainly does happen, it’s not often that you stumble across a 1969 Firebird in flawlessly restored condition. It remains rarer still to find a blower hidden under the hood, along with supporting modifications to boot. Yet, that's the exact description of the example we just ran across <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1969-pontiac-firebird-11/">for sale</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few things to note about this car before diving into things that give it some extra grunt. First thing – it appears to be a Trans Am clone. Back in 1969, cars weren’t given a VIN that broke information down specifically with trim levels or engine options. It’s also important to mention that this is not a perfect car, it does have some paint chips and things of the sort, but the restoration was definitely completed to very high professional standards.</p>

<p>The seller bought the car in this condition four years ago. Prior to that, the F-Body was restored 13 years back, installed with a stroked 467ci Poncho engine (bonus points for not being LS-swapped) force-fed by a Paxton blower.</p>
<p>Outfitted with a FiTech Go EFI 8 fuel injection system, MSD ignition and distributor, upgraded radiator, and throaty exhaust, the extra mechanical support gives the beefy engine dollops of extra performance.</p>
<p>Backing the engine is a Tremec TKO 600 five-speed manual transmission that funnels power to a 3.55:1 geared posi-traction rearend, where 610-horsepower and 690 lbs-ft of torque then meet the rear wheels.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, when sorting through feedback about the car, the biggest complaint in the slightly larger 18-inch aftermarket wheels, with one person citing they prefer the 'purity of form'. However, the car’s powertrain is already a bit of a contradiction to the show car appearance, but then again, that’s a marker of a great restomod build.</p>
