The Rondine – pronounced 'Ron-din-ay' – was a design concept produced by Pininfarina for the 1963 Paris Motor Show which couldn’t have looked further removed from the car that bore it – a C2-series Chevrolet Corvette. While not conceived with mass production in mind, it eventually spawned a mainstream production car. It’s just that it wasn’t American. Fiat tasked the firm’s stylist Tom Tjaarda with reworking some of its styling cues for the new 124 Spider. The job was made that much more difficult by the trifling matter of the Italian roadster having a much smaller canvas to work with."

The Turin styling house produced a vision of beauty with design cues cherry picked from the marque’s more recent competition endeavours: the roofline was pure 330 Le Mans coupé, the shark-nose a nod to contemporaneous Formula 1 and Dino sports-racers. This super-glam super-coupé was unveiled at the 1962 Paris Salon – and even then, it was late arriving on the Ferrari stand. However, this was no mere hastily-built coachbuilt confection. Little was lost in the transition from prototype to production car."

The Duetto was a radical departure from the outgoing Giulietta Spider, the controversial sculptured flanks having been first heralded on the 6C 3000CM-based, Aldo Brovarone-penned Super Flow 1 show car of 1956. The overall style can be traced back to the Giulietta Spider Speciale Aerodinamica show car of 1962. If anything, the post-1970 Kamm tail version was better balanced stylistically. A late-run makeover by Pininfarina in 1990 – by which time the model was positively Neolithic – was brilliantly done."

As to the identity of the artiste responsible for the time-defying silhouette, therein lies a nettlesome issue.

The basic outline can be dated back to the Dino Berlinetta Speciale that was presented at the 1965 Paris Motor Show and styled by former Cisitalia man Aldo Brovarone. This one-off concept car undoubtedly influenced the Dino’s proportions. However, much of the detailing was down to Leonardo Fioravanti."

The Florida’s significance in Lancia lore cannot be overstated. It was an important way station on the road towards the Flaminia production car. It’s worth veneration for this fact alone but the Florida’s influence was such that it was still being cribbed the better part of two decades after the prototype broke cover at the 1955 Turin Salon. Admittedly, much of this ‘borrowing’ was down to Pininfarina which copied and pasted the outline ad infinitum."

Introduced in March 1971, its square-rigged outline was the work of the forever underrated Paolo Martin whose prior output at Pininfarina included the Modulo and Sigma show stoppers. Sadly, it wasn’t a commercial success, all things being relative, with 4294 being made to 1977."

          "First shown in prototype form at the 1971 Turin Motor Show, the original Berlinetta Boxer eschewed contemporary styling gimmicks, instead drawing inspiration from the earlier 512 Modulo and 512S Berlinette Speciale show cars. Penned by the super-talented Leonardo Fioravanti, it was perhaps less dramatic than the Lamborghini Countach launched that same year. It was, however, a more cohesive silhouette; one that escaped the plastic addenda that afflicted its rival in future years. It remains a classic old-school supercar and easily among the prettiest. In 1976, the 365 morphed into the 512BB which resulted in a hike in displacement, but with few stylistic changes."

          "Alfa Romeo rarely enjoyed international success producing large saloon cars. The 164 was the exception. Styled by Enrico Fumia, its wedge-shaped profile was among the most striking in its class which unquestionably boosted sales. It also influenced an entire generation of Alfas starting with the 33 facelift and the 155 mid-size saloon. Pininfarina wasn’t beyond cutting and pasting its designs, either, and much of the basic outline was ‘borrowed’ for the Peugeot 405 and 605 models. The addition of Zender styling skirts and other trinkets down the line didn’t detract from the 164’s styling, but they weren’t strictly necessary either."

          "Ushering in an era in which Pininfarina and Ferrari set about pushing envelopes and breaking moulds, the arrival of the Enzo at the 2002 Paris Motor Show was met with a sense of dumbstruck awe. Here, purity of line clearly took a backseat to packaging and aerodynamic requirement. Borrowing heavily from Formula 1 experience, the most obvious grand prix-inspired feature was the raised nose, flanked by a pair of radiators ahead of each front wheel. Hot air was directed through ducts to the outer body so as to prevent under-body airflow from upsetting the car’s balance."
