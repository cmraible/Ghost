<p>If you're in the market for a clean classic Chevy, <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851892-1966-Chevrolet-Impala">this 1966 Impala</a> will interest you. The Marina Blue Exterior and the black vinyl interior are said to be in near perfect condition, the mechanics fresh, and many parts original. If what the ad does say is true, then some lucky bidder is about to <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851892-1966-Chevrolet-Impala">get a real dream car.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851892-1966-Chevrolet-Impala">This classic Chevy</a> has been the recipient of a very mild restoration with a focus on mechanical parts. Under the hood is a mild built 406-cid engine with a Performer intake and an Edelbrock 750 CFM carburetor. A new HEI Distributor provides plenty of spark and a set of shorty headers with a 2.5-inch exhaust system incorporating glasspack mufflers gives the car a great tone.</p>
<p>A 700R4 4-speed automatic transmission backs the Small Block Chevy engine - this upgrade offers the car a much needed overdrive gear that adds to its driveability at highway speeds. A recently balanced and painted driveshaft feeds into a freshly rebuilt 12 bolt rear end featuring a very fitting 3.73:1 gear ratio and a new Auburn Posi-carrier. <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851892-1966-Chevrolet-Impala">The car</a> is riding on a set of 15-inch rally wheels with BFGoodrich Radial TA Tires and has a matching spare in the trunk.</p>
<p>Of the many original mechanical parts are a factory power steering system, factory fan shroud, flex fan, and water pump. The factory brakes have been upgraded with a dual master cylinder and a brand new Cold Case aluminum radiator has been installed. The suspension has also been improved upon with a new set of KYB gas adjustable shocks.</p>
<p><a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851892-1966-Chevrolet-Impala">According to the ad</a>, the only flaws in the interior are a few puckers in the headliner and a lack of factory A/C. The front seats have been reupholstered to match what appears to be the original rear seat and all of the door panels look very nice. The carpet has also been replaced recently too. The original steering wheel and gauges are in place and the dash has been fitted with a 4 speaker stereo. This may be a good opportunity for some Impala enthusiast to <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851892-1966-Chevrolet-Impala">pick up a nice 1966 Impala</a> that could be used as a daily driver as is or it may even make for the perfect jumping off point for a restomod.</p>
