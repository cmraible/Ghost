          "Just looking at the overall condition of this car, it isn't hard to see why this 1969 Chevrolet Corvette L71 earned the NCRS Top Flight award in 2014. Following an extensive frame-off restoration back in 2013, the Corvette retains its original style with a Fathom Green paint job over a saddle leather interior. As cool as the '69 'Vette looked, this particular car looks even better thanks to its rare N14 option that added on the factory side exhaust. The cool part about this option is that it was only added to about 4,300 of the almost 39,000 Corvettes built that year, according to the listing."

This optional engine is rated at 435 horsepower, and it is the car's original, numbers-matching engine. Power is sent to the rear tires through a Muncie four-speed manual transmission and positraction rear end. It'll be hard to find a C3 Corvette that is much nicer or more original than this one, so don't miss your chance to bid on this incredible sports car."
