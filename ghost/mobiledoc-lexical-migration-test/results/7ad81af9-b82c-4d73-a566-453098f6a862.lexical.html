<hr>
<p>We've got a bit of a thing for <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">late C3 Corvettes</a>. The 1980-1982 models may have been down on power, but they've got some of the best-looking bodies ever, in our opinion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This final-year C3</a> is a remarkably well-kept car, and it has a seriously cool option that makes it a once-in-a-lifetime find. We really wish we could bring it home, but maybe one of our lucky readers will have the pleasure.</p>
<p>This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/entries-to-win-two-corvettes/">Corvette</a> is equipped with RPO V54, the <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Roof Panel Carrier</a>. Unlike the later C4 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ends-today-your-last-chance-to-own/">Corvettes</a>, the C3 did not have a space inside the car to store the removable roof panels.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/v542.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1620" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/v542.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/v542.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/v542.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/v542.jpg 1620w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>The Roof Panel Carrier was the solution. Just under 2,000 1982 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/three-corvette-giveaways/">Corvettes</a> were ordered with <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this option</a>, which mounted them on the rear deck, like a luggage rack or a ski carrier. </p>
<p>These days, most folks have removed them and filled the holes. Seeing an intact Roof Panel Carrier is certainly a rarity. That makes <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this particular 1982 Corvette</a> even more rare – and more practical!</p>

<p>It's not as if this car needs any help. It's an incredibly well-preserved, low-mileage car, in a <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">desirable color combo</a> – red on red. The odometer shows just 20,585 miles, and given the overall condition of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1963-split-window-corvette/">Corvette</a>, we're inclined to believe that's original.</p>
<p>If you'd like to add this unique <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-1966-corvette/">Corvette</a> to your collection, It's being sold by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-one-of-the-lost-corvettes/">Corvette</a> specialists <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/69/1982-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike Midwest</a>, located in Burr Ridge, Illinois. For just under $25,000, it's an affordable classic, and an excellent example of the final evolution of the C3 Corvette.</p>
