At release, the max level is 60 so there is a chance it may increase at a later date. In my personal experience, after completing all of the daily missions in my first play session, I managed to get to level three, making the overall grinding experience feel like an absolute chore at higher levels. If unlocking collectable cosmetics is important to you, then the lack of content at launch is going to get old really quick and if you’re someone like me who doesn’t really care for collectable cosmetics, then you’ll only have about 20 minutes worth of gameplay here if you really stretch it out."

          " one map is pretty simple but competently designed, having a big open area in the middle where all the game’s chaos ends up gravitating towards and some side areas full of nooks and crannies to juke around your opponents attempting to attack you. There are also some hidden areas that connect one side of the map to the other just in case you’d rather avoid the chaos that is the centre of the map. I say hidden but they aren’t really, they’re just roads that don’t show up on the minimap but that being said, sometimes power-ups (which show up on the minimap) spawn in those hidden roads so making them hidden is kind of useless."

Every inch of the game is plastered with posters and advertisements that scream “BUY, SELL, CONSUME” at you while in the backstreets and various corners of the map, you’ll find anti-consumerist graffiti. Annoyingly, I can’t tell if the choice to add a live service gameplay model to the game is to keep with the theme of a capitalist dystopia or if it’s done genuinely and is just a tragically ironic development choice and I’m scared that if I point that out, I’m going to lose my indie gamer cred."
