Sadly, many believed it was true and turned to import brands for their on-road thrills. The reality was American muscle was anything but six feet under and this 1987 Buick Grand National Turbo proves it. Exceptionally preserved with just 10,215 miles on the clock, you can feel what a true 80s American performance car was like."

That means the paint is shiny from nose to tail, each body panel is free from damage, only factory gauges and controls are present, and even the OE floormats are not only accounted for, they’re wrapped in plastic. You also get to rock out to the original AM/FM casette stereo, maybe listening to Twisted Sister or Oingo Boingo, while also using cruise control."

Both are touted as being in excellent condition, so expect this car to pull strong and gap lesser cars with ease. The seller also says the dealer-installed undercoating in perfect condition is still present, a nice upsell the original owner opted for to keep his precious ride rust-free."
