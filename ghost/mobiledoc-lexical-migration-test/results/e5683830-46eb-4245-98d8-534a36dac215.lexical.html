<p>Non-UK readers will have been spared this, but our media have been locked into a weeks-long obsession with the disappearance of a middle-aged woman. Her body was recently found exactly where the police expected it to be: in a local river. </p>
<p>Quite why specific people get this level of coverage when they go missing and others are all but ignored still puzzles me. For example, over five years ago, a former <em>Estates Gazette</em> colleague went missing — and <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/mystery-missing-west-norwood-dad-23197420">has never been found</a>. His disappearance has never troubled the national media, although it did make it into the relevant locals, despite the fact that his wife is a fairly <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rachel-De-Thample/e/B005EMAL3K%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share">well-known cookery writer</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Nicola_Bulley">Nicola Bulley</a> was one of those whose disappearance gripped both the media and the public. After her body was found, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-64707699">family issued a statement</a> which did not hold back in its criticism of the media for their coverage of Nicola's disappearance. </p>
<blockquote>It saddens us to think that one day we will have to explain to them that the press and members of the public accused their dad of wrongdoing, misquoted and vilified friends and family. This is absolutely appalling, they have to be held accountable; this cannot happen to another family.</blockquote>
<p>There's been some worthwhile looks at what went wrong and why, and they <em>should</em> be a trigger for us to try and learn something from this. Who knows if they will, though…</p>

<h2 id="the-ai-copyright-battle">The AI copyright battle</h2>
<p>Over in the states, Kris Kashtanova, whom I taught during their undergraduate degree at City, has been fighting to defend their copyright on a graphic novel they created using AI. To be clear, they wrote the script, laid out the pages, added the speech and narrative bubbles — and created the prompts used in Midjourney to generate the images. </p>
<p>The US Copyright office has decided that they have copyright in the writing of the book, and in the arrangement of the images on the page, but not on the individual images themselves. </p>
<p>And so what will be a burgeoning field of AI copyright law starts to develop…</p>

<p>I keep saying that AI is not ready for use in search just yet. Ryan Broderick is prepared to go one step further and say that it <em>never</em> will be any good for that, and he makes an intriguing case: </p>
<blockquote>My hunch is that AI is just not good for search and actually never will be. And to be honest, I’m a little confused as to why we think it would be. It’s like giving a guy that’s high on acid access to the biggest library in the world.</blockquote>
<p>I'm still not completely convinced. The AI of two years' time might be much better at this. Anywhere machine learning gets applied, the quality tends to rise dramatically as it gets used more. So, we'll see. </p>

<h2 id="why-the-algorithm-loves-nonsense">Why the algorithm loves nonsense</h2>
<p>If you've been spending any time on TikTok or Reels on Facebook or Instagram, you'll have come across the phenomenon of inexplicably pointless videos. You may even have watched them multiple times, trying to figure out what the hell is going on. And that, in itself, is the point. And, as Freddie deBoer argues, this is the inevitable result of our current media landscape:</p>
<blockquote>I’m talking about videos in which the purpose is to drive “engagement” through a given clip’s lack of sense and meaning and nothing else. They’ve taken the monetization of attention to a certain logical endpoint: their creators understand that there are few things people like less than the feeling of being confused, and that most of us will seek help to understand something we can’t figure out on our own. Seeking that help by sharing or commenting gooses the algorithm.</blockquote>
