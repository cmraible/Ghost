<p><a href="https://www.tapkat.org/fair-lane-home-of-clara-and-henry-ford/69Me49?promo=MOTDEC">RTR built</a> this Ford Bronco out of the inspiration and purpose for Fair Lane: Hom of Clara and Henry Ford. They built the Bronco as Henry Ford would have wanted it with a black-on-black appearance, and Vaughn Gittin, Jr. poured himself into designing this with his expertise as an off-road racing champion. It throws back to the the original Vagabonds, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and their entourage, and is begging you to take it on an adventure.</p>
