<p>Welcome to part 3 of our walkthrough of the Pikuniku Adventure Mode! Whilst this game is quite linear, there are still some moments and puzzles that may leave you scratching your head. As the title suggests, we’ll be fighting a robot and restoring power to the hideout.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we left off from part 2, we had just defeated the robot boss in the forest and we were heading out of the secret base. As you’re about to leave, one of the rebels will stop you and give you the Water Hat.</p>

<p>This one isn’t really a boss fight per se, it’s more of a boss run away from (not quite as catchy). All you need to do is run from start to finish and not get caught by the big robot. There are a few hints we can give, like taking advantage of doors that lead more level-grounded routes…</p>

<p>Jumping over pits (that’s an obvious one) and holding A to turn into a bean in order to go faster when you’re on flat surfaces.</p>
<p>When you make it to the end and hide in the little crevice, the rebels will fire the laser on the robot and that’s the end of that.</p>
<p>Now you’ll be back in the hideout, celebrating. After a bit of dialogue, you’ll need to turn the power back on.</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Turn the power back on</h3>
