That got a lot of ‘Vette enthusiasts worked up and ruffled the feathers of many who own far more expensive, exotic vehicles. But if you know anything about Koenigsegg, that’s just par for the course."

          "Koenigsegg was quoted as saying the C8 Corvette is a good “gang for the buck” vehicle. The Corvette always has been a tremendous value, with many arguing the mid-engine platform switch has only increased that equation. This was said during Monterey Car Week where many automotive industry executives gathered to watch the auctions and rub shoulders with many well-heeled collectors."

They’re truly exclusive machines meant only for a close circle of customers, so close that the owner of the company apparently knows each and every one of them. We don’t imagine GM executives know everyone driving a C8 Corvette."

Hey, the man is a superlative competitor and takes great pride in his work. Considering how impressive his hypercars are, we think he has plenty of room to talk trash."
