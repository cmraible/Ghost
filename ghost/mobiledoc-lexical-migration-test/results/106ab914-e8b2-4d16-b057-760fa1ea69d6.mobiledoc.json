Have RX-4s suddenly become that desirable? After all, the dealer asking for this amount, Oldtimer Australia, might not get that much for the classic Mazda."

Considering it only has 6,397 km on the clock, that explains why. So the dealer might be right in proclaiming this ride belongs in a museum because it has been exceptionally preserved over the decades."

We wonder if it will stay Down Under or if some Mazda aficionado in another country will snatch it up, considering themselves lucky for paying into the six digits to own such an example. To everyone else that seems like insanity, yet here we are."
