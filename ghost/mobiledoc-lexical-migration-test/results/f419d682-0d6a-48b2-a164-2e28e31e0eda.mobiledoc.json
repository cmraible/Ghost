The most notable additions are the satin black accents on the hood and taillight lettering as well as the 20-inch \"Gold School\" wheels. Special 50th anniversary headlights add a nice little Easter egg to the design, while the \"Challenger 50\" logo is added to the grille, rear spoiler and instrument panel. The Commemorative Edition is offered in the following colors: Granite, Indigo Blue, Octane Red, Pitch Black, Triple Nickel, White Knuckle and the all-new Smoke Show hue, which is also available on the 2020 Dodge Charger."

There's also a modern theme to the interior, though, with Alcantara on the seats and door panels and real carbon fiber on the dash."
