A few laters chassis 6273 returned back to the United States where it was displayed at Concorso Italiano in Monterey, California in 2003 and 2007. This Islero was refurbished yet again, including a repaint in Grigio Agate (grey), by a dealership selling the car. The current owner bought the car in 2015, and again the car was refurbished. During this time it received a reupholstered Tobacco leather interior, and the numbers-matching 3.9-liter DOHC V12 engine was pulled out to be cosmetically and mechanically refreshed. To add to the fun factor of this Islero, it is shifted via a five-speed manual transmission. "
