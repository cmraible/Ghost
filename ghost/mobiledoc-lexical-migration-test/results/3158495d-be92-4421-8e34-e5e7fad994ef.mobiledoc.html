<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>Between SCOTUS, Congress probably not passing a climate bill, and the general state of the world, my friends and I (including lots of organizers) have been fantasizing more and more about going off the grid. From a political perspective, I know it‚Äôs escapist and maybe even irresponsible. But with everything going to shit, I also want to build the best life possible with people I care about. Is there some happy medium here?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Unsure Utopian</p>
<p><strong>Dear Unsure Utopian,</strong></p>
<p>There is no correlation between the amount of suffering you personally experience and your contribution to collective liberation. Wanting to seek out joy and contentment ‚Äî and even to work a bit less ‚Äî isn‚Äôt anathema to solidarity.</p>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm old, necessarily (I‚Äôm 30), but I‚Äôve seen plenty of comrades burn the candle at both ends for years only to step away from movement work almost entirely. In the climate world, at least, there also just aren‚Äôt all that many people above the age of 40 to look to for tips on how to make the work of staving off apocalypse more sustainable over the long haul.</p>
<p>Especially in the U.S., ‚Äúmovement work‚Äù is often, well, work ‚Äî i.e., your job. And most jobs are bad. Union drives at progressive nonprofits have been a means of making those jobs (and the valuable work involved therein) more decent. The fact is that someone who shares your politics can still be your boss; people working toward a greater good still need paid vacation. Even movement work outside of nonprofits ‚Äî which is to say, quite a lot of it! ‚Äî still happens in a society where productivity is valued above all else, and not being visibly miserable/overworked is conflated with not doing enough.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt a case for trying to cultivate some ideal work-life balance: organizing projects can be all-consuming, especially in the heat of a campaign. Sleepless nights and greasy take-out all come with the territory. But the temptation to drop out and build a beautiful community after several such marathons is a real one. If the state isn‚Äôt going to provide paid family leave or free daycare or guarantee a dignified quality of life to the elderly, then communal living also makes a certain amount of objective sense.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an obvious appeal for people at other stages of life, too. Until last December, I‚Äôd lived semi-communally since college, sharing food, chores, politics, party-hosting duties ‚Äî and even a lawsuit against our landlord with roommates ‚Äî in a tiny five-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. Humans are social creatures, after all, and tend to crave forms of community that capitalism has made difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Throughout history, unions and left parties have been more than an organ for campaigns and policy. They have also furnished social lives and material well-being for their members, animated by a vision for a better world. As those institutions have been destroyed by red-baiting and decades of attacks on organized labor, that social, world-building aspect of the left has fallen away, too.</p>
<p>There are practical realities ($$$) that can make trying to rebuild aspects of those communities in isolated places more appealing. As you say, though, there‚Äôs good reason to feel complicated about ‚Äúgoing off the grid.‚Äù I‚Äôm personally skeptical of the idea that little utopias are only possible if you <em>withdraw</em> from society and its people. And while there seems to be a decent case for cultivating some practical skills ‚Äî growing food, carpentry, electrical work, etc. ‚Äî I‚Äôm not sold on the idea that society will experience collapse dramatic enough within our lifetimes to make using them on some secluded compound a necessity.</p>

<p>There also isn‚Äôt some morally justified point at which to resign to the climate crisis being too far gone, especially if you are living in the belly of the beast ‚Äî the United States, the world‚Äôs largest source of historical emissions and biggest oil and gas producer. Every tenth of a degree of warming translates into tens of thousands of lives lost, many of which will be beyond U.S. borders.</p>
<p>The line here, in my view, is between doing what‚Äôs necessary to maintain your own work and well-being and orienting your political project around your own social circle, stopping at how to make people you know personally more healthy and happy, rather than putting a healthier, happier world in reach for the many.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been feeling pretty helpless since the Supreme Court overturned<em> Roe v. Wade</em>. Where could I throw some time or money to make a difference (or at least feel like I am)?</p>
<p>Distressingly,</p>
<p>An Anxious Abortion Defender</p><!--members-only-->
<p><strong>Dear Anxious Abortion Defender,</strong></p>
<p>You may, understandably, be a bit fed up with hearing that the best way to fight back against the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is to ‚Äúvote harder‚Äù for a party that didn‚Äôt protect it in the first place, or to be told to donate to that same party within minutes of the decision. Luckily, there are plenty of alternatives!</p>

<p>Smaller groups lack the well-staffed fundraising teams that larger and higher-profile groups like Planned Parenthood have and are therefore more strapped for cash. Nearly <a href="https://jezebel.com/independent-abortion-clinics-are-the-backbone-of-reprod-1848067419">60 percent</a> of abortions are performed by independent clinics that lack resources; more than a third of them have closed since 2015. You can donate to a specific clinic via a <a href="https://abortioncarenetwork.org/abortion-care-providers/">list</a> compiled by the Abortion Care Network. Abolitionist author and organizer Mariame Kaba is also currently holding a <a href="http://bonfire.com/not-one-second-of-peace/">fundraiser</a> for the West Alabama Women‚Äôs Center, a reproductive health and abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa.</p>
<p>Abortion funds and other practical support can help people deal with the expense and logistics of getting an abortion, including travel, lodging and and the cost of abortion itself. The procedure alone can cost at least $500 in the first trimester, and the price increases as pregnancies progress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iwrising.org/abortion-fund">Indigenous Women Rising</a>‚Äôs Abortion Fund helps cover these costs for Indigenous people who need abortions throughout the U.S. and Canada, while many other such funds work regionally and locally. Apiary offers a <a href="https://apiaryps.org/pso-list">state-by-state</a> guide to help locate organizations to support in your area, which you can then go donate to directly. Just keep in mind that, as their site notes, several such groups in states with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trigger-laws-roe-v-wade-1346797/">trigger bans</a> or other anti-abortion statutes in place have temporarily halted operations to assess their legal standing.</p>
<p>The National Network of Abortion Funds offers a ‚Äú<a href="https://abortionfunds.org/funds/#list">Find Your Fund</a>‚Äù guide to independent clinics and practical support organizations. In 2020, their member organizations were only able to meet just over half the requests for support they received ‚Äî and demand is likely to grow considerably in the months to come as they figure out what abortion after <em>Roe v. Wade</em> might look like.</p>
<p>Demand is also likely to swell in states where abortion rights aren‚Äôt in immediate danger, as people travel there to seek out the procedure. The <a href="https://abortionfunds.org/funds/#list">Find Your Fund</a> site also offers an option to <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/fundabortionnow">split your gift</a> evenly among 93 funds throughout the country, including the Kentucky Health Justice Network and the Alabama Cohosh Collaborative, or choose which fund you‚Äôd like to support. As is generally the case, becoming a sustaining donor ‚Äî giving smaller amounts each month ‚Äî offers groups a reliable income stream that they can plan around. Some people also donate a certain percentage of their monthly or annual income, a practice known as tithing.</p>
<p>If you have free time to donate, groups like the <a href="http://www.havencoalition.org/volunteer-information.html">Haven Coalition</a> connect volunteers with people coming to the state for abortion care, in order to accompany them to and from clinics, provide dinner and a warm bed, or offer up a couch or blow-up mattress to sleep on. Practical support organizations around the country also often coordinate volunteers to provide similar types of support, including to serve as escorts. <a href="https://linktr.ee/nycforabortion">NYC for Abortion Rights</a> does regular <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/planned-parenthood-asked-these-pro-choice-activists-not-to-rally-outside-their-clinic-heres-why-they-did-anyway/">clinic defense work</a>, countering already rampant protests and violence against patients and providers that has ticked up in recent years.</p>
<p>You might also consider getting involved in the Democratic Socialist of America‚Äôs (DSA) <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/working-groups/feminism/">Socialist Feminist Working Group</a>, which can be an entry point to getting involved in organizing and analysis around reproductive justice.</p>
<p>So far, just four states and the District of Columbia have codified <em>Roe v. Wade</em> into law. In New York, where I live, that only happened after progressives beat out a group of Democrats who caucused with Republicans. If you live in a blue state, electing <em>better </em>Democratic state lawmakers who actually support reproductive rights ‚Äî via groups like DSA or the Working Families Party, which run door-knocking and phone bank campaigns ‚Äî can help tip the balance.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Left Wondering</p>
