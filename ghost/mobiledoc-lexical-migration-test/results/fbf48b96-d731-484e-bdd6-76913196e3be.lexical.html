<p>It's hard to miss this Bronco with its bright red paint, which is complemented by the white hardtop, black fender extensions and beautiful, flawless chrome. A 3.5-inch suspension lift provides plenty of clearance for the massive 32x11.50 Falken tires and delivers a killer off-road stance. This Bronco has been customized to make the factory doors removable, and a custom roll cage ensures plenty of safety for occupants.</p>
<p>To make sure this rig is ready for any adventure, the seats have been upholstered in fast-drying neoprene and the flooring is rugged vinyl. With the doors and top on, this truck has a secure interior, but when riding around with everything off, a locking center console helps keep belongings safe. Even the aftermarket Bluetooth-capable audio system can remain hidden with a false cover that mimics an old AM radio.</p>
<p>Under the hood of this jacked-up Bronco is a 302 CID V8 that has been upgraded with an Edelbrock aluminum intake and a 650cfm carb with an electric choke. The three-speed automatic transmission retains its factory column-mounted shifter as does the floor-mounted transfer case shifter. Power steering and front disc brakes (rear drum) makes this Bronco ready for the street or trail.</p>
