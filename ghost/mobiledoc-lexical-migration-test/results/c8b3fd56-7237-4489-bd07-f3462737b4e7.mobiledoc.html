<p>Known by many as the cutest van on the planet, the Type 2 (as it was officially known) took the market by storm and enjoys the accolade of the longest running production vehicle in history. From 1949 all the way to 2013, some 64 years, the VW remained largely unchanged â€“ akin to the original Mini and Land Rover Defender.</p>
<p>Originally used to ferry parts around the Wolfsburg factory with a rather ropey looking Beetle (Type 1) chassis (before finally being signed off for production), the Bus had been offered in 90 different configurations in the first five years alone, and went on to enjoy a production run of over 5 million units.</p>

<p>Despite these biblical numbers, values for all models have broken through the atmosphere over the years, with the earliest examples commanding premiums that have to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p>The example offered here by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Vintage+Car+Collector">Vintage Car Collector</a> may not be a Split Window variant, but it certainly is the sought after Bay model, being a late example from 1978 with a rather epic 1970s paint job to boot.</p>

<p>Most vehicles of this era are unlikely to wield this color combination with grace, yet somehow <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/166402/1978-volkswagen-bus-vanagon">this</a> little Bus looks epic with its brown body and orange pinstripe. A period roof rack is the icing on the proverbial cake, and gives the VW a stance most fail to achieve thanks to such original features. All you need is an avocado bathroom to match and you are set!</p>
<p>The Bus looks to be in excellent condition, with just 61,000 miles on the odometer along with some recent service work including a rebuilt clutch, injectors and brakes. New tires complete the package in what looks to be a Bus ready for a 'road to nowhere'.</p>
<p>Tan vinyl interior compliments the exterior, with rubber matting that looks in exemplary condition. Further detailed shots of the floors and door shuts show a vehicle that has clearly been looked after, with absolutely zero signs of rot from any angle.</p>
