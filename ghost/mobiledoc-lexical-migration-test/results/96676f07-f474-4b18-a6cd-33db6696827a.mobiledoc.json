As he pointed out, using this particular Jeep as a starting point meant his team didn't have to do a full frame-off restoration, which helped reduce build costs. Visually, this Grand Wagoneer looks bone stock inside and out right down to the wood grain and factory wheels, but the coolest part of this build is that it's painted in the Bright Red (color code 4B), which is a perfect complement to the monster engine stuffed under the hood."
