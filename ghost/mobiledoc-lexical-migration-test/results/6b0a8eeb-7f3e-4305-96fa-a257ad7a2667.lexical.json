It’s a worthwhile thing to consider when you see videos like this one of a 1924 Ford Model T fired up after it has sat unused for years. Will our technologically-advanced rides age nearly as gracefully as this classic car? Or will all the plastic crumble and split apart, rendering many of the components unusable? While the engines aren’t made of composites, they do rely on computers to run, but will they operate correctly a century from now? The simplicity in design of a Model T seems to come with some definite advantages as well as the obvious drawbacks.",
