It also has all-wheel drive, which can be a huge advantage when launching. However, the Hoonicorn is no drag racer."

While it sounds like it’s outgunned by the Hoonicorn, the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission helps it rocket from 0-62 in 2.8 seconds and 0-124 in 6.8 seconds. In other words, this hypercar should absolutely destroy just about anything in the quarter mile, which McLaren claims is completed by the Senna in 10 seconds flat."
