          " in 1963, and unlike the kit cars and replicas that are out there, Superformance is licensed by GM to built these Grand Sports, and that includes access to the car's original tooling. Zora Arkus-Duntov was the mastermind behind the Corvette Grand Sport, and it was Chevrolet's answer to AC Cobra using anything possible to reduce weight and increase power. Doug Campbell of Superformance gives a little more insight about what made the Grand Sport so special including the fact that the car was shrunk down to 7/8ths scale and given thinner-than-stock body panels in order to shave weight without looking obvious."

With a Lingenfelter tuning, the car you're looking at lays down a monster 750 horsepower, which is even more incredible considering the Corvette weighs in at around 2,900 pounds. "

You can tell just how much pull this car has to it as both men are thrust back into their seats when the driver hits the gas. While the Grand Sport was designed for racing, Superformance factors some touring capabilities into their builds including comfortable seats, power steering with a tilt column, air conditioning and four-wheel disc brakes."
