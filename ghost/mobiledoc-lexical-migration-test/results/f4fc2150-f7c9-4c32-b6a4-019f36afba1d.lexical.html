Whether you like these cars, many regard the vehicles as a classier version of their third-generation Camaro counterparts.

<p>First of all, you have to understand what condition this iconic American sports car was in when they found it. Having been listed for sale online, this car features quite a bit of dust and debris covering the exterior. Even the wheels were too tight for the new owner to remove, so he got his buddies to help him with a sledgehammer. Originally the plan was to offer a detailing to the former owner, but the team purchased the car for a pricey $4,500. This may seem insane, considering they didn't even know if the car would start, but eventually, the motivation for the purchase became clear.</p>
<p>First up on the shop's to-do list was a prewash which got all of the years of debris unstuck so the polishing wouldn't cause scouring in the paint. Even the intake of this car was pretty disgusting as a nest of some sort had lodged itself in their pretty tight. The suspension and braking systems also got a thorough cleaning, and the polishing was set to begin. One of this car's significant problems was its fragile paint which warranted a one-step polish. When all was said and done, the car eventually started and is now ready for a new life with its fresh-looking paint and interior/exterior detailing work.</p>
