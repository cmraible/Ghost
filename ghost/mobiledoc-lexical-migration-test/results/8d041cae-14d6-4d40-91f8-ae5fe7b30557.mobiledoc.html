<p>This week, Sirota and Tom Frank discuss the rise and fall of the Lincoln Project, and how the Republican group is merely the latest iteration of “political entrepreneurs” turning democracy into a business opportunity. They also discuss the larger context of the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and how it was the latest expression of conservative grievance politics that goes back decades and intensified during the Tea Party era. Finally, they discuss Democrats’ lack of urgency in fulfilling their promises to help the country during the current economic crisis.</p>
