<p>It seems like these days <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">car thefts are rampant</a>, and thereâ€™s plenty of data to back that up plus <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">warn everyone that itâ€™s going to get even worse</a>. Sadly, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-steals-14-cars/">crime wave</a> has allegedly struck Mike Harmon Racing, which took to Twitter to let everyone know A Ford F-350 dually truck, 32-foot racing trailer, and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-camaro-runs-out-of-road-in-australia/">Chevy Camaro</a> stock car No. 47 were all stolen in the early morning hours of August 16. The truck, trailer, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/happy-25th-birthday-nascar-trucks/">NASCAR</a> racer were all parked in Kingsland, Georgia which is in the southeast portion of the state.</p>

<p>Surveillance cameras captured the truck pulling the trailer south on Interstate 95 toward Florida on the morning of August 16. Anyone living in Florida should be watching out for these vehicles, although thereâ€™s a strong likelihood theyâ€™ve been chopped or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/40-stolen-cars-canada/">are on a boat</a> out of the country by now. Still, you never know, so please share this information to spread it around and hopefully a recovery is made soon.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t follow NASCAR, Mike Harmon racing fields the No. 47 and No. 74 Chevrolets in the Xfinity Series. The team often does pro-police activities and has a #StandForTheFlag hashtag on both cars. Itâ€™s unclear if <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wildest-stolen-car-stories/">the theft</a> has anything to do with these controversial stances.</p>
