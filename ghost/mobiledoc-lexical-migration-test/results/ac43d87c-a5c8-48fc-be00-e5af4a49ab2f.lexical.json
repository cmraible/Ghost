With how aggressive The Red Dragon has been toward the West lately, including going hard against Australian imports like wine, being overly dependent on the communist dictatorship seems incredibly unwise.

Now, he said the industry won’t “like” it “in a few years.” But let’s face it, the way those minerals are mined right now often involves ecological devastation and child labor with horrific health consequences. To turn a blind eye to that is borderline criminal. Too often, Western countries of late have played the game of exporting the “yucky” parts of industry to nations in the East so they can pretend they’ve “gone green” and cleaned up their act entirely. That’s led to all kinds of unpleasant realities, like Europe becoming all too dependent on Russia for oil. Imagine if a similar uncomfortable reality about relying on China for lithium-ion batteries suddenly came in sharp focus for industry leaders? Right now it’s on their peripheral vision, but it’s entirely possible that notion will shift to sharp focus soon enough.",
