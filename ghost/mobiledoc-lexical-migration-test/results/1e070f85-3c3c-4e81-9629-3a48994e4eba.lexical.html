<p>With countries, states, provinces, cities, etc. shutting down and many people voluntarily staying away from others during the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-henry-ford-shuts-down-for-coronavirus-outbreak/">coronavirus outbreak</a>, keeping yourself sane is a challenge. Fortunately, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a> fans have quite a few options. If you’re not into the X-Box races being broadcast online but instead want to see some cool cars while learning about automotive history, you’re in luck. Quite a few excellent <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/features/359180/car-museums-young-visitors/">auto museums</a> offer online tours of one form or another, allowing you to “get out of the house” without leaving your couch.</p>
<p>To check out all the museums on this list would take a long time, so that will help chew through those hours upon hours you have to burn.</p>
<p><strong>National Corvette Museum</strong></p>

<p>One of the holdouts when other museums were closing down, the National Corvette Museum <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-museum/">finally shut down after March 18</a>. Just because you can’t go to Bowling Green to get your <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Chevrolet?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImNvcnZldHRlIl19">Chevy Corvette</a> fix doesn’t mean you’re doomed. Thanks to the wonders of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.0043256,-86.375041,2a,75y,143.81h,82.37t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBWl9OsTsGLy9MFzr-YswAA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DBWl9OsTsGLy9MFzr-YswAA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D211.92207%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en">Google Street View</a> you can see why so many flock to this facility, including the infamous sinkhole display.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini Museum</strong></p>
<p>Several years ago <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a> made waves by opening up its famous museum to the public through Google Street View, allowing you to virtually tour it <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@44.6591361,11.1257742,3a,90y,1.53h,77.14t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0YqKxyWH1sQAAAQIuAy4iw!2e0!7i9692!8i4846?hl=en">here</a>. “Walking” among all those geometrically-wild historic cars is fun, but if you’re interested in a video tour, there’s an unofficial one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78ki9-ExWkw&feature=emb_logo">available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Porsche Museum</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/porsche_museum_2019_porsche_ag.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Tour Some Virtual Auto Museums " loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Regarded as one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/must-see-car-museuma/">best car museums</a> in the world, the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche">Porsche</a> Museum bristles with amazing vehicles, displays, and architecture. That includes those ultra-<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/15-more-famous-film-vehicles/">famous cars</a> like the Porsche 917 Pink Pig and even a wall that’s a giant touchscreen. You can get a feel for what it’s all about by watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6SibUdujBk&feature=emb_logo">YouTube video of Shmee150 touring the facilities</a> and talking about the cars. If he annoys you, just hit mute and try not to look at him, because The Porsche Museum doesn’t have a digital tour option online, so this is as close as it gets.</p>
<p><strong>Mazda Museum</strong></p>
<p>This outbreak is opening up all kinds of doors that are normally closed, including the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mazda">Mazda</a> Museum. Normally you could only see inside with a reservation. On top of that, the whole thing has been shut down since December for renovations and won’t open against until June. But you can tour portions of the place online through Google Street View by visiting <a href="https://www.mazda.com/en/about/museum/guide/">here</a>. Let’s hope the opening date of the entire remodeled museum isn’t pushed out further, but this will tide us over until then.</p>
<p><strong>The Petersen Automotive Museum</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/new-petersen-museum-exterior.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Tour Some Virtual Auto Museums " loading="lazy"></figure>

<p><strong>Toyota Museum</strong></p>
<p>One of the most surprising things about the Toyota Automobile Museum is that it not only features oodles of historic <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Toyota">Toyotas</a> but also <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Chevrolet">Chevrolets</a>, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benzs</a>, Porsches, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Nissan">Nissans</a>, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Volkswagen">Volkswagens</a>, and more. Its’ a celebration of the history of the automobile. Unfortunately, you can’t drive the cars on the museum’s incredible track, but you can take a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1727938,137.0579666,2a,75y,10.82h,75.09t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdEYLbX94isbZY6F24JUfgA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">Google Street View tour</a> of the extensive facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Lane Motor Museum</strong></p>
<p>Located in Nashville, Tennessee, this automotive museum is a collection of the oddities of the car world.

<p>Just like pretty much everything these days, Mercedes-Benz’s museum is shut down at the moment. There is a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17896551259393661/">virtual guided tour on Instagram</a>, plus a virtual guided tour of the G-Class on the same platform. Also, there’s a tour of the museum at night on YouTube or you can just do the <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/classic/museum/exhibition/">virtual tour on the museum’s own website</a>. Considering this automaker has been around about as long as the automobile itself, this museum is a must-see.</p>
<p><strong>Mullin Automotive Museum</strong></p>
<p>A newer California-based automotive museum, Mullin is known for housing one of the largest collections of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Bugatti">Bugattis</a> in the world.

<p>Even more immersive is the fact <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ferrari">Ferrari</a> boasts two museums. The one if Maranello is more automotive-focused with plenty of mesmerizing cars, history of the company, and some of its motorsports trophies. However, the museum in Modena goes more into the life of Enzo and features some of the brand’s earliest cars. Google Street View has a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@44.652239,10.9366808,3a,75y,186.23h,92.73t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipO92x6fXMZRD_FHV9CFTepYjoa6IN8A8EPhWSki!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipO92x6fXMZRD_FHV9CFTepYjoa6IN8A8EPhWSki%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya133.84018-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352">virtual tour</a> of the Maranello museum.

<p><strong>Nissan Zama Heritage Collection</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a JDM fan then you might already know about Nissan’s extensive <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/389888/nissan-zama-heritage-collection">Zama Heritage Collection</a>, which contains both consumer vehicles like the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Nissan/Skyline?filter=eyJtb2RlbHMiOlsiU2t5bGluZSBHVC1SIiwiU2t5bGluZSBWIFNwZWMgaWkgTnVyIl19">Nissan Skyline</a> and <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Datsun/280Z">Datsun 280Z</a> as well as quite a few race cars.
