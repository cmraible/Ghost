Maybe the shutdowns made people wake up and realize things could be done differently, but almost nobody likes going into a dealership, wasting hours of their time while supposedly haggling for a better deal, only to go sign the paperwork with the finance guy to realize they have to haggle even more. It’s an exhausting process. But we can’t say whether doing everything online will help you get a better price or get hosed on your new Dodge since this is a new program and such. It’ll be interesting to see how things run and how much people take to this new way of car shopping through Dodge dealerships.",
