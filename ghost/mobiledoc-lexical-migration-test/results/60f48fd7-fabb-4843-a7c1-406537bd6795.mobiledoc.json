This engine is backed by a three-speed automatic transmission and Ford's renowned nine-inch rear end to ensure this muscle Mustang is ready for racing or cruising."

The inside of this Mustang is just as clean as the outside, and its use of two-tone accents on the seats and carpet makes it quite the looker! To make sure it's as fun to drive as it is to look at, this Mach 1 adds aftermarket items like Vintage Air and a vintage-style stereo head unit. Anywhere you look, this restored first-year Mach 1 is about as you get."
