<p>It's been around since the 1950s and it’s one of the world’s most famous sports cars. The Mercedes-Benz SL has stood the test of time and is rivalled in years only by Chevrolet's Corvette.</p>
<p>This SL, offered by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Pedigree+Motorcars">Pedigree Motorcars</a>, is the R107 model. The incarnation of SL whose life spanned a whopping 18 years in production and, to this day remains, the most popular generation of all time.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the world that had a wealth of engine and transmission choices over the years, Mercedes only allowed V8 engined models to venture to the States, such as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164659/1988-mercedes-benz-560sl">this</a> rather fine looking 560SL model.</p>
<p>For the North American market, the SL came almost fully loaded with only one transmission option throughout its life cycle. A quick peek at the options list for the final year of production reveals just three options; heated seats, and left and right seat electrically operated orthopaedic backrest.</p>

<p>The 560SL cost $61,130 when it rolled out of its Tennessee showroom in 1988, and it stayed with its original buyer until now, which is one incredible accolade. Despite the years gathering momentum, just 26,000 miles have been added to the odometer and it has evidently been cherished.</p>
<p>The 5.6 liter V8 may not be a powerhouse, but it certainly provides immeasurable amounts of thrust and torque. Rated at 227 horsepower and 279 pounds-feet of torque, it will happily fulfil all your cruising requirements.</p>
<p>Listed as completely original, the miles speak for themselves. With only regular maintenance carried out this example claims to be totally original in every discernable way, and we wouldn’t contest that.</p>
<p>Along with an oil service, gearbox service and a fresh set of tires, extensive maintenance has been carried out due to the lack of use, to ensure the new owner can be happy either putting it in a collection of adding some much-needed miles to the odometer; we know which we’d opt for.</p>
