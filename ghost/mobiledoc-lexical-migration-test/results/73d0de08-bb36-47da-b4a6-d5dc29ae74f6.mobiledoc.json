This excellent drivetrain combination allows for ample acceleration and great highway cruising speeds. The exterior matches that powerhouse exceptionally well with a dazzling white and black two-tone paint which shows off the car’s performance with a variety of racing stripes and a functional spoiler that helps the rear wheels to stay on the ground with ease. All of this adds up to an incredible ‘70s muscle car that will always be able to deliver tons of fun at the turn of a key."
