After all, a new cat can set you back several hundred dollars, which is why these punks steal them using a Sawzall. We personally think they should have to pay for making people suffer all because they just want a quick buck, so it made us laugh to see some people take action and hit a couple of catalytic converter thieves with a barrage of paintballs."

Then you hear the noise of the pair sawing through the exhaust system to harvest the valuable cat. An alarm goes off and the pair is momentarily scared, but after it’s turned off they get back to work."
