<p>This could possibly be the world’s only front-wheel-drive <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/you-could-own-this-highly-custom-c4-corvette/">Corvette</a>, and you can see it soon at the Corvette Museum.

<p><br>John Jacobi got the inspiration to build this creation out of practicality and his curiosity to that drove him to do things no one else has tried before.</p>
<p>“My dad… strived to do things differently than most,” Jacobi’s daughter, Tara, told the Corvette Museum. “At the time, we lived on Long Island where winters brought snow,” Tara wrote. </p>
<p>“My dad wanted a front-wheel-drive vehicle for all-weather handling. Also, after repairing numerous rusty cars, he wanted a fiberglass body.”<br>Instead of picking something already made for the market, he decided to source a junkyard <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1979-chevrolet-corvette/">1979 Corvette</a> body, and made it work with a 1979 Cadillac Eldorado chassis from a local junkyard. His plan with to cut 16-inches off the chassis’ wheelbase, and then drop the Corvette body on it.</p>

<p><br>The project turned out to be quite the undertaking as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1963-chevrolet-corvette-rare-option/">Corvette body</a> rode too high on the chassis, so a chassis specialist was enlisted to section the frame rails, cut the coils springs, and adjust the torsion bars.</p>
<p><br>Once all of the other components were put together like a jigsaw puzzle, the build would get a 350 cubic inch engine from an Oldsmobile, and mated it to a THM325. A hole had to be cut to accolade the engine, and a radiator had to be customized and cooled by electric fans.</p>
