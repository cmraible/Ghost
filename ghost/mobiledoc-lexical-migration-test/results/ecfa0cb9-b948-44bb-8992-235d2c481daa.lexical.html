<p>Good things are happening! One Circuit Court invalidated Trump era land sales to oil companies, while another affirmed the Biden administration’s pause on leasing for oil and gas projects. Vancouver, meanwhile, is planning to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their disastrous contributions to the climate crisis. Also, the Federal Reserve announced its first steps to require banks to disclose their readiness for renewable energy transformation, and Hawaii shut down its last coal-powered plant.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of You Love To See It, available below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Earthjustice/status/1564656693371363336">win</a> for frontline communities in the Gulf of Mexico, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/grn_v_haaland.pdf">ruled</a> last week that the Trump administration illegally sold millions of acres to oil companies in 2018. This decision follows the January 2022 <a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2022/court-finds-massive-offshore-oil-lease-sale-in-gulf-based-on-faulty-legal-analysis">decision</a> by the D.C. District Court that held the Department of Interior responsible for a faulty and grossly underestimated analysis of environmental impacts in the largest fossil fuel lease sale in U.S. history.</p>
<p>“These twin rulings require Interior to start with a blank slate and consider the full environmental costs associated with auctioning off U.S. public waters to the fossil fuel industry,” environmental group Earthjustice said in a <a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2022/federal-court-sends-two-unlawful-trump-era-offshore-oil-lease-sales-in-gulf-of-mexico-back-to-department-of?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_term=feed&ms=twitter">statement</a>. “Conservation groups are confident that a full assessment will lead to the undeniable conclusion that holding a lease sale will cause irreparable harm to Gulf communities.”</p>

<h3 id="vancouver-to-sue-big-oil">Vancouver To Sue Big Oil</h3>
<p>In July, the Vancouver City Council passed a <a href="https://twitter.com/WCELaw/status/1549913321406468099">motion</a> earmarking funds for a class action lawsuit against fossil fuel companies. Their goal: Making oil giants pay for their major role in the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The motion, led by Vancouver City Councilor Adriane Carr, seeks to allocate $1 for every one of the city’s more than 660,000 residents. The idea came from the public campaign launched by a coalition of British Columbian environmental groups called <a href="https://suebigoil.ca/historic-win-vancouver-votes-to-fund-climate-lawsuit-against-big-oil/">Sue Big Oil</a>.</p>
<p>Vancouver would be the first Canadian city to join what is now a growing movement of more than 20 U.S. states and municipalities suing fossil fuel companies.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl affirmed the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/">pause</a> on fossil fuel leasing, <a href="https://westernlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022.09.02-Wyoming-Leasing-Pause-Victory-ORder.pdf">rejecting</a> Big Oil challenges to the hiatus.</p>

<p>“We find it reassuring that the court affirmed the Bureau of Land Management’s authority to postpone oil and gas lease sales in order to make certain they adhere to the law,” <a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/court-rejects-wyoming-industry-challenge-to-biden-administration-postponement-of-oil-gas-lease-sales-2022-09-06/">said</a> Melissa Hornbein, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, which intervened in the case to defend the pause. “The judge called out as nonsensical the state and industry group’s argument that postponing a lease to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires a NEPA analysis of its own. This suggests any appeal of this decision will have an uphill battle in court.”</p>
<h3 id="federal-reserve-could-rein-in-big-banks%E2%80%99-climate-recklessness">Federal Reserve Could Rein In Big Banks’ Climate Recklessness</h3>
<p>This Wednesday, Michael Barr, vice chair for supervision at the Federal Reserve, <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/federal-reserve-to-begin-action-on-climate-in-2023/">announced</a> that the Fed will require financial institutions to assess how their financial planning accounts for climate change impacts.</p>
<p>David Arkush, managing director of Public Citizen’s climate program, <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/federal-reserve-to-begin-action-on-climate-in-2023/">said</a>, “Recently enacted policies like those in the Inflation Reduction Act and in the state of California will propel the clean-energy transition faster than was expected just a couple of months ago. That means big banks that are still financing fossil fuels are at even greater risk of those assets being stranded and their loans going unpaid. The Fed needs to rein in their recklessness.”</p>
<h3 id="hawaii-closes-its-last-coal-energy-plant">Hawaii Closes Its Last Coal Energy Plant</h3>
<p>In 2020, Hawaii’s legislature passed a <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2020/bills/SB2629_HD1_.htm">law</a> to end coal-fueled energy production by 2023. Last week, the state followed through on its promise by shutting down its last coal powered plant as it tries to rapidly transition to renewables. Hawaii was the first state to mandate a complete transition to renewable energy by 2045, and already, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-09-01/hawaii-closes-last-coal-fired-power-plant">40 percent</a> of its power comes from sustainable sources.</p>
<p>A third of Hawaii’s single family homes have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/business/hawaii-solar-energy.html">rooftop solar panels</a>, and its fourth largest island, Kauai, expects to produce 90 percent of electricity from carbon free sources by 2025.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Anne Carson’s poem on strange creatures, “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/158327/between-us-and">Between Us And</a>”:</p>
<p><em>BETWEEN US AND</em></p>
<p><em>animals is a namelessness.</em></p>
