When revealing it will deploy 7 different special-edition models for 2023, the official press release says both muscle cars “are coming to an end” but only “in current form.” That could mean just about anything, so obviously the automaker wants everyone guessing until a reveal is made."

A car carrier was parked outside the Dodge Garage Party where the first evening of Speed Week announcements were made, each car loaded on it donning a cover announcing the dates of when the reveals will take place. Think of it like a Mopar advent calendar of sorts."

Dodge did something similar with the Viper when it rode into the sunset for 2017. While the Viper special editions were made in small numbers, we’d expect there will be more for the Charger and Challenger final sendoff. Still, you might need to be quick and lucky to get your hands on any of them. There’s little doubt these will all become instant collectibles."

Expect each one to have some connection to Dodge models from the 60s and 70s. Maybe we’ll finally get a modern factory Daytona with the nose cone and wing."

That means no putting your name on a list at a dealer and hoping for the best, only for you to never receive one. Still, we think so many people will be clamoring for the cars once the allocations have been announced, you’ll need to move fast to secure anything the least bit hot (hint: Hellcats)."
