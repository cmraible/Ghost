          "A thief who stole a Dodge Challenger was shot by police in Newark, New Jersey back on the morning of March 15 and another was arrested. According to a local report, it was reported stolen from a “7-Eleving” in Asbury Park the day before, which either is a weird New Jersey chain or the 7-Eleven we all know. Also, they reported the stolen vehicle was a Dodge Charger, even though the image clearly shows a Challenger. This is the state of our education system these days."

That’s always a bad idea because in most jurisdictions it’s considered assault with a deadly weapon. Cops absolutely will open fire and justifiably so, which was exactly what the officer did, hitting the driver multiple times. We’re guessing he spends a lot of time at the range and deserves a pay bump for keeping his skills finely tuned."

Since we closely monitor the news about such crimes and work to keep enthusiasts aware that they need to take extra measures to secure their vehicle, we’re keenly aware of the problem. Too many times these guys get caught and are back on the street by dinner so they can keep stealing cars, especially in states like New Jersey. And while we don’t celebrate people getting hurt, in this case you can’t help but feel there’s some form of karma at work."
