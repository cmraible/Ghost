<hr>
<p>People will <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/look-on-in-horror-at-these-12-valuable-barn-find-cars/">stash cars in all kinds of crazy places</a>. We’ve written about a fair share of true barn finds, as well as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">cars hidden away in warehouses</a>, fields, semi-truck trailers, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/six-classic-cars-found-sunk-in-a-river/">rivers</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-1988-mazda-rx-7-turbo-is-a-genuine-basement-find/">even one in a basement</a>. This 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wildbody-daytona-rendering/">Dodge Charger Daytona</a> is the first we’ve covered that was sitting in a mobile home trailer. What would possess a person to do such a thing is a question better answered by a psychologist, so we’re not even going to try. Even better, we’re going to marvel at the amazing condition this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> is in now that it’s been cleaned up.</p>

<p>Not only was this now-beautiful Charger Daytona dirty, it was in pieces. It wasn’t until 2019 the owner pulled the muscle car out and started assembling it. That’s sadly all too common for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/grandma-stashes-two-exotics-in-garage/">someone to stash a car for so long without using a car cover</a>, stabilizing fluids, etc. then suddenly pull it out and get it back to its former glory. You see in the video it looks like it was stored properly with a cover. Usually these cars which have been sitting for decades is the product of an owner who lacks drive, but that’s apparently not the case here. There is a story behind it you can hear in the video.</p>

<p>Lest you get too excited, this Dodge Charger Daytona isn’t going to be hitting the market anytime soon. The owner is getting it back in shape <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-petersen-museum-announces-digital-cars-coffee-event/">so he can drive and show it off</a>. That’s great news since cars were made for that very thing, not just sitting like a painting in a gallery.</p>
<p>The Daytona owner has some big plans. There are still other cars stashed in the trailer. One of them is a Plymouth Hemi ‘Cuda, a muscle car with a legend larger than life and is guaranteed to cause a huge stir wherever you take it.</p>
