Perhaps it's the shaved rear bumper and 302 cubic-inch V8 in place of the Pinto's stock engine, but either way, you probably don't have to worry about another Stilletto showing up the same car show. The listing says that the car has been repainted and it's currently running, but there's still a little more work to be done to get this Pinto roadworthy."
