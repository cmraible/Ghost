The whole point of the operation was to bust anyone racing on public streets or running an exhaust which is too loud per state regulations."

Eric Little of the Newport Beach Police Department’s traffic division told the Los Angeles Times there’s been an increasing problem with these violations since the government shut down all recreation areas and most businesses, telling everyone to huddle in their home or crowd into big box stores until further directives. We can’t possibly imagine why anyone would then turn to illegal street racing as an outlet. After all, wearing a mask at home while eating Doritos and watching Netflix is so much safer."

The most horrifying example is the teenager who hit a mother and her baby while on parole. That offender had previously been convicted of felony poisoning from spiking a teenage girl’s drink in 2019. While that’s not a big deal, having a loud exhaust or racing on public streets is. We’re not condoning street racing, but something feels off here."
