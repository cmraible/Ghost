That means we’re seeing all the collectible cars which were trashed by the storm, like a couple of Ferraris and some other rides in Naples, Florida. The photos, which were shared with Naples Daily News by a resident, show that a residential garage is hardly ample protection against a Cat 4 hurricane."

The car itself seems to have a number of dents, the lower fascia cracked and falling apart in numbers spots, and the windshield is blown out. In short, the poor 488 looks like it’s been through hell and back."

Plenty of debris surround the British sports car, with the garage door cable resting on the vehicle. Clearly, the passenger side of the F-Type has been battered a lot, and the rear fascia doesn’t look so pretty, either."

There’s a fair amount of damage done to the Ferrari’s front bumper, but even more concerning is that the garage door looks like it’s been peeled up, the Bentley’s nose sticking through the opening created by the storm. It’s hard to tell from the camera angle, but it appears the rear of the 575 is also hanging out, so who knows how much damage was done back there."
