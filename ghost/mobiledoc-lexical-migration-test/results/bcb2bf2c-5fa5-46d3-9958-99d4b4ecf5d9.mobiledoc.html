<p>Some unique <a href="https://getcareprotected.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">benefits of CARE+</a> include a $300 flatbed towing benefit. With a flatbed tow truck, damage is less likely. Your vehicle doesn’t have direct contact with the road or the surface because all the vehicle’s wheels are on the flatbed. This contributes greatly to reduced wear and tear that could be caused due to friction with the surface, or misaligned movable parts such as the wheels. For classic cars, flat bed towing is the standard rather than the exception. Protect your car’s transmission, engine parts, and other systems that could be damaged were the vehicle towed on its wheels.</p>
