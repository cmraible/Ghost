<p>In the weeks since the East Palestine train derailment, <em>The Lever</em> has spotlighted the governmental decisions that deregulated the nation’s rail system. That reporting shamed the national press into echoing our coverage — which was soon credited by lawmakers for raising public awareness of some of the biggest rail safety loopholes that were baked into America’s laws by corporate lobbyists and captured regulators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgKRJR9N1_c">Watch</a> our new video detailing how our coverage changed the national dialogue around rail safety — and then share it on social media and forward this email to friends and family.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sgKRJR9N1_c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>We don’t answer to corporations — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-lobbyist-turned-senator-could-block-safety-bill/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way to force those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
