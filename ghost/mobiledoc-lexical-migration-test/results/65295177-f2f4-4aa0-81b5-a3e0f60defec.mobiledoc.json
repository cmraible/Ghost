Though far from scientific, this video does give us a good look at how the Corvette would look in a street race with the Lamborghini. The Corvette gets an incredible – if not early – jump off the line against the Huracán, but it still takes about three quarters of the track's length for the Lamborghini to catch up. Same thing with the 40-mph roll: an early jump off the line gives the Corvette a hefty advantage, which the Lamborghini's raw power overcomes at the finish line."

Yes, the timing of the two drivers is far from accurate, but this lightly tuned C8 Corvette still performs amazing next to the superior power from the Huracán. There's no doubt the new Corvette will be compared to sports cars from around the world, and we can't wait to see what Hennessey Performance might have in store for the C8's performance with a twin-turbo setup."
