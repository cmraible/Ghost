<p><strong>Malwarebytes 4.0 </strong>(formerly known as<strong> Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</strong>) is considered to be the best anti-malware application available today. Malwarebytes is constantly updating their database in order to continue improving the application’s amazing malware detection and removal success. The software was built from scratch to be as efficient and effective as possible. It uses technologies that are designed to quickly detect, destroy, and prevent malware. </p>
<p><strong>Malwarebytes 4.0</strong> can detect and remove malware that even the most well known anti-virus and anti-malware applications fail to detect. One of the key’s to success is its <strong>Realtime Protection Module</strong> which uses Malwarebytes’ advanced heuristic scanning technology to monitor your computer to ensure it remains safe and secure. The latest version of Malwarebytes 4.0 also features <strong>Anti-Ransomware</strong> and <strong>Anti-Exploit</strong> technologies to keep your computer safe from all sorts of baddies including zero-day threats.</p>

<p>The <strong>latest version</strong> of the software was launched in November 2019, with a completely redesigned UI to give users more intuitive control over their malware protection. <strong>Malwarebytes 4.0</strong> also has improved Anti-Ransomware, Anti-Exploit, Anti-Rootkit, and Chameleon self-protection technologies, along with a new and improved detection and removal engine. The flip-side of all these innovations and advances is that the software has gone from a free version to a yearly paid subscription model. The good news, though, is that it’s a great deal at $39.99 per year, for one PC. For such a powerful tool, that’s a small price to pay.</p>
