For some it’s like the promise of buried treasure they could possibly uncover. For others the stories make them mad that anyone would let such a precious vehicle rot. But don’t judge too quickly, because this guy isn’t quite like that."

The Hemi Orange paint, white stripe, and white interior makes it distinct. Of course, it’s sitting in the garage and is obviously the guy’s pride and joy. He’s added some mods and apparently it used to run the quarter mile in the 12s. It was also featured in "
