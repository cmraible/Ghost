<p>General Motors struck gold with the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11805">Chevelle nameplate</a>. The model was available in four different body styles, powered by a slew of engine options, spread over the span of three different generations during one of the most iconic eras in automotive history. As such, it is not all that surprising that the 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle was considered to be America’s most popular mid-size car. However, one of the most coveted options was the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11805">Chevelle SS 396</a> of which fewer were produced. Despite relatively large production numbers, it can be hard to find a well preserved example that hasn’t been tinkered with.</p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11805">This classic Chevelle SS</a> convertible is finished in a very attractive black paint coat with black interior. As it says in the title, powering this old-school Chevelle convertible is a L35 396-cubic-inch big-block V8 engine finished in correct Chevy Orange and topped with a Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor.</p>
