Everyone is wondering what kind of moron would do such a thing, and we don’t have a logical reason because it’s absolutely a stupid thing to do."

Her, some kids, and other people off camera can be heard exclaiming in disbelief as the guy is obviously really pushing the C8 Corvette to get through the water. He makes it, but the situation could have easily turned into disaster."

That’s when the people note it has Washington plates, concluding that’s why he drove through the standing water. We’re pretty sure there are floods in Washington, after all there are floods in Phoenix, so we don’t think that’s the reason why he did such a thing."

While the water was completely over the hood, the front of the vehicle pushed out enough of a wake to allow the top of the side scoops to draw in fresh air instead of just gulping water. If he had slowed down or stopped, it could’ve been curtains for the Corvette, so good thing he just kept going at a quick enough pace."
