<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week, prominent progressive elected officials publicly credited <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s work for challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and breaking open one of the biggest corruption scandals in America.  We want to keep doing this work — but we need your help.</p>

<p>In case you missed it: While corporate media outlets spent last year <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cuomo-and-the-lincoln-project-are/">lauding</a> Cuomo, <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been investigating how Cuomo helped major industry donors shield nursing home executives from legal consequences, and then withheld information about thousands of nursing home deaths. This isn’t just a New York story — as <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/exclusive-states-are-copying-and/">The Daily Poster</a></em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/exclusive-states-are-copying-and/"> first reported</a>, Cuomo’s corporate immunity law subsequently went national.</p>
<p>This scandal is now engulfing New York as Cuomo reportedly faces a <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Cuomo-15957401.php">federal law enforcement probe</a> — and our reporting has been a big part of exposing the back-room machinations. You don’t have to believe me about that.  Believe Assemblyman Ron Kim, the New York Democratic lawmaker who is now allegedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/nyregion/nursing-homes-cuomo-ron-kim.html">facing retribution</a> from Cuomo for demanding answers about the questions our stories raised:</p>

<p>Another New York Democratic lawmaker demanding answers also publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/yuhline/status/1362808258285744133">thanked</a><em>The Daily Poster</em> “for continuously asking for the numbers and covering what is happening in our nursing homes and hospitals and keeping us informed.”</p>
