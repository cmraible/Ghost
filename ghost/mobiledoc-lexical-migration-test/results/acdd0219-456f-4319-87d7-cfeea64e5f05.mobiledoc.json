Instead of being a kit, this widebody has been built by hand and only one was made. Alpine White paint always looks good on an air-cooled Porsche 911, while the red stripes and black graphics add a nice touch. On the modern end of things are Bi-Xenon projector headlights, so you’ll have a clear view of wherever you take this machine at night."

Many consider this to be the best flat-six engine Porsche ever made, especially since it allows you to rev high and have a lot of fun. It’s also the last of the air-cooled engines. Mated up to the flat-six is a new 915 5-speed manual transmission and a Wevo short-shifter. There are also upgraded 930 transaxles and custom headers included in this build. A Brembo big brake kit adds some much-needed balance so you can stick turns and make emergency maneuvers with confidence."

Invoices and paperwork related to this build are also available. Considering the fantastic upgrades installed in this good-looking Porsche 911, the Buy It Now price of $145,000 seems like a relative deal. There’s a strong possibility it could go for over that amount, unless someone beats everyone to punch and scoops it first."
