          "These days it’s not too unusual to hear about law enforcement in countries like Australia seizing a car as it’s being imported from a foreign country. What is shocking is to hear New South Wales police took a 1960 Bentley S2 that’s supposedly worth over $140 million. After all, the most expensive classic Bentley we’ve ever heard of was the 1932 Blower which sold at auction in the UK for $7 million."

A tipster told police they ought the inspect the British car as it was shipped from Canada to a buyer Down Under. They decided to serve a warrant for the car at the home after it was delivered, then proceeded to X-ray the classic, revealing it indeed was carrying hidden cargo."

After police went through the vehicle with a fine-tooth comb, they netted not only 350 pounds of meth but 132 pounds of cocaine. Police say the street value of the illegal drugs is about $115 million, hence why the classic Bentley value was so high."
