Algus, who is the most senior member and leader of the gang, is a wizard/mage type who can shoot projectiles from his staff. Kyuli is more of a ninja type character where she can also shoot projectiles in the shape of a bow and arrow. The difference between her weapon and Algus’ is that her arrows can travel further (across the whole screen unless they hit a wall or obstruction) but Algus’ has a quicker firing rate and his staff projectiles can fire through walls, so you start to see how strategy comes into play. Finally, Arias is a knight armed with a sword which is powerful but obviously has much less of a reach than the weapons of Algus and Arias.",

It’s such a shame because I’ve played a few Metroidvanias where the map just needs a bit more care and attention to detail. You don’t want a map that holds your hand but equally, being able to use the map as a key tool or asset adds to the experience. One frustration, for example, is that after buying a certain upgrade from Epimetheus, you can track on the map where locked doors are. Say you go to a room and it needs a blue key to progress, then a blue key icon will appear on that tile on the map; so far so good, right? However, there are other icons, like a small dot indicating that an item can be collected and if there is more than one icon on the same tile – let’s say a locked door AND an item – then the map tile only shows one, not both. This may sound pernickety but it was frustrating at times. Also, the fast travel elevators have names which you can select when you get in the lift but there’s no way of knowing what each elevator is called. For example, there are elevator locations called ‘Gorgon Tomb 1’ and ‘Gorgon Tomb 2’ but on the map, you have no idea which one is which, so I kept getting a lift to the wrong one and having to get back in the lift again.
