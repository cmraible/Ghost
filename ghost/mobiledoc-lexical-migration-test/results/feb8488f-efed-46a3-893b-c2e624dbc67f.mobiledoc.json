As one of the last front-engined V12 Ferraris, the 400 holds a special place in the hearts of Ferrari enthusiasts and collectors."

          "Under the Hood: The heart of the Ferrari 400 lies in its formidable powertrain. Nestled under the elongated hood, a 4.8-liter V12 engine roars to life, producing 315 horsepower and 312 lb-ft of torque. This potent powerplant, mated to a five-speed manual transmission, propels the car from 0 to 60 mph in just over seven seconds, delivering exhilarating acceleration. The top speed of approximately 150 mph ensures that the 400 remains a capable grand tourer even by today's standards."
