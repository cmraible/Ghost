These are a small fraction of the 168,323 (not updated for post-2020, so probably a ton more) stolen cars each and every year in the state, but maybe criminals will see it as a warning, probably not."

What is shocking is the aerial image that shows all this; the cars are tightly squeezed on a narrow suburban lot, with the cars not hidden so well. Another odd thing, they all seem to be intact, but slowly turning into the next collector car grave yard. Here’s to hoping these cars won’t be destroyed because of this low life’s past time of taking other people’s stuff."
