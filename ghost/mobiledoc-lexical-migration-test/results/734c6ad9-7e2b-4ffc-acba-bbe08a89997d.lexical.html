<p>Highlighting this year’s Palm Beach Auction is a 2018 Ford GT ’67 Heritage Edition with less than 15 miles on the odometer. This ’67 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/359164/hertiage-gt-auction">Heritage Edition</a> is finished in Race Red with white racing stripes and features the exclusive No. 1 race-number graphics paying homage to the 1967 Le Mans-winning GT40 Mark IV race car driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt. Also crossing the block is a 1963 Chevrolet Custom Corvette Split-Window built by Jeff Hayes Customs. Sitting on an Art Morrison chassis, this split-window ’vette is powered by an LS3 Hot Cam Engine producing 540 horsepower. The Palm Beach Auction will also include a stunning 1970 Dodge HEMI Challenger R/T powered by a 426ci HEMI V8 engine paired to a 4-speed manual transmission. This Challenger also won Best in Class at the Forest Grove Concours d’Elegance.</p>

The gorgeous Corvette underwent a full nut-and-bolt restoration. Joining the ’vette is a custom 1950 Chevrolet Woody Wagon with over 6,000 hours invested in the build.
