<p>Time waits for no man. It's hard to believe that a fourth gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-camaro-black-label-ls7/">Camaro Z28</a> is old enough to be considered <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1956-mercedes-benz-300sl/">a classic</a>, let alone a "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gt350h-worth-salvaging/">barn find</a>."</p>
<p>Popular YouTube channel Hoovies Garage recently found a low mileage, mint condition 1993 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 that hasn't been on the road in ten years.</p>

<p>Given the incredible appearance of this car, you might expect to find out that this wasn't some car that was parked since the '90s with a couple thousand miles on it.</p>
<p>In fact, this car has over 80,000 miles, but it's been well cared-for. The story goes that it was a high school graduation present for the original owner. In 2010, it wouldn't start, and it's sat ever since.</p>

<p>In the video, Hoovie attempts to get this Camaro back on the road. Initially, the issue appears to be a bad fuel pump. Once they get the Camaro up on the lift, they discover a few surprises.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these LT1 engines are notorious for the Optispark distributor, which is often damaged by a failing water pump. That looks to be the case here, and some leaking gaskets are also observed.</p>

<p>Some upgrades are discovered, too, such as subframe connectors, drilled and slotted brake rotors, and a Flowmaster cat-back exhaust system. At this stage, Hoovie sits back and watches his mechanic drop the tank and replace the fuel pump.</p>
<p>With the pump replaced and the fuel lines cleaned out, the Camaro seems like it wants to start, but it just won't. A backfire starts a small fire, but thankfully there was an extinguisher nearby to prevent any serious damage.</p>
<p>Once the injectors have been cleaned, the Camaro lives! There's still some deferred maintenance to take care of, but now Hoovie can drive and enjoy his Z28.</p>
