So, it’ll come as a happy surprise to hear that the house used in Ricky Bobby‘s film has recently come onto the real estate market. That’s right, you could find yourself sitting on the same floor as Ricky Bobby and blasting some Hardcore rock ‘n’ roll while working on your car in the garage."

Of course, whoever purchases this home will probably be looking more into the Ricky Bobby aspect than anything else. However, probably the coolest feature about the vehicle is that, being located around the Charlotte North Carolina region, it’s pretty close to a lot of NASCAR team headquarters. All these things make the house a really interesting prospect for pretty much any car enthusiast but the real question is if it really worth $4.2 million."
