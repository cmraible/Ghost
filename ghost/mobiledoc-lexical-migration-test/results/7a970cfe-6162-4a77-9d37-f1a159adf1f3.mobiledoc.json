Before too long, a patrol unit came across one of those vehicles, a yellow Ford Mustang, because a ride like that doesn’t stick out at all. Instead of doing the smart thing and just pulling over to talk to the cops, the driver decided to make a run for it."

In fact, in the newly released dashcam footage of the incident, you can hear a police sergeant order his officer to not pursue. This is a pretty common tactic when dealing with a non-violent offender in many jurisdictions since they know sooner or later they’ll have their man."

The catch was the police obtained a solid description of him as the driver as well as the license plate."

He hadn’t registered the car, which no doubt was partly why he didn’t want to stop. Also, he probably thought he could get away for the same reason. The woman didn’t know his name, but she of course had his Facebook info. That was enough for police to figure out who he is."

Naturally, the best thing to do when that’s your life situation is to buy a Mustang and race other drivers. Armed with that information, police showed up at Cornelius’ apartment and arrested him. Then he threw a hissy fit in the back of the car."
