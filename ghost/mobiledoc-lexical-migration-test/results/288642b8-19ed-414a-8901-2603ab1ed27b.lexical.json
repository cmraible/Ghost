However, when he came back, his son had also taken an interest in the sport, and the father-son team began winning races left and right. While this seems like a story of a loving father reuniting with his son and bonding over a mutual love for cars and racing, a lot was going on under the surface.",

This led to a 25-year sentence which he nearly eluded in a prison escape attempt involving a mixture of hot sauce and sawdust. In 1980 he met a married woman named Chalice Benette, soon marrying. Unfortunately, things were not all sunshine and rainbows for the couple as the relationship turned toxic, eventually ending in divorce. After the divorce, John and Chalice \"took a trip\" to Key West, Florida. Once again, John Paul remarried a Woman named Colleen Wood, who would soon disappear on a trip with John Paul on his boat \"The Island Girl.\" The last person to go missing with John Paul was eventually himself as he vanished in 2001 with only rumors to give information on his whereabouts. Some reports have said that he is in the Bahamas or another island nation, but I think it's safe to say that wherever this menace is, he ought to stay there for the sake of everyone. ",
