<p>Handy little addition to Youtube I spotted the other day: you can now specify exactly the width (or height) of an embed code for a YouTube video. This has been niggling me since the service upped the default width to wider than the column size of this blog. I had to manually work out the height and width and modify the embed code, which was a complete pain.</p>
<p>Simple addition, but it’ll make life so much easier.</p>
