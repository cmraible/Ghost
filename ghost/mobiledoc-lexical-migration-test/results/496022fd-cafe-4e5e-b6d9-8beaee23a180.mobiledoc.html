<p>If the new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/second-chance-at-shelbys/">Shelby</a> GT500 and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/381232/jack-roush-edition-mustang-collector-car">Jack Roush Edition Mustang</a> aren't powerful enough for your taste, Shelby American has introduced the latest high-powered Mustang for enthusiasts to drool over. The Signature Series <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/395401/shelby-mustang-counterfeiter-collection-auction">Mustang</a> packs 825 horsepower along with a long list of Shelby-specific tuning upgrades, and with production limited to just 50 units, this car is sure to be an instant collector car â€“ even with its $127,795 price tag.</p>

<p>To hit 825 horsepower, Shelby strapped a Whipple supercharger on top of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/398797/co-ford-dealer-employee-crashes-2020-mustang-gt-during-joyride">Mustang GT's</a> Coyote V8, and engine cooling was also upgraded with Shelby components such as a radiator, aluminum tank and heat exchanger. A Borla exhaust system allows the engine to breathe better, and it should give the supercharged V8 an incredible exhaust note. And to make sure this car can handle all this power, everything from the wheel studs to the drive shaft and half shafts have been upgraded.</p>
<p>For improved handling, the Mustang's MagneRide suspension system received a special tune from Shelby, and the Brembo brake system gets a Shelby-exclusive brake duct cooling system. This car also comes with massive 20x11-inch forged aluminum wheels wrapped in 305-series Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, and available options include a wide-body package and rear seat delete with racing harness bar.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/382639/2020-1967-shelby-gt500-drag-race">GT500</a>, Shelby's Signature Series Mustang is available in coupe and convertible with the choice of manual and automatic transmissions. While the Shelby GT350 and GT500 continue to use the pre-facelifted Mustang (2015-18), the Signature Series Mustang is based on the 2020 Mustang GT with the updated design, so that's another selling point for those who like this look more. Adding to this more aggressive styling is a redesigned front grille with winglets, splitter and air ducts, a functional ram air hood and aluminum fenders with heat extractors, while side extensions, a taller rear spoiler and restyled rear bumper finish off the Shelby-specific design.</p>
