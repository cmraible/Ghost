<p>Cuphead was a Windows/Xbox One exclusive title that featured classic 1930s animation and difficult platforming levels. ManaVoid Entertainment must have saw the success and wish to recreate a similar styled game in the form of an RPG entitled <em>Steamboat Billy The Curse of the Leviathan</em>.</p>
<p>Steamboat Billy requires you to…</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Explore, fight and collect chroma-crazed creatures while sailing the sea in an epic adventure-RPG inspired by Zelda, Pokémon & Cuphead!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game needs $66,076AUD to reach its initial pledge and is currently sitting on $39,792AUD with just 16 days to go at the time of this article. The game is estimated to release in November 2019.</p>

<p>ManaVoid Entertainment has this to say about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most succinctly described as <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> meets <em>Pokémon</em>, <em><strong>Steamboat Billy</strong></em> is a singleplayer adventure-RPG set in a classic <em>Disney</em>-like universe in which you must defeat and capture strange monsters while sailing the dark seas, in order to rebuild and bring back color to the world you once knew! Once every millennia, the Great Leviathan emerges from the ocean’s depths to curse the world into monochromatic chaos! By exploring land and sea, collecting treasures and creatures along the way, you will need to combat the Leviathan’s cronies and rebuild the city of Star Harbor in order to restore the color to the world! As fans of classic American cartoons of the 1930s, Steamboat Billy’s art style is very much an homage to that era, albeit with a few differences. We’ve added some anime flair to our characters and we aren’t afraid of mixing in modern animation techniques and visual effects.</p>
