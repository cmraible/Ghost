That’s exactly what’s happening and we suspect it will turn quite a few heads. All of the cars being offered for sale to the public have been featured in the Transformers franchise, so they’re quite iconic, adding to their collectability considerably. However, there’s a catch: you have to buy them all together."

That fact alone should draw plenty of attention to these movie cars, which would make a unique and memorable addition to any collection, large or small. These vehicles are all being sold through Curated for $2,000,000."
