<p>This concours-correct <a href="https://app.cx.auction/auctions/607ef72df72389002cb58e37">1970 HEMI ‘Cuda</a> was expertly restored by Roger Gibson and Frank Badalson. If you know those two names, then you know this car has to be a true survivor of a car with all matching numbers meant to take the driver back to the golden years of Mopar muscle. With the original engine, transmission, and body panels, all of the tags on this car match the factory stamped VIN perfectly. Additionally, <a href="https://app.cx.auction/auctions/607ef72df72389002cb58e37">the car</a> is accompanied by its original fender tag and broadcast sheet. It is also listed on the Galen Govier Registry as well. <br></p>

<p>As the high performance version of the Barracuda, the <a href="https://app.cx.auction/auctions/607ef72df72389002cb58e37">1970 Plymouth ‘Cuda</a> came equipped with a beefier suspension and frame capable of handling the 425-horsepower supplied by the legendary 426 HEMI. Additional options include power brakes and a 3.23:1 gear ratio. While performance was clearly a top priority for this car, Plymouth did not skimp on driver amenities, and the interior offered such features as a black vinyl upholstery, Rallye gauges, a center console, a light group, and a tape player. All of which this particular car came with. </p>
