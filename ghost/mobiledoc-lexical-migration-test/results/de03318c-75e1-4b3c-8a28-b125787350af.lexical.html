<p>Despite his tremendous business success, he never forgot his rural roots. Well after becoming a multimillionaire, he continued to drive the same red and white 1979 Ford F-150 that had served him well for years.</p>
<p>This YouTube video shows Jay Leno and Wal-Mart teaming up to build a modern version of Walton's truck. the original is on display at the Walmart Heritage Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas.</p>

<p>Retro-styled pickup trucks are growing in popularity. We love the classic two-tone paintjob on this new F-150, and the white steel wheels with polished center caps also lend themselves surprisingly well to the modern F-150's overall look. Naturally, they're wrapped with a set of raised white letter tires.</p>
<p>One of the most important modifications to the F-150 was a set of custom dog cages in the pickup bed. Walton loved his dogs, and when he was once asked about why he still drove his beat-up old pickup, he famously quipped, "What am I supposed to haul my dogs around in, a Rolls-Royce?"</p>
