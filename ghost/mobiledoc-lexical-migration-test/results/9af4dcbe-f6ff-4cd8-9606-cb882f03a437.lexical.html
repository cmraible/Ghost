<p>The fourth German owner of this Porsche, Wolf-Hendrick Unger, purchased it in October of 1979. He had a long history of racing and loved the Porsche brand, so this 911 Carrera RS didn’t just sit in the garage. During the nine years it was with this owner, the vehicle took part in events such as the 1982 Monte Carlo Rallye, with credentials still present on the car.</p>
