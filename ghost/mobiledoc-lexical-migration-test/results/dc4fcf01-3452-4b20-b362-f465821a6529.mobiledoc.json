According to an NBC New York report, Mario Cassanova saw the sanitation worker was hitching a 30-yard dumpster to the back of the garbage truck when he jumped into the cab and threatened the worker who was inside. Then he took off, doing as much damage as he could."

It remains to be seen if New York City’s famous no cash bail policy will be applied to this case, allowing Cassanova to walk free, because oddly we couldn’t find any follow-up reports on this case. We did however dig up a story from Gothamist back in November of 2016 detailing out how a man named Mario Cassanova stole and crashed a bus on Staten Island, although we can’t confirm if it was the same guy.
