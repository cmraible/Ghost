While both are Mopars with Hemi V8s, they are incredibly different cars designed to serve in different ways. We also know you’re probably like us and truly have wondered just how fast these cop cars are, so here’s your chance to see how one throws down in the quarter mile."

Maybe the Hellcat Redeye driver wanted to keep things fair, but if both have the opportunity to heat up the rear tires and one doesn’t take it, maybe to avoid getting in trouble with his superiors, we don’t see anything wrong with the other guy taking full advantage."

          "The old saying that you can’t outrun the radio isn’t always true, but it’s good cops have those in their cars. After seeing this Dodge Charger Pursuit get absolutely trounced by the Hellcat Redeye, which ran the quarter mile in a respectable 12.275 seconds at 119.38 mph versus a Honda Civic-like 16.533 seconds at 86.71 mph it’s understandable why we see so many chases with Hellcats go the way they do. As long as the fleeing driver doesn’t wreck out or run out of gas, they can often get away. Just keep in mind the police will eventually catch up with them, so even though these guys might get away at first, they don’t stay out of jail forever."
