<p>Riding a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/motorcycle">motorcycle</a> is great fun, until you come across a reckless driver in a vehicle far outweighing yours. That’s exactly what these motorcyclists faced in the video below, where a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/396586/2020-chevrolet-corvette-starts-production">C8 Chevrolet Corvette</a> pulls a hare-brained maneuver which almost <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/398797/co-ford-dealer-employee-crashes-2020-mustang-gt-during-joyride">causes a crash</a> and costs them dearly.</p>

<p>Why the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet">Chevy</a> driver felt the need to suddenly stop and then start trying to turn left, apparently to make a U-turn, is a mystery. Did he not see the motorcycles? That’s possible, because many drivers don’t, hence the stickers and more encouraging people to be on the lookout for them.</p>
<p>Since we only get a snippet of the video, there’s no telling what, if anything, happened before. For example, the motorcyclists and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImNvcnZldHRlIl19">Chevy Corvette</a> driver might’ve gotten into some sort of altercation before where one felt the other cut them off, was being tailgated, brake-checked, etc. We just don’t know what led up to this situation, or if it just happened out of the blue.</p>
<p>Just stopping in the middle of the highway is a dangerous maneuver, no matter what. You could easily be hit by other drivers going highway speeds, triggering a serious accident. For a rider, that collision would be pretty one-sided and potentially fatal.</p>
<p>If the C8 driver was trying to make a U-turn because he missed an exit, the smart thing would have been to pull off onto the shoulder, triple-check no traffic is coming in either direction, then turn around. As you can see at the end of the video, the Corvette is trying to turn around, but it doesn’t turn a tight-enough circle, so the driver has to reverse and crank the wheel more. That’s an especially dangerous position to be in since the car is blocking both lanes and could be broadsided by another vehicle traveling in either direction.</p>
