<p>Thanks to the whole <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">COVID-19 shutdown situation</a>, there seems to have been a bit of a disruption in flow of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/8-coolest-jdm/">Japanese domestic market vehicles</a> to the United States. Those in the know are always keen to scoop up clean, rare examples of these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">right-hand-drive models</a> since they’re becoming increasingly collectible. One of the most desirable of these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/obscure-jdm-cars/">JDM cars</a> is the NSX, an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/exotic/">exotic supercar</a> which would do quite well in the <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries">Imports and Tuners section</a> of the Motorious Digital Concours online car show.</p>

<p>There’s some debate over the finer differences between a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">hot rod</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/tips/your-street-rod-insurance-appraisal-title-and-registration/amp/">street rod</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1949-chevy-rat-rod-truck/">rat rod</a>. However, it’s clear this custom 1935 Dodge Pickup is indeed a street rod. It looks absolutely fantastic, and while fast it was built primarily to cruise down Main Street, but you can punch it and feel that blast of performance. What’s also amazing is it pulls in some styling cues from the rat rods, while also mixing in some cleverly-hidden comforts. This is the kind of vehicle you could enter into the <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries">Motorious Digital Concours</a>, a virtual car show.</p>

<p>The decision between restoring and restomodding can be a difficult and sometimes polarizing one, but there's no arguing the outcome of this gorgeous <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1970-ford-boss-mustang-300-yellow?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1970 Ford Mustang Boss 302</a>.
