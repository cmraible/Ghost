<hr>
<p>Not all <a href="https://auction.tommackclassics.com/vehicles/896/1958-mack-truck">car collections</a> have to feature high-end luxury cars or performance muscle cars, some of them feature cars that are a little different than the norm. With some of the ‘typical’ players going for insane prices, <a href="https://auction.tommackclassics.com/vehicles/895/1948-mack-truck">collectors</a> are looking outside of the classic Bentleys, Mustangs, Camaros, and Cudas to find something to add to their collection. If this sounds like you, here are some unique <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/hot-august-nights-auction/">Mack trucks</a> that are going to be available at the upcoming Tom Mack Auctions event. Here are two such examples to check out ahead of the event.</p>

<p>This single screw, gas engine truck has a 10-speed transmission. It was restored and parked in a museum in running condition 10 years ago. It’s now a non-running project that could be your next overhaul. See it <a href="https://auction.tommackclassics.com/vehicles/895/1948-mack-truck">here</a>.</p>
