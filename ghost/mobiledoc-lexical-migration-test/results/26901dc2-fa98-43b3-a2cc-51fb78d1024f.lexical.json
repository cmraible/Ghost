That helps explain how a Florida man innocently swung by a Ford dealership a few days before Christmas and excitedly traded in his old Volkswagen Jetta for the brand new off-roader. What he didn’t know was the dealership had sold a demo model to him, which they weren’t supposed to sell to anyone for several months. Now he’s likely the first owner of the new Ford Bronco, but it’s come with some trouble.",
