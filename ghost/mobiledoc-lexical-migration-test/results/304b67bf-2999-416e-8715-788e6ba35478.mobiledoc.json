According to a report from New York Post, the man who submitted the winning bid of $72,500, 24-year-old Joachim Vaturi, claims the seller, chicken magnate Houston Crosta, knew the Ferrari had been stolen. That’s not a light accusation to level at anyone."

The man says he realized the Ferrari was hot a couple of weeks after he bought it, thanks to his mechanic trying to get parts to make some repairs. Ferrari informed the mechanic of the 456 GT’s status and said it was “subject to recall.”"

However, Vaturi claims in a text message after the truth was revealed, Crosta admitted the Ferrari was stolen."
