In his own shop, he has seven of the 20 Nationals known to still be in existence. His passion for finding these antique race cars started when a family friend passed away and left him a trunk with a racing sweater bearing the name “National” on it, thus igniting the curiosity that led to this collection."

There’s not much potential anyway since the engines only rev to about 2000 rpm. “Anything beyond that,” Blain notes, dryly, “and big pieces of metal have a tendency to fly out of the engine.” Also in the collection is a 1912 Packard that is believed to be the oldest Packard race car in existence."
