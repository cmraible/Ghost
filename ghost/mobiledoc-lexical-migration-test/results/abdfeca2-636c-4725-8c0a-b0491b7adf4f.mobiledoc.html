<p>The revered <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> franchise is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year and it wouldn’t be a celebration without having a Zelda game to play. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was first released in 2011 for Nintendo Wii. The original game has gone high definition on Nintendo Switch and is getting remastered for today’s generation to experience and enjoy. The game hit the market last month and here is all that we know about this remaster of the legendary game.</p>
<p><em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD</a></em>is an Nintendo exclusive and it's releasing only on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>In the meantime, gamers have been looking for ways to satisfy their thirst for Zelda’s lush visuals and expansive world gameplay. <a href="https://www.eldorado.gg/genshin-impact-accounts/a/39-0-0"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> is a game very much inspired by Zelda, as an example, which in itself has both compelling stories and quests and stunning anime characters.</p>

<p>Nintendo has released several trailers for <em>Skyward Sword HD</em> which showcased enhanced visuals as well as updated control and bits and pieces on how the game is going to work on the latest Nintendo console. The game is coming up with a unique and whole new functionality and there are considerable adjustments in how the player interacts with objects around them, making the whole experience a lot smoother and convenient for modern players to enjoy.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD </em>definitely retains its soul, from defeating the many varied monsters of Hyrule to solving puzzles around the beautiful yet unforgiving landscape. This attention to character detail has been the inspiration for many games beyond Nintendo, including <a href="https://www.eldorado.gg/animal-crossing-items/i/67-2-0"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe title="Switchaboo Podcast" allowtransparency="true" height="315" width="100%" style="border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);" scrolling="no" data-name="pb-iframe-player" src="https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=3f7t5-a391da-pbblog-playlist&share=1&download=1&rtl=0&fonts=Arial&skin=1&font-color=&order=episodic&limit=10&filter=all&ss=a713390a017602015775e868a2cf26b0&btn-skin=7&size=315" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><em>Skyward Sword HD </em>goes back to the beginning of the whole <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Zelda_Timeline">Zelda timeline</a>. In a time before Ganon and the Master Sword itself. It’s set in a time where Zelda and Link are just students at the Knight academy in the Floating town of Skyloft. After Zelda is abducted, it's up to Link to save her and in this dangerous journey, he will have all the help of his Shield and Sword, hookshot, and many other tools.</p>
<p>There are many improvements in the game but we have to keep in mind that it’s a remaster, not a remake. Because of that, the most prominent changes are only going to be graphics related but even that’s a sight for sore eyes and the game, in every other aspect, is quite frankly a masterpiece. The series is so much more than just gameplay and graphics and that is what makes me super optimistic about the HD version, and with all the information that we’ve seen, I am confident it's going to hit those right notes.</p>
