This has made Tesla stand out among the flood of new electric car manufacturers because it makes them significantly less preachy and easier to digest. One car that paved the way for Musk's automotive brainchild was the Model 3, which has become the company's most popular vehicle. So what makes this car such a great buy for so many drivers across the nation?",
