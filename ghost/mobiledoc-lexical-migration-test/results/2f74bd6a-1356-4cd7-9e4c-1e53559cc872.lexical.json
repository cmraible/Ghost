Just look at how this race went between the Shelby and one of the world's fastest super cars.",

When we discuss straight line speed many often focus too much on the Numbers side of things and somehow seem to forget the heritage of the different cars competing.",

However drag racing is an iconic American sport, basically anybody will have trouble arguing with that. That’s exactly why, while the McLaren did have the upper hand once or twice, the Mustang pulled away from the overpriced canyon carver like it was standing still. All jokes aside, these are too incredible enthusiast-based performance cars that pretty much anybody would be happy to have in their garage, it just so happens the Mustang is faster.",
