Sweetening the deal even more, this 'Vette appears to be a loaded 3LT equipped with the Z51 Performance Package, and the black paint job is complemented by the optional trident-spoke aluminum wheels with gray-painted accents, which are a $1,495 factory option. Bottom line, this mid-engine Corvette will certainly turn heads."
