That doesn’t mean you can’t drive one and still stand out, as clearly proven by this unique looking 2000 Chevy Corvette AAT 1953/2000 Commemorative Edition. It incorporates some of the design aesthetics people love about C1 Corvettes into a more modern package, which you might think combines the best of both worlds."

Even if observers don’t immediately recognize the nose as being inspired by C1 Corvettes, they will realize it’s quite different from what they’re used to seeing and so they will stare."
