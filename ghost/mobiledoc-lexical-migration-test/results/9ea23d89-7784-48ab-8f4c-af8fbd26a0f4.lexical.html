<p>The days of full black body paint and midnight wheels are done and with the fall of this comes a new more energetic era. <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/464/1955-chevrolet-bel-air?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This car</a> isn't only about the looks however, it also comes equipped with a powerful 350 cubic-inch V8 with throttle body electronic fuel injection systems. That purring V8 ensures that this beauty can keep up with the big boys of today's new domestic scene. The car also has all of the simple commodities that we all take for granted sometimes such as power steering, power brakes, custom leather interior, and the one thing we all wish we had in our classics, air conditioning.</p>

<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find a better example of old meets new than this rambunctious ride especially if you're a sucker for the classics.
