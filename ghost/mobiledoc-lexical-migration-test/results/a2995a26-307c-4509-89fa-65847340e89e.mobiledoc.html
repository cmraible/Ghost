<hr>
<p>We hear stories all the time of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alpina-z8-crashed/">rare cars being crashed</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-torch-porsche/">unceremoniously destroyed</a>, but rarely do we find out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wrecked-c8-corvette-rotary-engine-swap/">what fate has in store</a> for these cars. In the case of this ultra-rare <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/197517/1996-mitsubishi-3000gt-vr4">1996 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 Spyder</a>, a devastating collision (while parked) resulted in it being transformed into a custom car that is truly one of a kind.</p>

<p>What you see here is a Mitsubishi 3000GT <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/specially-built-ferrari-488-spyder/">Spyder</a>  that has been customized to look like a Dodge Stealth; the 3000GT and Stealth were Japanese-made sister cars under Chrysler and Mitsubishi's Diamond-Star joint venture. According to the listing, this Mitsubishi had been parked in a driveway when it was hit and totaled. As rare as these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/james-deans-550-spyders-transaxle-is-up-for-sale/">Spyders</a> are, we're glad the owner chose to create a custom build rather than sending this Japanese sports car off to the junkyard.</p>
<p>In a partnership between Mitsubishi and ASC, the 3000GT coupe was assembled in Japan and then shipped to the U.S. where it was transformed into a convertible with an easy-to-use retractable hardtop making it the first such convertible that had been offered the U.S. since the 1959 Ford Fairlane Sunliner. In total, just 1,034 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-porsche-550-spyder/">Spyders</a> were made over the Spyder's two model years (1995 and 1996), and the twin-turbo models are even rare with only 84 examples made in 1996; of those 84, just 21 were painted in white.</p>
<p>Of course, a Dodge Stealth convertible was never made, and that's where this custom creation comes into play. Rather than scrapping this rare-but-wrecked Mitsubishi, it was given a complete rebody to look like a Dodge Stealth. The convertible top, hood, rear decklid and doors appear to be carried over from the 3000GT Spyder, but everything else is what you'll find on a Stealth including the body cladding, wheels and bumpers. Even the Dodge Stealth airbag was added to the interior. This car was done up to look like the Dodge Stealth R/T twin turbo, which is a counterpart to the 3000GT VR-4 this car started its life as. These sports cars featured a 320-horsepower DOHC V6 under the hood, a six-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive.</p>
<p>As is the case with many custom cars, this Dodge Stealth R/T Twin Turbo Convertible (née Mitsubishi 3000GT Spyder VR-4 Spyder) comes with a reconstructed title due to its accident and subsequent rebody, and as such, it's being listed for sale through <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/inventory/dealer/Classic+Auto+Mall">Classic Auto Mall</a> for $13,900. You can click <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/197517/1996-mitsubishi-3000gt-vr4">HERE </a>to make an offer on this custom Mitsubishi, which is perhaps just a quick restoration away from being a show car.</p>
