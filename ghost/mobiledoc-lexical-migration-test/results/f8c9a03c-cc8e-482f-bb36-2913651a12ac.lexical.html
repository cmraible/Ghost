<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/worlds-fastest-c8-corvette/">Corvette</a> is an American hero in the sports car market that rolled off the assembly line on june 30th, 1953. This model came out swinging against the notion that a car can have performance and a certain level of luxury, while also being made in America. What the moniker has evolved into is basically an affordable exotic or supercar, but it's where it came from that we're talking about today. Here are some of the coolest classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rarest-of-the-rare-corvettes/">Corvettes</a> for sale on Motorious.</p>

<p>1964 was the second year of the second generation (C2) Corvette. Gone was the split window and the fake hood vents although the recessed area where the vents were remained. This generation also introduced independent rear suspension, which would remain on the car even to this day. The Sting Ray name also appeared with this generation and this particular model made use of the hood “stinger” as it has come known to be. The love affair continues to this day with the Corvette, straight from the mind of Zora Arkus-Duntov. From Zora Arkus-Duntov's mind, through our consignor's vision and now to your eyes, we offer up this C2 second year 1964 Sting Ray coupe.
