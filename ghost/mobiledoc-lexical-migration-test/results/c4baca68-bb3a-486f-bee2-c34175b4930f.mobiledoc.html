<p>Way back in 1970, the Datsun 510 was purchased in Long Island. We imagine it was cherished by the owner, however it was only driven for a mere 7 years before being parked in a garage. There the Japanese car sat until 2016. Then a guy named Derek saw value in it and bought the car, only for it to sit in his barn for 6 years. Finally, after 44 years of just sitting and gathering grime, the classic is getting a thorough, professional detailing to bring out what beauty is left.</p>

<p>Even though this Datsun is in the very capable hands of AMMO NYC, before watching the detailing we were skeptical just how much luster would still be left in the paint and brightwork after decades of neglect. After all, you can’t bring back what’s completely gone, but we also figured they didn’t post this video just to show a tremendous flop.</p>

<p>Not only is there a fair amount of trash inside the car, which we don’t understand why people treat vehicles like wastebins, there’s also white mold growing on many of the surfaces. There are mouse droppings on the floorboards along with plenty of dirt, just for good measure.</p>
<p>Once the car was cleaned off, they decided to put tape down the middle of the body and only polish up one half of it for comparison’s sake. The goal was to preserve the hard-earned barn-find patina built up on the car, so they weren’t doing paint correction or rust removal. Yeah, we get it, not everyone is into the patina look, but the owner of the Datsun wanted it to keep the look and so professional detailers do what the clients wants.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is a relaxing, interesting video to watch as they really revive the exterior and interior of the 1970 Datsun 510. Check it out for yourself.</p>
