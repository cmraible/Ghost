<p>Thank you for recently joining our political action. <em>The Lever</em> was founded to hold the powerful accountable through breaking news about corruption and money in politics, all from our staff of dedicated investigative journalists. When you joined our political action, you also gained access to our free newsletter sharing critical news. Welcome to our team!</p>

<p>I’m David Sirota, <em>The Lever</em>’s founder and editor-in-chief. Among other things, I’ve been a longtime investigative reporter, a presidential campaign speechwriter for Bernie Sanders, and co-creator of the hit Netflix climate film <em>Don’t Look Up</em>.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I started this news outlet as an independent, reader-supported investigative journalism organization that covers politics, business, and corporate power. We follow the money to uncover corruption, regardless of party or position. Ultimately, we believe that an effective citizen is an informed citizen. So we aim to keep you informed.</p>
