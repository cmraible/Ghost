While this one saw the engine go flying, the front and rear axles also decided to go their separate ways from the body. Some of the body panels and the entire front end also departed from the core of the Chevy Corvette, meaning the C7 is probably just good for only a few parts at this point."

Crews had quite the mess to clean up with parts of the C7 spread over a quarter mile of the freeway. This is a great example of why you take it to the track instead of a busy highway."

He seems to not be critically injured, but the fact they’re stabilizing his neck and taking him to the hospital means he’s possibly seriously injured. Adrenaline can make it so you don’t feel injuries from a crash for some time. Too bad the car didn’t fare nearly as well."
