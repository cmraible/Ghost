<hr>
<p>Due to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/is-covid-19/">COVID-19</a> outbreak, car buyers are getting more used to buying online, and it seems like car enthusiasts, not investors, are in control of growing the market. <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/">Car auctions</a> are on the rise and so are listing vehicles without reserves, even <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1976-porsche-911-s-signature/">rare collector cars</a>.</p>

<p>There have been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/carlisle-auctions-bidding/">auction houses</a> that have exceeded and increased sales, including The Market which is online only. Through the pandemic, they have been upping monthly sales totals and that the no-reserve listings are "becoming an increasingly important part of the classic market". The Market saw its best month to date in July, bringing in £1.26m ($1.665 million U.S. dollars) selling 85 percent of their cars with 77 out of 91 cars. Also, it was the no-reserve deals that showed there was a confidence in the market, meaning that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/muscle-car-birthday/">car enthusiast</a> (not the investor) is keeping the market steady and afloat - if not thriving.</p>
<p>Buyers are more accustomed (if not becoming more accustomed) to bidding online, especially if the car can be seen before making a bid online. </p>
<p>The highest July price came from a '73 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jaguar-e-type-coupe-chip-foose/">Jaguar E-Type</a> roadster that sold for £75,000 (or $99,112.50 U.S. dollars) with an £85,000-90,000 estimate. On top of that, a rare pre-production 1985 Ford Sierra RS Cosworth went for £52,500 ($69,378.75 U.S.) against a £39,000-59,000 estimate. The no-reserve auctions are being driven by buyer confidence increasing. </p>
<p>Ainsley Pierce, The Market's administrator manager said: ‘We’ve seen a slight increase in the number of no-reserve auctions which we offer. This has been driven by increased confidence from sellers in our process and the fact that they have seen consistently strong results from other no-reserve auctions. In fact, such is the success that we now have a dedicated day for no-reserve auctions.</p>
<p>‘Regardless of the whether a given car is valued at £10,000 or £200,000, we would always advise that a no-reserve auction will create a much bigger buzz and will therefore achieve a genuine market value, so we don’t see a ceiling price on no-reserve auctions.’</p>
<p>A rare numbers-matching 1970 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/colorful-plymouth-cuda/">Plymouth 'Cuda</a> (just 1 of 284 built with a four-speed transmission for that model year) will soon be up for bids through the Barrett-Jackson Fall Auction 2020 on October 22 through October 24th. Failing to sell during the July 2020 auction, the car will be up for bids without reserve.</p>
