<p>Of all the classic Mopar <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle cars</a> from back in the day, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-aar-cuda/">Plymouth ‘Cuda AAR</a> is quite possibly the most legendary. The car certainly <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-cuda/">has a wild fan base</a> and it’s easy to understand why with a combination of in-your-face-looks and in-your-face performance. We have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-historic-trans-am-racers-get-flogged-at-sonoma/">SCCA Trans-Am racing</a> to thank for this beauty of a car.</p>

<p>Back in 1970 Plymouth hopped into the Trans-Am races, contracting with Dan Gurney’s All American Racers (AAR) to build cars for competition. Thanks to homologation requirements, a minimum of 2,500 street versions of the car had to be made, and thus the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-aar-cuda/">‘Cuda AAR</a> was born.</p>
<p>Plymouth ended up building 2,724 of the cars in just five weeks and enthusiasts eagerly snatched them up. After all, having a Mopar Trans-Am racer at your disposal was like a dream come true. Because of the limited production numbers, quite a few convincing clone cars have been made over the years, especially as values have skyrocketed. The seller of this car says it’s a real numbers-matching ride.</p>

<p>Painted Lemon Twist (that’s Top Banana for all the Dodge enthusiasts) with black graphics, rear spoiler, and hood, this Plymouth looks correct from bumper to bumper. The car even rolls on Goodyear PolyGlas GT tires. That impeccable restoration was applied to the black interior as well. Everything has been painstakingly restored so this ‘Cuda AAR is drop-dead gorgeous.</p>
<p>Under that hood with the functional scoop is a 340 V8 with Six Pack, a setup which has spawned many stories in the Mopar community. It was professionally rebuilt as part of the restoration. With the engine and air topper painted orange, this car is ready to be parked and shown proudly with the hood up.</p>
