We don’t need more details to reiterate what we’ve said countless times: car theft is bad and getting worse, particularly in areas like Detroit. Hellcats are big targets of criminals in part because they’re fast and fun, plus in part because they seem to be relatively easy to steal. They’re even easier to take at gunpoint, which is a real concern. Staying aware of your surroundings at all times and not letting criminals get the drop on you is your best defense. And remember, sitting in a parked vehicle is actually really dangerous.",
