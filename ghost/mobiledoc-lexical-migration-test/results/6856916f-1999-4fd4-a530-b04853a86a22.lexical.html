<p>The group discusses the filmâ€™s depiction of revolutionary organizing, asking questions like: How is V able to take down the English government all by himself? From where does he get all of his supplies? How did he inspire an entire country to revolt without a comprehensive organizing campaign? And when did he find the time to set up that elaborate domino run? Rivka also points out how Vâ€™s torture and elevation of Evie (Natalie Portman) detracts from what could have been a compelling heroineâ€™s journey.</p>
<p>Rivka and Frank also discuss last weekâ€™s Met Gala, and whether or not itâ€™s possible to attend an elite cultural event while successfully protesting said event.</p>
<p>For next weekâ€™s movie, theyâ€™ll be watching <em>Youâ€™ve Got Mail</em>.</p>
