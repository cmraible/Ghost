<p>When Chevrolet first introduced the Corvette in 1953, all of the cars that year came in a Polo White paint job with a red interior and a black top. Fast forward to 1990, and the <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/4897-atl/1990-chevrolet-corvette-convertible?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious"><strong>1990 Chevrolet Corvette Convertible</strong></a> where this white over red color combination is one of the most popular for that year.</p>

<p>Aside from some of the special edition and low-volume, these were pretty common sports cars, but this particular car is in great condition. The odometer shows just over 66,000 original miles, and while the car shows some minor wear to its white paint and red leather, it wouldn't take much to get this Corvette back to excellent condition. The underside of the car is evidence of how well this car has been treated, and the soft top shows no signs of wear or damage.</p>
<p>The 1990 model year was a bit of a transitional year for the C4 Corvette. Not only was it the final year of the angled rear end before the 1991 model year added a rounder rump, but it was also the first year of the legendary ZR-1. While that car used the powerful 335-horsepower LT5 V-8 and a six-speed manual gearbox, this car used the Corvette's base 5.7-liter V-8 with its 250-horsepower output backed with a four-speed automatic transmission.</p>
