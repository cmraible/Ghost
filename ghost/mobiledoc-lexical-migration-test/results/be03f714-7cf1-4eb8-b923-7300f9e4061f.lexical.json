            "text": "Ford has made a name for itself for always being on the front line when it comes to American automotive tech. From the very first Model-T which pioneered the idea of mass production and showed the utility of the assembly line to the world of American manufacturing, to current-generation cars such as the Mustang. Ford sets an example for others to try and follow. Of course, competition is fierce and for the company that has become synonymous with the phrase “Fix Or Repair Daily '' it can be quite easy to forget the storied past of this, now world-famous, automotive giant. However, this car brings back memories of where Ford came from. Starting life as a regular old T-Bucket and eventually being transformed into a drag strip dominating beast, this thing is fantastic.",
