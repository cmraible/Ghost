As you can see at the end of the video, the Corvette is trying to turn around, but it doesn’t turn a tight-enough circle, so the driver has to reverse and crank the wheel more. That’s an especially dangerous position to be in since the car is blocking both lanes and could be broadsided by another vehicle traveling in either direction."
