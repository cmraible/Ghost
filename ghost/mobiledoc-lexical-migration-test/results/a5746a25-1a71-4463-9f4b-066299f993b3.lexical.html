<p>On this week’s bonus episode of <em>Lever Time Premium</em>, exclusively for <em>The Lever</em>’s supporting subscribers: We’re sharing two separate interviews that cover everything you need to know about the evils of the private equity industry.</p>
<p>In the first interview, David interviews federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou about his new book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/brendan-ballou/plunder/9781541702103/?lens=publicaffairs"><em>Plunder: Private Equity's Plan to Pillage America</em></a>. Brendan, who served as special counsel for private equity in the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, explains how the enforcement of private equity works — and how it could be better.</p>
<p>David also speaks with Joshua Rosner, co-author of <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/These-Are-the-Plunderers/Gretchen-Morgenson/9781982191283"><em>These Are the Plunderers: How Private Equity Runs — And Wrecks — America</em></a>, which covers the past 30 years of private equity’s history and how it’s become such a dominant — and destructive — force in the American economy.</p>
