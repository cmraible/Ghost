<h3 id="dear-left-wondering">Dear Left Wondering,</h3>
<p>I’ve read that consuming protein from insect powder instead of eating livestock could help reduce global warming. At the same time, I’ve read that global warming is causing a significant reduction in insect populations. That really bugs me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>With population growth <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362278870_Insects_as_a_Viable_and_Sustainable_Protein_and_Food_Source_for_Human_Consumption">predicted to surpass</a> current food production by 2050, quandaries about how we should sustain ourselves will become all the more pressing. So what better place to start than by trying to answer the question: Is it ethical to eat insects, or could doing so exacerbate the mass extinction of bugs?</p>
<p>Entomophagy, or the consumption of insects as food, can be a protein-rich alternative to livestock meat, and might actually generate more health benefits. Of the <a href="https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb4094en">more than 2,000</a> species of edible insects worldwide, at least three — crickets, honey bees, and mealworms — have similar or better <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33397123/">nutritional value</a> than beef and chicken.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>Beyond the health benefits, edible insects could help combat climate change, given animal agriculture’s role as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/left-wondering-the-carnivores-dilemma/">second largest contributor</a> to global warming after fossil fuels. That’s because insects are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27731991">less resource-intensive</a> to produce than livestock meat, and produce <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526541/">less greenhouse emissions</a> when cultivated and processed into food. That said, large-scale insect farming — which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/bugs-are-safe-for-europeans-to-eat-as-nestle-cargill-tap-farms#xj4y7vzkg">predicted to grow tenfold by 2025</a> — presents ethical terra incognita worth exploring.</p>
<p>Many cultures worldwide, particularly in the global south, have long recognized the health benefits of eating insects and made them a dietary staple. While many of us in the U.S. and Europe have yet to overcome their squeamish psychological response to the prospect of eating bugs, Thai people are chomping on <a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/hon-mhai">hon mhai</a>, a protein-rich dish made from deep-fried and seasoned silk worms, and sub-saharan Africans are crushing up <a href="https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0137-z">termites</a> to use as a grain substitute. There’s even a <a href="https://www.bugsfeed.com/kushihara_wasp_festival">Kushihara wasp-eating festival</a> in Japan.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>On a personal note, I tried ants as a kid after being told they were rich in protein (the fact that the critters were entering our house through a crack in our wall made my experiment quite convenient). A couple decades later, I sampled cricket powder-based crackers at a conference. I can confidently say neither of those experiences scarred me.</p>
<p>But here’s the rub: Global warming is already ravaging <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/02/24/1082752634/the-insect-crisis-oliver-milman">hundreds of thousands</a> of insect species, including some of the critters <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/11/18220082/insects-extinction-bological-conservation">best suited</a> for human consumption. So as entomophagy expands, we will have to make sure we don’t exacerbate the depopulation problem, especially since the vast majority of edible insect species are currently collected <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opag-2020-0206/html?lang=en">directly from the wild</a>, rather than specially reared for consumption.</p>
<p>And while most existing insect farming operations are smaller and may be more mindful of the environmental impacts of their efforts, as demand increases, larger-scale operations might deprioritize such considerations, such as how we have manipulated animal life cycles for mass meat production.</p>
<p>The hope, therefore, is to find ways to sustainably cultivate large insect populations, in order to help address the climate changes that are putting insects on the brink of extinction.</p>
<p>However, maybe we should also consider what the bugs themselves think about all of this. Currently, the evidence is mixed as to whether insects feel pleasure and pain to the extent of larger creatures (for example, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-torment-of-insect-minds-and-our-moral-duty-not-to-farm-them">limited research</a> has shown that some insects can become depressed). But it might behoove us to shift our mindset about the potential sentience of bugs, so that we can create farming practices and regulatory frameworks that reflect some level of compassion towards them.</p>
<p>For example, New York University bioethics professor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/how-should-we-treat-insects/14091824">Jeff Sebo</a><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-torment-of-insect-minds-and-our-moral-duty-not-to-farm-them">argues</a> that we shouldn’t be farming bugs until we fully explore the ethics of such efforts, and examine insects’ moral status.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the fact that insects might never be considered a true alternative to animal meat, and that instead they will mostly continue to be used to prop up traditional livestock agriculture through their use as feed. As the authors of a <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-torment-of-insect-minds-and-our-moral-duty-not-to-farm-them">recent <em>Aeon </em>essay</a> on the ethics of insect farming put it, “Plant-based supply chains — including for plant-based meats — are generally much more sustainable than the animal-based supply chains to which insect farms are contributing.”</p>
<p>Ultimately then, the question of what sort of protein we should be eating comes down to harm reduction, rather than attempting to eliminate harm altogether. If saving the planet and respecting living beings is paramount for you, then a plant-based diet is likely the way to go — especially since such foods are increasingly tasting much like livestock byproducts. After that, folks might want to consider entomophagy rather than eating animal meat, or at least reduce their reliance on animal agriculture, as well as seek out small-scale, locally bred meat options (that is, if you can afford it).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ll continue getting comfortable with the idea of entomophagy, perhaps by contemplating a <em>Snowpiercer</em>-esque future in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZo2mbbCmKQ">cockroach protein bars</a> are the norm...</p>

<p>I have a 401(k) set up through my employer, and am wondering if I'm able to request that my administrator not invest my money in certain types of companies (fossil fuels, union busting companies etc.). If so, what types of industries and companies would you recommend I ask to be removed from my portfolio (looking at you, Amazon)?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Conscious Investor</p>

<h3 id="dear-conscious-investor">Dear Conscious Investor,</h3>
<p>As consumers, we don’t have as much ability as we’d want to stop harmful industries from hurting people, workers, and the environment. That said, what little power we do have we should absolutely use, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-aarp-research-nearly-half-of-americans-do-not-have-access-to-retirement-plans-at-work-301585809.html">if you’re fortunate enough</a> to work for an employer that offers a retirement savings plan, one way to do so is by trying to ensure your dollars are invested in companies that share your values — and not in oil and gas companies and corporate giants like Amazon that have abysmal labor practices.</p>
<p>And now that larger institutions like universities and state governments have increasingly joined the fossil fuel divestment movement, individuals can try wielding that same type of power via their workplace 401(k)s. But it’s easier said than done.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://401kspecialistmag.com/401k-participants-largely-pass-on-esg-options-research-finds/">recent study</a> found that even when sustainable investing options like environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds were offered in 401(k) plans, less than 10 percent of investors chose to allocate their money to such options. And when investors <em>did</em> opt for an ESG fund, such investments typically made up less than 20 percent of their total portfolio. This might in part be because it requires more effort for the employee to build their own 401(k) portfolios, rather than just defaulting to, say, a company’s low-effort, target-date fund.</p>

<p>I recently experienced this very dilemma when I tried to move the funds I’d accumulated from past employers to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), since my current employer doesn’t currently offer a retirement benefit. When I asked my retirement planning company about investing my dollars in value-aligned companies, the specialist assisting me hesitated, then explained that I’d have to do significant research of the hundreds of options available to find companies that don’t run counter to my beliefs — a project that he said would be “extremely hard to pull off.”</p>
<p>Considering the amount of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/blackrocks-stealth-anti-climate-agenda/">greenwashing bullshit</a> many of these investment companies put out and my lack of experience in portfolio management, I was sufficiently scared off and went with the less labor-intensive option.</p>
<p>If there were services that offered more hand-holding and education on the matter, socially conscious investing might become more common. But even if you’re getting the help needed to make informed decisions, the harsh reality is that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/401-k-s-could-become-even-less-welcoming-to-esg-funds-11601840714">options are severely limited</a> for those who want to morally invest. That’s because under capitalism, the bottom line wins the day.</p>
<p>But here’s at least one place to start: Use this free <a href="https://fossilfreefunds.org/">online tool</a>, run by corporate accountability group As You Sow, to check if any of your savings are tied up in fossil fuels. If they are, which is <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3059618/how-to-convince-your-employer-to-divest-your-401k-from-fossil-fuels">likely</a>, you can visit your retirement fund’s online portal and try to make adjustments that are more environmentally friendly. Tools like <a href="https://www.sustainalytics.com/">Sustainalytics</a> can help evaluate the environmental and social impact of various companies.</p>
<p>Even if there are no options for green investing within your 401(k), you have every right to ask your employer to do better. It’s worth remembering that there is strength in numbers, so enlist the support of your like-minded colleagues. And the smaller the organization you work at, the better <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epd3vj/how-to-invest-your-401k-in-green-initiatives-that-dont-screw-over-your-kids">your chances</a> of success.
