<p>The past few weeks have seen communities, trapped in varous degrees of lockdown, need to organise themselves more than every before. In most places, that's centred around Facebook groups, or WhatsApp chats.</p>
<p>But one newspaper has made an effort to become the hub for its city:</p>

<p>Now, just imagine they continue to take that community-centric role <em>after</em> the crisis has passed…</p>
<h2 id="flickr-revamps-its-groups-admin">Flickr revamps its groups admin</h2>
<p>Remember Flickr? It was the hot thing in online photo sharing before Instagram came along. Under new owners SmugMug, it's been undergoing something of a renaissance. </p>
<p>We used to use Flickr as an excellent way of building community around user-generated news photos. Maybe now is the time to revisit that idea?</p>

<h2 id="linkedin-soups-up-its-pages">LinkedIn soups up its Pages</h2>
<p>Three key changes for LinkedIn Pages: </p>
<ul>
    <li>You can invite people to follow pages</li>
    <li>You can stream to your page with LinkedIn Live</li>
    <li>You can choose to post to the page as an individual or a organisation</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks promising - it could well make the pages more useful as a voice of both the company and the individuals within it. </p>

<p>Like everyone else, I've been working extensively over Zoom. I'm using it for the online versions of my courses. My daughter used it earlier to catch up with her primary school friends. </p>
<p>But there are some <em>serious </em>problems with its security. </p>
