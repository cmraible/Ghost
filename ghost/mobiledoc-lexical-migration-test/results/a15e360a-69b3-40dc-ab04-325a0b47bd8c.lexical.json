Of course, that all changed when the coronavirus pandemic started spreading across the globe like a raging wildfire fueled by gasoline. Everyone was issued to stay at home in hopes of stopping the virus from spreading even more. Social distancing is our new norm. Since we became aware of it a couple months ago, businesses have shut down, people have lost jobs, kids are being taught virtually at home, and we are ordered to stay at least 6 feet away from one another at all times. While times are tough no matter where you look moment, here is a feel-good story that involves a private car collector that is selling a chunk of their collection to help those affected by COVID-19. From old-school rare American muscle to high-end exotics, 7 cars from the Ash Crest Collection are up for grabs with all proceeds to benefit families and small businesses affected by the pandemic.",
