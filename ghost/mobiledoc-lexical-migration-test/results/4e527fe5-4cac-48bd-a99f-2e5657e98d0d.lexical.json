That’s well ahead of the 1.18 million links to <em>instagram.com</em> that Topsy counted in the same 24 hours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/?attachment_id=25056\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-25056\"><img class=\" wp-image-25056 aligncenter\" alt=\"Vine vs Instagram\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-20-at-12.22.20-PM.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-20-at-12.22.20-PM.png 886w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-20-at-12.22.20-PM-300x147.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Vine has gained in popularity because users can be more creative and portray more in a short video than they can with a picture or through a few sentences on Facebook or Twitter.  Videos can also be easily taken by a smartphone or tablet, and users say sharing on Vine is quicker than uploading video to YouTube.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"></div>\n"
