When the first film came out it was shocking and exposed people to the underground street racing culture, but they don’t feature street racing at all in the newer movies for legal reasons and to make it more appealing to a wider audience.

After all, just about every major automaker is talking fast and furiously about electrification as the EU and other governments threaten to kill the internal combustion engine."
