Suspension components consist of coilovers up front, a Total Control rear coilover system, and Total Control front and rear sway bars. For easy steering, a power rack and pinion steering system is also installed. Bringing everything to a halt are 6-piston Wilwood calipers that work with slotted and cross-drilled rotors all around. Depending on driving style and use, an adjustable rear proportioning valve gives the driver utmost control over brake bias by allowing them to match their settings. The \"Hitman\" is also equipped with a BeCool aluminum crossflow radiator with dual electric cooling fans  to keep temperatures in check and ensure everything runs smoothly. "
