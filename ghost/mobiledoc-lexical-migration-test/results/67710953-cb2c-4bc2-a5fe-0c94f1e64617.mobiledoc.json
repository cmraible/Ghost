And while that nice blanket of dust might seem to be preserving the paint, a nice car cover would do a much better job."

He at first said he wasn’t going to diagnose anything, but then he caves and does a few simple things to see if he can figure out why the different cars won’t fire up. Basically, the video is a testament to why if you are going to store a car you should put stabilizing fluids in and take some other steps to truly preserve it, otherwise getting everything running later will be difficult."
