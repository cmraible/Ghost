The ultra-rare Porsche was highly desired as it went up for auction with a starting bid of $30 million, a starting price that shocked bidders considering that it was only expected to sell for $20 million. The desire for the car outweighed the price, and the bidding war eventually reached $70 million. However, the auction house made a mistake, and the bid went back down to $17 million instead which caused mass confusion among potential buyers. Many people booed and walked out, and the car did not reach its reserve price. The car never sold or exchanged hands. If they had kept the $70 million bid, it would have been the most expensive car to sell at auction by a staggering $20 million."

Stuffed with a 427cui GT40 engine, this Shelby GT500 broke the public price record for any Ford Mustang. The plan was to produce a limited run of 50 cars, but due to the cost of the project, it was abandoned leaving this example as the only one in existence. Sent to Dallas, the car was sold to James Hadden and James Gormon, who modified the gearbox for drag racing. Back in 1970, the car was purchased by Bobby Pierce of Texas who held onto the car for 25 years. After that, the car was sent to Florida where it changed hands a few times before it was purchased by a collector who lightly restored the car. Shelby collector John Wickey had previously owned the car, and he found it in his hands again."

One of those vehicles was the well-known 1973 Lincoln Continental limousine that was often spotted driving around Memphis, Tennessee, with Elvis onboard. One famous photograph of Elvis is of him behind the wheel of this exact limo while stopped for a car accident. The white-on-white limo sold for $75,600. Other cars in his collection that also crossed the auction stage was his fully restored 1967 GMC C10 farm truck that went for $30,000 and a 1974 Rupp Centaur three-wheeled motorcycle that was documented in CMT's \"Raiders of Rock\" series in 2013 that sold for $23,000."

Some were just shells of a car that once was, and others appeared ready to hit the car show circuit. Other notable cars in the collection included a 1970 Chevelle SS 454 Tribute, a 1968 Dodge Charger, a '78 Trans AM, and a '64 Chevy Malibu SS."

          "A large collection of vehicles were seized from Jeff and Paulette Carpoff, who were arrested for running a Ponzi scheme. The cars taken by U.S. Marshals ranged from regular run-of-the-mill vehicles to hot rods, sports cars, luxury cars, dirt bikes, and even a motorhome. One car that stood out from the crowd is this 2007 Shelby Mustang that went for a staggering $1 million, and it has an interesting story behind it. Just weeks after the Las Vegas mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, this car crossed the auction block to help raise money for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's injured officers. What makes this Super Snake even more unique is that is sports VIN xxx007, the seventh one built after the namesake's rebirth in 2007. This specific Shelby was also owned by Ford's previous CEO, Mark Fields, and it sold this time for over $167k. Other cars worth noting include a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon, 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle Pro-Street, 2002 Dodge Viper RT/10, 1993 AM General pickup, 2014 Fiat 500, 2014 Jaguar XKR-S GT, 1968 Plymouth GTX Hemi, and a 2017 Cadillac CTS-V."
