<p>“Y’all almost had Cynthia Nixon. This is why experience matters.” — CNN political analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/bakari_sellers/status/1239929643760836609?lang=en">Bakari Sellers</a> in March 2020 talking about New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic as it began to take hold in New York City, before the governor became inundated with scandal.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/8-million-americans-slipped-poverty-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-new-study-n1243762">8 million Americans</a> fell into poverty during the pandemic, America’s 657 billionaires have grown their wealth by $1.3 trillion, or <a href="https://twitter.com/4taxfairness/status/1370018735474540544?s=11">44 percent</a>, in the last year, according to the nonprofit Americans For Tax Fairness. That’s enough <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/10/what-is-in-the-stimulus/">revenue</a> to single-handedly pay for two-thirds of the new COVID-19 relief bill. A stunning 43 new billionaires have been created in that same time period. The gains among the nation’s richest come as the country has experienced more than 535,000 COVID-19 deaths and 78 million jobs lost amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, who has expressed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/biden-eyes-first-major-tax-hike-since-1993-in-next-economic-plan">hostility</a> to the idea of a wealth tax, is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/biden-eyes-first-major-tax-hike-since-1993-in-next-economic-plan">eyeing</a> a series of tax hikes, including raising the capital gains tax rate for those earning $1 million or more annually, expanding the reach of the estate tax, and raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from where it sits today at flat rate of 21 percent — the result of Donald Trump’s 2017 tax reform. Prior to that legislation, the corporate tax rate was divided into tiers from as low as 15 percent to a high of 39 percent.</p>

<p>Richmond Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2021/eb_21-07">research finds</a> that first-time incarceration can decrease men's lifetime earnings up to 50 percent. Incarceration also can increase the number of years spent unemployed or out of the labor force by as many as four years.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-flashback-"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>In February 2016, Barack Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/23/remarks-president-plan-close-prison-guantanamo-bay">announced</a> a plan to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Speaking from the White House, the President said the facility undermined national security, drained military resources, and harmed America’s partnerships with foreign nations. Currently, Guantanamo Bay remains open. The Biden administration is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/12/967480526/biden-administration-aims-to-close-guantanamo-bay-prison">reportedly looking to close it</a>.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p>• <strong>WHITE HOUSE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: </strong>The Biden administration hasn’t yet made top White House staffers’ financial disclosures publicly available yet and has not provided the documents to individual requesters, either. A White House spokesperson tells <em>The Daily Poster</em> that people will be able to request the disclosure forms on whitehouse.gov starting on Friday (Hat tip to The Revolving Door Project for the info.)</p>
<p>• <strong>BIDEN CONTINUES BACKING YEMEN DESTRUCTION: </strong>Biden has promised to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war on Yemen, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-end-support-saudi-offenseive-yemen-b68f58493dbfc530b9fcfdb80a13098f">announced</a> last month that the U.S. would no longer back the Kingdom’s “offensive” operations. The administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/04/us-end-support-saudi-led-operations-yemen-humanitarian-crisis">clarified</a> that it would still support “defensive” operations in the country. According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2021/03/10/tl-nima-dnt-live-jake-tapper.cnn">CNN</a>, Saudi Arabia is still enforcing its blockade of the country, and has refused to allow supplies into the country’s principal port for the past two months, in violation of a UN agreement. Roughly 16 million Yemenis — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-sanaa-famine-david-beasley-philanthropy-9de48557737362bbe9e1c3f05dcbca89">about half the population</a> — currently face food insecurity, and as many as 400,000 children are at risk of death due to fuel and food shortages. The Biden administration’s new envoy to Yemen has <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1370067699196387332?s=20">denied</a> that the blockade is still in effect.</p>
<p>• <strong>DEMOCRATS IGNORE TRUMP RULE CHANGES</strong>: Despite having the power to roll back Trump-era rules, Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/15/democrats-trump-regulations-476162">are not acting</a>. The Congressional Review Act allows a congressional majority to nullify last-minute regulations passed by the prior president without the threat of a Senate filibuster, as long as they are annulled within 60 legislative days. Democrats’ inaction has so far allowed Trump’s last-minute environmental deregulations to stand, including an effort to roll back rules regulating methane emissions, as the 60-day review deadlines approach.</p>
<p>• <strong>DEB HAALAND MAKES HISTORY AS INTERIOR SECRETARY: </strong>The first ever Native American cabinet secretary has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/15/977558590/deb-haaland-confirmed-as-first-native-american-interior-secretary">confirmed</a> to lead the Interior Department. Progressives lauded Biden’s nomination of Haaland, an advocate of the Green New Deal.</p>
<p>• <strong>PFIZER PLANS BIG PROFITS OFF VACCINE: </strong>Speaking to investors, Pfizer CFO Frank D'Amelio <a href="https://twitter.com/lhfang/status/1371593036166090755">explained</a> that people may require a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine along with yearly boosters. They suggested that the possibility of the virus becoming endemic presented “a significant opportunity for our vaccine from a demand perspective, from a pricing perspective.” Meanwhile, <em>The Intercept </em>has reported that Pfizer’s lobbyists are <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/03/vaccine-coronavirus-big-pharma-biden/">pushing</a> the Biden administration to sanction countries like Colombia and Chile for attempting to ramp up vaccine production without permission from pharmaceutical companies.</p>
