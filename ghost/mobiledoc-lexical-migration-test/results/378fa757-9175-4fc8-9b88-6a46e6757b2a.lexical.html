<p>Giphy wants to <a href="https://medium.com/@giphy/introducing-gif-view-counts-e3ec1899e7bd">tell you how dank</a><sup id="fnref-37053-1"><a href="#fn-37053-1">1</a></sup> your memes are:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>You can see view counts for every GIF from an official Artist or Partner. When you visit an official Artist or Partner’s Channel, you can now also see how many GIFs are available and what the cumulative GIF view count is for the channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, so long as you are an official artist or partner.</p>
<p>Fascinating how central Gifs have become to some forms of online discourse.</p>
