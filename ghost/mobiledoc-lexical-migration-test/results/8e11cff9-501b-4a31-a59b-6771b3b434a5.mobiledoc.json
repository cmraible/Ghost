It’s a fairly clever design; the entire top folds and stows, completely disappearing behind the seats, which makes for a much cleaner look with the top down."

Last year I inspected over a dozen cars for clients who had ordered a PPI from another inspection firm and were  disappointed with the amount of information provided in the inspection. Several clients also complained of difficulty getting the inspection scheduled and completed as well."

With classic cars trading hands at ever increasing prices, it’s easy to make a mistake that can cost you thousands of dollars when buying sight unseen."
