          "While this car clearly started life as a Chevrolet Camaro convertible, it has been given the treatment to resemble a modern Trans Am and could possibly resemble one if the car was still produced. Finished in black and gold just like the famous vintage movie car, this Pontiac is sure to turn some heads along with being an interesting conversation piece. This one also features a tan power convertible top that is perfect for those warm, sunny days. The hood is adorned with the gold screaming chicken with a cutout for the shaker, and Trans Am logos can be found on the rear and on the fenders. Open the doors or lower the top to reveal an attractive two-tone interior in tan and gold. Under the hood looks to be a 6.2-liter V8 engine from a Camaro SS with a K&N cold air kit and a functional hood scoop."

An easier route for anyone wanting to create their own that Trans Am appearance is to install a full bolt-on body kit by ZTA. Each one will make that car look like it is ready to help bootleg some beer over state lines with a cop in hot pursuit. "
