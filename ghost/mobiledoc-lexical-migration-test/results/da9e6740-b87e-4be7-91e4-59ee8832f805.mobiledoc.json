          ", the pioneering aviator known for her record-breaking flights, also had an equally daring taste in automobiles. Known for her exceptional spirit and forward-thinking, it's no surprise that she owned a 1936 Cord 810, a car as innovative and revolutionary as Earhart herself."

          "The Cord 810, unveiled at the 1935 New York Auto Show, was a marvel of automotive technology. Its revolutionary design, with a \"coffin-nose\" hood, hidden headlights, and an absence of running boards, reflected a break from the past and a daring step towards the future. The car was equipped with a V-8 Lycoming engine, delivering 125 horsepower, and an innovative pre-selector transmission system, qualities that appealed to a risk-taker like Earhart."

          "Amelia Earhart's Cord 810 was a Westchester Sedan model, finished in a light hue popularly referred to as \"Earhart Red\". It was equipped with front-wheel drive, another progressive feature that appealed to Earhart's adventurous spirit. This car symbolized her fearless and pioneering nature, making it not just an automobile, but a piece of history embodying her character and values."

          "Unfortunately, Earhart disappeared during her attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 1937, less than a year after she bought the Cord. Her car, however, lived on and has been carefully preserved. It underwent a complete restoration in 1989, and meticulous efforts were made to keep it as original as possible. The result is a beautifully preserved car that stands as a testament to Earhart's daring spirit and love for innovation."

          "Interestingly, the Cord was not the only car Earhart owned. She also had a yellow Kissel \"Gold Bug\" Speedster, which she dubbed the \"Yellow Peril\". It is clear that she had a keen interest in cars that were technologically advanced and reflected her bold personality."
