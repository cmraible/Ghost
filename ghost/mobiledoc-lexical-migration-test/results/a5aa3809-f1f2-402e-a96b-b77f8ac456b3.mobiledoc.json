          "There’s no denying how handsome this classic ride looks with the smooth dark blue paint. It makes the wide whitewall tires really stand out. The front grille, headlight housings, hubcaps, and other brightwork is polished nicely, emphasizing this is a luxurious set of wheels. A nice black convertible top helps complete the exterior look, staying true to the vehicle’s roots. This particular car went through a professional restoration process back in the 1980s and has been well cared-for since. The convertible top was replaced in 2015."

The 903 Victoria Super Eight was one of the most upscale cars in the Packard lineup. Adding further to the collectability of this Super Eight is the fact it’s the only one documented to have been manufactured in Canada. This car has won three national firsts since it was restored, plus it was on the cover of the July 2016 Classic Car Club of America Bulletin and featured in an article inside."
