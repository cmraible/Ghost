<p>Voldrake has a lot of firepower… literally. Be careful of his fire attacks and try not to stay too close to his head. That doesn’t mean not to attack it, but keep moving and try to keep your distance when he looks like he’s ready to breathe some fire your way. When Voldrake starts to breath deeply through his nose, that means he’s going to send a sweeping line of fire or a single fireball your way and the best way to avoid it is to dash to the other side.</p>

<p>Once you’ve attack Voldrake’s head enough, he’ll go into a dazed state…</p>

<p>When this happens, either line up his head with one of the three stalactites on the ceiling or dash into the side of his head so that it hits the spikes on the wall when his head is close to one.</p>

<p>Once you do that, he’ll retreat into the background and lock onto you. When the aimer turns red, that means he’s locked onto the spot. Your best way to avoid this is to stand on top of the massive stalactite that comes down and as soon as the aimer turns red, dash away. You’ll know where the massive stalactite is as it always appears on the side that you smashed Voldrake’s head into.</p>

<p>Voldrake will also send some waves of lava your way for you to avoid that change each time. The first order is middle and then one on the left and right; the second is right, middle, left, middle, right; the third is left, right, left but slightly bigger; and the fourth is two on the outside, one on the inside, outside, inside, outside, inside.</p>

<p>Smash his head on all five spikes and he’ll be defeated. You’ll then gain the Dragon Orb and Prof. Leveratt will give you the Dragon Talisman. Now you can fly and breathe fire… awesome!</p>
<p>You’ll then be thrown into a side-scrolling SHMUP-like section where you’ll need to dodge projectiles, kill enemies and make it to the end… you know, like a SHMUP.</p>

<p>Go all the way until you’re in the water and continue fighting enemies down there… because fire works in water in Monster World.</p>
<p>After you mow down a few hordes of enemies, you’ll now have another boss fight on your hands against…</p>
<h3>Masquerade Carp</h3>
<p>I really don’t feel like I need to explain this one (which is why I put it in with Voldrake). Basically, it’s a SHMUP boss fight. Just be wary of his big laser beam which you’ll tell that he’s charging up for when he looks like this…</p>

<p>When Masquerade Carp uses its laser, it’ll start from either the bottom or the top and it’ll move across two-thirds of the area. So make sure to fly (swim) all the way to the other side. Keep at it and you’ll eventually win.</p>
