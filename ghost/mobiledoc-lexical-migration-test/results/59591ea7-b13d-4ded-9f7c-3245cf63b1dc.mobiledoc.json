Even worse was a reportedly stolen Monaro crashing into two parked cars in the southern part of Sydney, Australia back in August. We would call this a real disaster Down Under."

Steam pours out from under the crumpled hood and if we had to guess, we’d say the frame is less than straight at this point. It looked so beautiful with nice glossy red paint and nice wheels, but someone’s pride and joy was stolen and wrecked by some royal jerks."

At least the vehicle that was flipped onto its side wasn’t some huge loss, it was just some Hyundai, from the looks of it a crossover, and there are too many of those in the world, so whatever."
