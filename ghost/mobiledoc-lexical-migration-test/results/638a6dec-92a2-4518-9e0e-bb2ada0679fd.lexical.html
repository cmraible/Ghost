<p>Cops love donuts, don’t let anyone tell you differently, but they even have their limits. That limit for the Antioch Police Department in California was when a guy in a white Chevy Camaro decided to turn some subpar examples out in the Marina parking lot. Not only did he fail to really produce the goods, like a true amateur he crashed his muscle car into one of the light poles. But wait, it gets even worse.</p>

<p>You might get a citation for doing donuts in a parking lot, but it’s even worse if you subsequently crash your ride, then try fleeing the scene of the accident. That’s right, police say the driver did just that, but they’d already received a call about the attempted smoking of rear tires (emphasis on “attempted”) plus the whole thing was caught on the rather clear surveillance video. This guy was going to get away with nothing.</p>

<p>With cops already approaching, this genius smooth criminal didn’t get far since he was hoofing it. If the car wasn’t stolen, which there’s no mention of that, we’re not sure what he thought he was going to get away with by slinking away like that. Was he planning on reporting it stolen, then acting all shocked when the cops told him someone who couldn’t do any decent donuts crashed it?</p>
<p>Well, the guy did receive an important lesson about why you don’t flee the scene of an accident. He also got to wear some shiny bracelets and ride in the back of a police car. Now he’s facing a reckless driving charge and his Camaro has been impounded for 30 days, which comes with a nice big fine at the end, so that’s fun.</p>

<p>It’s possible this guy was practicing so he could be the next star at the local street takeover. The Antioch Police Department seems to feel that was the objective, because in the Facebook post about the accident there’s a nice lecture about not participating in “sideshows” or street takeovers, which some believe originated in the Bay Area. A lot of morons who do participate in them wreck their cars like this guy, plus people get hurt.</p>
