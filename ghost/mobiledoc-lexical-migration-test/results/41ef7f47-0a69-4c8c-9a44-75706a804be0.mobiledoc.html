<p>Under an operation called <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/toronto-police-bust-gang/">Project Stallion</a>, Toronto Police were able to seize 556 stolen cars and arrest 119 individuals. It started with an investigation launched in November 2022 and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/canadian-police-10-million/">the trap was sprung</a> closed on April 11 with the estimated net worth of the vehicles seized at $27 million CAD.</p>

<p>At a news conference where the bust was announced, Toronto Police Chief Myron Demkiw said the department busted down numerous car theft “cells” and would make many more arrests in the coming days. “As a Service, we are committed to the safety and well-being of our residents above all else,” he added.</p>
<p>With the car theft rate in Toronto doubling versus what it was in 2019, police have their work cut out for them. For example, Superintendent Ron Taverner points out that in just two divisions of the Greater Toronto Area nearly 2,000 cars and 300 catalytic converters were swiped during 2022. The area has become one of the top hunting grounds for thieves in Canada, with stolen vehicles often shipped overseas to be resold.</p>
<p>Even more concerning is the growing trend of carjackings as thieves become bolder. And car theft rings are involved in other crimes, many of them violent in nature, making busting them a big priority for law enforcement. It sounds like police in Toronto and other parts of Canada mean business about nipping theft trends before they grow further.</p>
<p>Canadian authorities have made a few fairly large car theft ring busts lately, but none that would likely stem the crimewave in the country. We don’t know if this latest operation will turn things around, but it would be great if it did. However, people need to remain vigilant and take precautions to protect their vehicles and themselves.</p>
