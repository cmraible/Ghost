          "The term “barn find” has been abused quite a bit lately. While it originally referred to cars hidden away from scrap metal mandates during wartime, then forgotten about in a dusty old barn only to be discovered decades later, now it’s used for all sorts of classic cars. We’ve seen pretty pristine garage-kept vehicles referred to as “barn finds” and we know it annoys a lot of enthusiasts. Well, today we have a whole collection of real "

He shows off the old road which leads to the location, and it’s completely overgrown to the point you would be forgiven for not realizing there ever was a road there. This is when you know you’ll be seeing some amazing cars preserved as well as the barn can keep them sheltered from the elements, not some staged scene where some guys sprinkled an immaculate ride with some fake barn dust for the cameras."

Still, many of the rides which have been forgotten about for at least a good couple of decades if not more like three are impressive, including a Rolls-Royce, Jaguars, BMWs, MGs, Volkswagens, and more.
