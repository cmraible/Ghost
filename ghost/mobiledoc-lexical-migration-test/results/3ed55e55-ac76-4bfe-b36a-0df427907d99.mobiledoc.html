<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota-"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This past week was a long year. I don’t know about you, but I’m mentally exhausted from it all. Yes, I am relieved that Trump is on his way out, but mostly I feel overwhelmed and tired — and the worst part is, we all know that money never sleeps, so if we take a rest, then nothing will fundamentally change. Indeed, these next few weeks and months could determine the next few years.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that we are in for a rough winter — the pandemic will likely get worse, Trump will probably try to do damage on his way out of office and we’re all suffering from a form of mass PTSD from the year we’ve experienced. But I still remain optimistic that 2020 could be a year that catalyzes positive change.</p>
<p>Think about it; even as we’ve been quarantined and socially isolated, this has been a year of collective experience like few others. In many years, we are going through our own lives, doing our own thing. But this year, we’ve all gone through a pandemic, a national election and a climate crisis that has touched every corner of the country.</p>
<p>Every person in America has been touched by these things — and so while we may feel particularly polarized and divided, I think there’s a chance that these collective experiences have reminded us that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s me being overly optimistic or unrealistic, because sure, there is an entire media misinformation machine designed to continue ripping us apart and isolating us in our own news bubbles. But I think the experiences have been so powerful and formative that they will have a lasting effect — and I think we may look back on this year as a time when we realized that our lives are all intertwined, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, I published a book called <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/168043/the-uprising-by-david-sirota/">The Uprising</a> — which was about how politics was becoming a competition between progressives and conservatives to try to harness populist anger at an economic system that has turned America into a feudalism. The book proved to be prescient — and I think we are once again at such a turning point, with a moment of opportunity.</p>
<p>We’re trying to do our part here at The Daily Poster to try to make sure that opportunity is seized — and we couldn’t do it without your support. The stakes are high: Whether or not we as a society seize this opportunity will determine the future of the country and the planet.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
