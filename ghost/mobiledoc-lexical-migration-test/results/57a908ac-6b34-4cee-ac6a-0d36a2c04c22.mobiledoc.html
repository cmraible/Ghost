<p>In the wake of the devastating recent Supreme Court decisions, we sprang into action to tell the tale of how this terrible moment came to be. The result is our brand-new 135-page e-book, <em>John Roberts’ Revolution</em>.</p>
<p>In the first of our new <em>Lever Reader</em> e-book series, we reveal point by point how a court led by a celebrated “moderate” like John Roberts has become the most extreme in a century — and explore what the effects of these rulings are likely to have nationwide.</p>

<p>Once you take the deal, you’ll be sent an email with access to <strong>both</strong> of our current e-books: <em>John Roberts’ Revolution</em> and our <em>Citizens’ Guide to Following the Money and Holding the Powerful Accountable</em>. You’ll have immediate access as we release more e-books. You can download them and read them at your convenience or read them on the e-reader of your choice.</p>
<p>Once again, for a very limited time, you can get full membership, including these books, for only <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/3RxzInR">$4 per month</a></strong>. That’s a lot less than you’d pay for two books on their own, but you’ll also get other exclusive content, our premium podcast, access to supporter-only live events, and more.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and for being a reader of <em>The Lever</em>. We do this work so that you can be a more informed citizen during these difficult times.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
