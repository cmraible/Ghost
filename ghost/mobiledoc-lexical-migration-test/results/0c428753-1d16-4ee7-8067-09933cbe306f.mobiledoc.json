Since it’s new, the Grigio Telestro has a glass-like finish while the Black stripes are crisp and feature a striking Liquid Silver outline plus a Race Red center stripe. Pay attention to even the smallest details like panel gaps and you’ll be convinced the fit and finish of this Cobra replica is perfect."

That’s fine, because the Black Leather and Alcantara Double Stitch interior for this roadster provides simplistic style and modern comfort. There’s a carbon-fiber dash, red-faced Auto X gauges, flat-bottom race wheel, and other elements which are decidedly contemporary. Plus the Big and Tall package means the seats are wider, while the dropped footwell provides extra legroom for those vertically blessed."
