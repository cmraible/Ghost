These set unrealistic expectations for anyone who goes out and finds a vehicle which has sat for years and years in a literal barn, shed, garage, etc. They won’t be ready for the many mechanical issues, rat/bug infestation, brittle components, or even the paint damage since in these shows it seems like they take a fully detailed car, sprinkle some magic barn find dust over it, then start filming."

Whatever your opinion, this provides an unvarnished view of a barn find. That and it’s a damn cool car. Enjoy."
