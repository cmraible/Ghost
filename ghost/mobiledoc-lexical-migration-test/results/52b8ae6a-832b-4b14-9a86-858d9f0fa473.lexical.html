<p>Too often we fail to remember or learn (depending on how old you are) the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/when-can-you-consider-a-car-classic/">true importance</a> of certain classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle cars</a>. There have been many revolutionary models out there, but one of the most impactful was the 1982 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/best-trans-ams/">Pontiac Firebird Trans Am</a>. It was a dramatic reworking of a classic and helped to re-establish <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2011-trans-am-conversion/">American muscle culture</a> at a time it was admittedly struggling. It’s no small wonder why <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/restored-into-kitt-from-knight-rider/">KITT from Knight Rider was a third-gen Trans Am</a>, the car was that inspiring.</p>
<p>You can watch the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/remember-the-c4-callaway-twin-turbo-and-zr1/">MotorWeek</a>review of the ’82 Trans Am, which is accompanying this article. It’s a nice glimpse of how professional reviewers regarded the car back in the day. They first acknowledge <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pontiac-fiero-collection/">Pontiac’s heritage</a>, which included the brand sitting at the forefront of the muscle car glory days back in the late 60s and early 70s.</p>
<p>From there is an acknowledgment the Trans Am shared many parts as well as a platform with the Chevy Camaro Z28. But they didn’t drive or feel like the same car, thanks to Pontiac’s willingness to tune and configure the different components in a unique way. In fact, MotorWeek praises it as the best-handling car made in America.</p>
<p>While the 1982 model year marked the introduction of a new, very different generation for the Trans Am, it was in 1985 when a big leap forward was made by Pontiac. Multi-port EFI allowed the muscle car to punch past 200-horsepower. Just two years later, the 350 dropped as well as the GTA package. This is where the Trans Am yet again was regarded as the ultimate bad boy car.</p>

<p>Pontiac wasn’t done pushing the third-gen F-body to new heights. The ’89 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary model really punched things up with the turbo 3.8-liter V6, officially making it the most powerful Trans Am model since the ’74 Super Duty 455.</p>
<p>Today, we’re seeing the values of these third-gen Pontiac Trans Ams going up pretty steadily. There’s no reason to believe they won’t continue to rise for some time, thanks to their representing a return to form for American muscle.</p>
