Considering the current SRT8 pumps a healthy 475-horsepower from the 6.4-liter Hemi V8, that’s certainly enough to get even a heavy SUV moving in a hurry. But purists want to argue muscle cars only have 2 doors and are a certain size. We get it, you want to keep the standards they same they were back in the day. But times change and back then nobody could’ve conceived of an off-roader accelerating so quickly. It’s actually more impressive to see a Grand Cherokee rocketing down the track than something lighter."
