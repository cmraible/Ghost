<p>I have wisdom, wisdom born of bitter experience, to share with you:<span style="font-size:12pt;"></span></p>
<ul>
    <li>When you watch the beginning of a horror movie before bed, the mind feels free to finish off the story – starring you.</li>
    <li>Steamy dreams about your wife are much better than improvised horror.</li>
    <li>When running for a train, it pays to check which train it is.</li>
    <li>Office moves arranged while you are away will lead to you sitting somewhere you didn’t expect to sit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn from my mistakes, my disciples.</p>
