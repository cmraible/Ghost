However, your specification can have a huge impact on the resale value of your car, something that might be contributing to this Porsche Carrera GT being a bit of a bargain."

Its color also doesn’t impact the supercars impressive performance credentials of being able to reach 62 mph from a standstill in just 3.3-seconds, or reach a top speed of 205 mph. You know what? We actually rather like the car in Rubystone Red, as it is a nice contrast from the sea of silver Carrera GTs for sale."

At the 2000 Paris Motor Show in France, the Carrera GT was revealed as an engineering showcase, however, Porsche had no intention of putting the supercar into production. Well, that was until the overwhelmingly positive reception it received, and some people even wanting to place a deposit."
