<p>The most noticeable thing about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ybkJE-03HU&feature=emb_logo">this 911</a> is the widebody kit. While others have purchased such a kit from one of many aftermarket shops, this one is truly unique. Instead of being a kit, this widebody has been built by hand and only one was made. Alpine White paint always looks good on an air-cooled Porsche 911, while the red stripes and black graphics add a nice touch. On the modern end of things are Bi-Xenon projector headlights, so you’ll have a clear view of wherever you take this machine at night.</p>
<p>In the rear sits the legendary 3.6-liter VarioRam engine used in the Porsche 993. Many consider this to be the best flat-six engine Porsche ever made, especially since it allows you to rev high and have a lot of fun. It’s also the last of the air-cooled engines. Mated up to the flat-six is a new 915 5-speed manual transmission and a Wevo short-shifter. There are also upgraded 930 transaxles and custom headers included in this build. A Brembo big brake kit adds some much-needed balance so you can stick turns and make emergency maneuvers with confidence.</p>

<p>You can see in the photos there’s a roll cage dominating a good portion of the interior, making it clear this car is all about performance first. Alcantara covers the racing seats, dash, racing steering wheel, door panels, etc. The factory gauges have been fully rebuilt, a nice original touch.</p>
<p>While the builder isn’t listed, the seller is willing to disclose that information in a private communication, stating many cars from the builder have been featured at Concours d’Elegance. Invoices and paperwork related to this build are also available. Considering the fantastic upgrades installed in this good-looking Porsche 911, the Buy It Now price of $145,000 seems like a relative deal. There’s a strong possibility it could go for over that amount, unless someone beats everyone to punch and scoops it first.</p>
