However, there is a lot of risk with driving a collectible, mainly being the damage that can happen on the road, how much your insurance would cover in the event of a wreck, and even just being able to find service parts for rare or older classics. However, these things have not stopped Mark Elder from daily driving his 90-year-old classic car to work everyday."
