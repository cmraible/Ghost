<p>Ayoob Mohammed has had one clear goal: permanent reunification with his wife Aierken Mailikaimu and their children in Canada. Yet for more than a decade, a false claim about Mohammed’s membership in the East Turkestan Islamic Movement — a purported terrorist organization that, according to the Chinese government, has ties to al-Qaeda and the Taliban — has followed Mohammed like a shadow.</p>
<p>After 9/11, Mohammed was sold to the U.S. for bounty as an alleged terrorist and held in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. After his exoneration, he resettled in Albania, the only country that would accept him. Since his release from Guantanamo, Mohammed struggled to gain entry into Canada, where the government slapped inadmissibility decisions on him based on shaky evidence they received from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>As we highlight below in this edition of Weekend Reader, Mohammed’s story spotlights the Uyghurs, “a largely Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic group native to Xinjiang” in northwest China; their tireless fight for independence from a repressive Chinese government; and how they have gotten caught in a geopolitical web tied to the U.S.’ failed war on terror.</p>
<p>Read all about it in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for supporting subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

    <li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/uyghur-exile/?src=longreads&mc_cid=e48e300f5f&mc_eid=cb62c68dfb"><strong>Endless Exile: The Tangled Politics Keeping A Uyghur Man In Limbo</strong></a><em><strong></strong></em>(The Walrus) — <em>“Some sixteen years after his release, the spectre of Guantánamo still follows Mohammed like a shadow. Invisible geopolitical forces have bent his story to their will — a story that has become so tangled and intractable that it is no longer his. How he landed in Guantánamo — so far from his birthplace in China — has been repeatedly scrutinized by media, researchers, and authorities, and is rooted, in part, in the history of Uyghur repression by the Chinese state. This repression has included the construction of a terrorist narrative to justify China’s mistreatment of the Uyghur people. Still, decision makers charged with Mohammed’s fate have yet to demarcate evidence from propaganda.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/media-hawkish-iraq-ukraine_n_622125c4e4b042f866eaf43c"><strong>The Media Are Still Clinging To Their Hawkish, Pro-War Tendencies</strong></a> (HuffPost) — <em>“There’s far more questioning, on both sides of the aisle, about whether the United States needs to jump in and fix all the world’s problems with boots on the ground. But some things remain, such as the media’s tendency to embrace their hawkish side. And it’s been creeping into the coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some high-profile media figures have pushed bellicose, and even reckless, rhetoric over the past week, suggesting to varying degrees that America should take steps that would almost inevitably lead to war with Russia.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://thephoenix.earth/ipcc-summary/"><strong>IPCC: This Is Our All-Hands-On-Deck Moment</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Phoenix) — <em>“In short, this report describes a crime scene. In this morning’s press conference announcing the report, political leaders from the UN spared no punches in naming the criminals: The fossil fuel industry and their enablers. In all my years as a climate reporter, that too was a first.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://the.ink/p/exclusive-ukraines-email-pleas-to?s=r"><strong>EXCLUSIVE: Ukraine's Email Pleas To Silicon Valley</strong></a> (The.Ink) — <em>“Russia’s war with Ukraine continues apace, in the terrestrial and digital arenas. In recent days, high officials in Ukraine have been pleading with Silicon Valley executives to crack down on Russia’s use of their platforms to spread government propaganda. In some cases, they appear to have gone further, requesting wholesale shutdowns of Facebook and Instagram in Russia. In the last few days, the tech platforms have responded with some measured changes, though none as far-reaching as what Ukrainian officials are seeking.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://lithub.com/ilya-kaminsky-on-ukrainian-russian-and-the-language-of-war/"><strong>Ilya Kaminsky On Ukrainian, Russian, And The Language Of War</strong></a> (Literary Hub) — <em>“Over the last twenty years, Ukraine has been governed by both the Russian-speaking East and the Ukrainian-speaking West. The government periodically uses “the language issue” to incite conflict and violence, an effective distraction from the real problems at hand. The most recent conflict arose in response to the inadequate policies of President Yanukovych, who has since escaped to Russia. Yanukovych was universally acknowledged as the most corrupt president the country has ever known (he’d been charged with rape and assault, among other things, all the way back to Soviet times). However, these days, Ukraine’s new government continues to include oligarchs and professional politicians with shrewd pedigrees and questionable motivations.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/searching-for-the-pigeon-lady/"><strong>Searching For The Pigeon Lady</strong></a> (Chicago Reader) — <em>“When I started trying to find the pigeon lady, or ladies, or whoever it is feeding the birds downtown, I’d never seen her, but I’d heard stories from people who live outdoors in the Loop. Sam sees the pigeon lady on weekday mornings, driving down Wells and tossing seed out of her passenger window with a bucket. Mark sees her in the same spot on weekday afternoons. And according to Kelly, two different pigeon ladies feed all the birds on Lake Street between State and Wells. The more I heard, the clearer it became to me that the pigeon lady is less of a gender or individual and more of a calling. The pigeon lady is white, she’s Asian, she’s Hispanic. She’s elderly and she’s middle-aged. She drives an SUV, she drives a sedan, she has a driver — a man who is her husband, or maybe her hired chauffeur. She is a driver, according to my friend Jeff; he says the pigeon lady is a male taxi driver who rolls down his window, stretches out his hand, and feeds the birds who land on it each morning while idling in the cab line at Union Station.”</em></li>
