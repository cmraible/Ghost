A smooth vinyl upholstery covers the interior and is contrasted by masterfully polished aluminum trim. There are two included tops. A black convertible soft top and a matching auxiliary hardtop. Power steering, power 4-wheel disc brakes, and power windows are among the included options. Oh and who could forget about the side-mount chambered exhaust system pronouncing the 427’s unmistakable tone. Right down to its brightly polished wheels, this 1967 Corvette is an absolute show stopper and it would be hard to find a car collector that would not pick it to lead a collection."
