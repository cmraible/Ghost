Responsive under throttle, the motor is topped with an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor setup and intake. The block is painted in a matching Lucerne Blue with custom chrome valve covers, a Billet pulley set, an aluminum radiator, and a black firewall that has matching inner fenders that allow for everything to pop out as it should. The car is a blast to drive as one bangs gears through a Tremec 5-speed manual transmission that spins the rear wheels. Handling is provided by a full Detroit Speed suspension that consists of subframe connectors, a four-link in the back, coil-over shocks, and Detroit Speed 'deep tub' wheel wells. Stopping all that power are Baer disc brakes on all four corners that run off a Wilwood booster. Power steering allows for easy maneuvering those corners and turns.

More interior upgrades include the custom door panels that house integrated speakers, along with a custom dash covers that incorporates plenty of suede material. A bespoke center console plays home to the Sony multimedia head unit, power window switches, and a big Hurst shifter. A 3-spoke steering wheel can be found in front of the driver's seat and the engine-monitoring part of the dash remains untouched from the factory. Overhead sits a brand new headliner, and new carpeting can be found below your feet. Aftermarket Speedhut gauges were installed and work fantastically with the upgraded motor. The Sony head unit mentioned above bumps through a powerful speakers system that has been installed throughout the inside. Keeping the interior nice and comfortable is the Vintage A/C that blows cold thanks to new hardware, and a tilt steering column can be adjusted to be comfortable for just about anyone sitting in the driver's seat. The trunk has also been redone to match the finish of the cabin. "
