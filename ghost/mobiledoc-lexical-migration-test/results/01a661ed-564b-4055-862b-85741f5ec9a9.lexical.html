<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.proxibid.com/2021-Mercedes-Benz-Wayfarer/lotInformation/68226966">Mercedes has</a> been the first name in the luxury and performance automotive industry since its creation in the early 1900s. Touring is a vital part of their history as the brand has undertaken many adventures on long-form racing circuits. This incredible ability is not only limited to racing, and sports cars, as the information, learned by Mercedes engineers, has been applied to virtually every one of their models. Surprisingly enough, this even applies to the luxury van and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1986-airstream-345-rv/">RV</a> market, which focuses on comfort, reliability, and luxury. So it seems almost fitting that one of the world's most incredible luxury RVs is a German-built Mercedes-Benz masterpiece. </p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/2021-Mercedes-Benz-Wayfarer/lotInformation/68226966">2021 Mercedes-Benz Wayfarer</a> coated in smooth silver paint reflecting decals that fit the description of a stereotypical luxury motorhome. Adding to the specialized paint job, you also get a set of dark steel wheels that create an unsuspecting aesthetic for the incredible vehicle. However, you won't find nearly the same subtlety on the inside of the RV because Mercedes made sure that their customers were taken care of. The most prominent evidence of this dedication to style, luxury, and comfort can be found in the lounge area and bed space meticulously crafted to create a comfortable relaxation experience. You might be wondering about the integrity of the RV as a vehicle, and we can assure you that this motorhome has been thoroughly optioned out to make it highly reliable and versatile.</p>

<p>Along with a complete a/c system, tankless water heater, and a shower, this vehicle comes with an Onan Generator, which allows you to plug in nearly any electrical appliance you could imagine. This lets you have some fun outside your RV and inside as it opens the possibility for lighting up the outdoors or even could help in an emergency situation. This is controlled by a touch screen affixed to the dash, which makes you the captain of everything that happens on your new ship. Overall, this great RV is the perfect vehicle for a <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/2021-Mercedes-Benz-Wayfarer/lotInformation/68226966">Mercedes enthusiast</a> passionate about the open road.</p>
