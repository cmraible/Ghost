<p>This past summer was a wild ride with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/riots-and-car-insurance/">riots</a>breaking out in many cities across the United States. As you probably already saw, Philadelphia was the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wisconsin-rioters-loot/">epicenter of violence</a> a few nights ago. We just ran across video of a C8 Corvette being stolen during the confusion in the streets and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-torch-porsche/">it’s pretty crazy</a>.</p>
<p>This 2020 Chevrolet Corvette was parked in a secure lot owned by a Chevy <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/virginia-dealership-damaged/">dealership</a>. These thieves didn’t come prepared since they used the car to crash through the gate. After breaking through they almost hit an SUV parked in the middle of the road. Then they clumsily reverse and take off toward the camera while onlookers giggle like a bunch of school children. We’re not dealing with the most skilled drivers out there.</p>
<p>In other words, this was likely a crime of opportunity. These people saw a cool car and decided to take it because the police weren’t there to stop them. They didn’t have any tools to cut through the gate lock, so they used the one thing they did have, the C8 Corvette.</p>
<p>Just the fact they used the car to break through the gate shows these people don’t respect the vehicle at all. It likely was taken for a joy ride and later ditched or will be in the near future. With an onboard GPS tracker it’s definitely traceable, which led to the recovery of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-steal-hellcats/">dozens of Dodges looted from a dealership</a> in California over the summer.</p>
<p>What’s even more maddening is these 2020 C8 Corvettes are in extremely short supply thanks to the COVID-19 shutdowns. People have been waiting and waiting patiently to get one while these entitled punks just decide to help themselves, immediately abusing the car that isn’t theirs.</p>
<p>If someone is wondering where the police are, they had their hands full with rioters assaulting them. Multiple news outlets reported dozens of injured officers. Meanwhile, you have these lovely individuals taking advantage of that to steal a high-end vehicle from a secure lot.</p>
<p>We’ll leave the regular news sites to get into what was behind the riots because we’re a car site and so we cover <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-riots-are-affecting-the-auto-industry/">what happens with vehicles</a>. When someone steals or vandalizes a collector vehicle during a riot or any other situation we’re going to cover it and not apologize.</p>
