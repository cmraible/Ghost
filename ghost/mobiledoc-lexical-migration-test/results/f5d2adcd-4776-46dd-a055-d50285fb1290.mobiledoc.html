<p>When Mopar unleashed the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/last-viper-dodge-commercial/">Viper</a> on the public, it was unlike anything available on the market, and this remains true today. The curvaceous American sports car was built with performance as the top priority. During the production of the Dodge Viper, it changed the automotive arena, and the way we look at cars. Even though the Viper is no longer being produced, it's a model that no one can forget. To celebrate the impact of the sports car, here's our picks of some formidable Vipers. </p>

<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/223733/2010-dodge-viper-srt-10-acr-voodoo-edition">A track-ready</a> 1 of 31 limited edition sports car is the kind of ride we all dream of owning. And this 2010 Dodge Viper SRT-10 ACR Voodoo Edition is that perfect example, because it's a 600hp mean green machine that has also been treated like the collectible that it truly is. This is Voodoo Edition #2, and it was the first one you could buy because Dodge CEO Ralph Gilles claimed #1 the moment they were unveiled. And you know he really loved these, because Gilles signed next to the special plaque in the center console.  If the Voodoo name sounds a bit intimidating that's because these are made for the track.  It started out life as the hot ACR version of the Viper that includes a carbon fiber aero body kit and an updated functional rear wing that debuted for the Voodoo edition.</p>

<p>ACR stands for American Club Racing, and it means the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/209661/2009-dodge-viper-acr">most extreme Viper built</a> for public roads is slithering our way. Most of the time, effort, and development dollars have been spent on stuff that makes the ACR go faster through the twisty bits-suspension, brakes, wheels and tires, and aerodynamics.  Especially the aerodynamics. Just chew on this for a moment: At 150 mph, the regular Viper coupe generates 100 pounds of downforce; at the same speed, the Viper ACR generates 1000 pounds of downforce.</p>
