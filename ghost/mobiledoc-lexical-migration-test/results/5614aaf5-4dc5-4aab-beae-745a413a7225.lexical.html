<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48-2/">Buying a modified car</a> can be risky. However, when done right, the extra modifications that the previous owner/builder made to the car can also make up for anything that the original vehicle could have been lacking and this Bronco is the perfect example of that. </p>

<p>While a regular old <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/volvo-p1800-restomod-2/">restoration</a> simply brings the car back to its original form, this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48-2/">1973 Ford Bronco</a> build is centered around the idea of making something better. With a limestone green exterior coupled with a revamped interior, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48-2/">this Bronco</a> takes style to another level. However, the most impressive part of this build is its ability to combine that form with plenty of function.<br></p>
<p>Under the hood of this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48-2/">high riding beast</a> is a 351-cid V8 which is mated to a three-speed automatic transmission. An Atlas dual-range transfer case helps to send that power to the 15-inch Weld Racing wheels which are wrapped in a set of massive 35x12.5 BF Goodrich all-terrain KO tires. All four corners are equipped with dual long-travel shocks which allow for maximum clearance and a monstrous presence. Stopping power is handled by disc brakes on all four corners and the dual side-exit exhaust makes for an incredible and bulky sound.<br></p>
<p>This truck helps to carry the original <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48-2/">Bronco’s</a> off-roading legacy into the modern era by making it comparable to newer models. In addition to the exterior style, huge tires, and crazy lift, the interior is also a sight to behold. When this stunning SUV was first released the focus was mainly placed on performance rather than interior quality. However, it excels where the original was lacking. With black vinyl seats, an aftermarket four-spoke steering wheel, and a Tuffy center console, you can ride around in style as you tackle the tough terrain of the mountain trails. </p>
