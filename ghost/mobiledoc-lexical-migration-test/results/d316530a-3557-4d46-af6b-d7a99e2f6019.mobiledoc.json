That’s why we’re seeing a lot of cases like this one out of the Miami-Dade areas in Florida where a Mercedes G-Wagon was stolen right out of a driveway and seemingly with little effort."

That’s the thing with the OE units is a thief not only can study where they’re located, but can practice on how to take them down so they can’t be tracked. We recommend that everyone use at least one additional aftermarket GPS tracker on their vehicle, for example the very inexpensive Apple AirTag. That way, if your ride is stolen you might still be able to find it."

With keyless entry and ignition, a lot of people have become absolutely lazy about this, leaving their key in the cupholder or center console. You’re basically just handing the vehicle over to a thief who’s bold enough to try the door handle, which is more common than you might think. Take your key with you, lock up the vehicle, and try being a little more responsible."
