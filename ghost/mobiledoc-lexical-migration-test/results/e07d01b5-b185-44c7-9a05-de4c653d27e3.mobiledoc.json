This situation just goes to show not all stolen cars are long gone, since sometimes they’re not taken by a huge theft ring and immediately shipped out the country. In other words, if your car has been swiped don’t give up hope."

Curtis was arrested for charges of Illegal Possession of Stolen Things, Altering or Removal of Vehicle Identification Numbers Prohibited, Forgery of a Certificate of Insurance, and one outstanding warrant. Shocker, the guy isn’t new to the system."

They say vehicle cloning or rebranding has been on the rise in Louisiana, which squares with reports we’ve seen out of other states. Unfortunately, if you’re duped by these cars and buy one, you will lose the vehicle, so you need to be cautious as a buyer."

Running a vehicle history report might uncover the fraud, as will a vehicle information check through the state motor vehicle department. Pay attention to any damage on or near the VIN tags, including mismatched screws holding the tag in place. You can check those tags against the VIN stamped in the engine, frame, or elsewhere on the car, if you know where those are supposed to be."
