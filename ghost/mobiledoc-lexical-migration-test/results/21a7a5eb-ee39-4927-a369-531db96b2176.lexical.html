<p>A prominent senator argues that Israel's atrocities in Gaza embody the extremism of the Netanyahu Government, and why the United States must use its leverage to stop the violence. Also, a powerful new essay reviews how the situation spotlights a double standard when it comes to right-of-return arguments about sacred homelands.</p><!--members-only-->

None of this excuses the attacks by Hamas, which were an attempt to exploit the unrest in Jerusalem, or the failures of the corrupt and ineffective Palestinian Authority, which recently postponed long-overdue elections. But the fact of the matter is that Israel remains the one sovereign authority in the land of Israel and Palestine, and rather than preparing for peace and justice, it has been entrenching its unequal and undemocratic control.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/teshuvah-a-jewish-case-for-palestinian-refugee-return/"><strong>Teshuvah: A Jewish Case for Palestinian Refugee Return</strong></a> (Jewish Currents) — “<em>In Jewish discourse, this refusal to forget the past — or accept its verdict — evokes deep pride. The late philosopher Isaiah Berlin once boasted that Jews ‘have longer memories’ than other peoples. And in the late 19th century, Zionists harnessed this long collective memory to create a movement for return to a territory most Jews had never seen. ‘After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion,’ proclaims Israel’s Declaration of Independence. The State of Israel constitutes ‘the realization’ of this ‘age-old dream.’ Why is dreaming of return laudable for Jews but pathological for Palestinians?”</em></p>

Climate-Friendly Eating Is on the Rise</strong></a> (Bloomberg) — <em>“Beef could be the new coal, shunned by elite tastemakers over rising temperatures and squeezed by increasingly cheap alternatives… Americans do claim to want a shift. Seventy percent say it would be healthier if the country ate less meat and 58% would like to eat more fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, according to a 2020 survey by the food market research firm Datassential.

Every Earth Day, we’re bombarded with tips about how to minimize our personal carbon footprints; meanwhile, it’s 2021 and the GOP is still suggesting tree-planting as climate policy… A new paper from Harvard science historians Naomi Oreskes and Geoffrey Supran shows that this sort of framing is no accident, it was by design.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week, I felt simultaneously proud of all the work we are doing here at <em>The Daily Poster</em>, and I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of news happening 24-7, frustrated that we are not yet at the scale to deeply cover it all.</p>
<p>In just five days last week, our small team's reporting exposed<a href="__GHOST_URL__/debt-collectors-spending-big-to-block-a-crackdown/"> debt collectors buying lawmakers</a>; lawmakers trying to<a href="__GHOST_URL__/democrats-gunning-to-end-salt-cap-stand-to-benefit/"> enrich themselves with tax cuts</a>; health care giants trying to<a href="__GHOST_URL__/punishing-the-pain-profiteers/"> kill a corporate accountability bill</a>; Republican governors'<a href="__GHOST_URL__/forcing-people-back-to-work-with-no-protection/"> lies about the jobless</a>; and<a href="__GHOST_URL__/investors-tell-dennys-to-stop-opposing-a-minimum-wage-hike/"> Denny's admission about a $15 minimum wage</a>. These are stories about corruption and economic violence that corporate media ignores — and we were able to nail them, thanks to support from our subscribers.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, the news was dominated by Israel's violent assault in Gaza — a hugely important, complex topic. Some have asked us why we didn't immediately drop everything to cover that story — which is an inquiry we get about every hugely important topic whenever news breaks anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The queries are absolutely fair. I share the abiding desire to deeply cover every single topic in the world, and part of what we do with features like <em>The Midday Poster</em> and <em>The Weekend Reader</em> is spotlight other people's good reporting and commentary on a wide variety of topics (see today's links about the Israeli violence). But I want you to know I share your frustration that while our small team is producing terrific journalism, we are not yet at a size and scale to produce original reporting on literally every topic that deserves coverage.</p>
<p>I also want you to know that reality doesn't mean we don't <em>care</em> about those topics (As one example: I am personally outraged by the war crimes Israel has been committing; I have long believed Benjamin Netanyahu is a monster and<a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1393787528369508358?s=20"> I've publicly said that</a>; and the fact that the violence is being committed in the name of my own religion deeply depresses and enrages me). </p>
<p>Put another way: Our present coverage limitations do not reflect a values decision. They reflect our still-small size, and the reason we are working so hard to grow our subscriber base, which will allow us to hire more reporters and do more journalism.</p>
<p>Every single day, our team tries to make good decisions about how to best deploy our still-limited reporting resources. But as a small, reader-supported news outlet, our question is not just, what is the big news of the day? Our questions are also: What is <em>not</em> being covered that deserves coverage? What coverage gaps can we fill that have the best chance to make the most impact? How can we most effectively use our small team's specific expertise to not just repeat what's already being said, but to instead actually add something new and substantive to the conversation?</p>
<p>As one of our subscribers, you deserve to know about our decision-making process — and an integral part of that process is your feedback. You should always email us at <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> or post a comment to let us know about what kind of coverage you want. That input is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>You don't have to agree with everything we do — but I hope you will at least appreciate that we are earnestly trying to make the best editorial decisions possible, always asking how we can make the most impact.</p>
<p>Thanks as always for your ongoing support. We could not do this work without you. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
