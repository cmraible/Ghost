<hr>
<p>When you think about performance trucks from GM, especially as it pertains to the 1990s, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-find-1991-gmc-syclone/">GMC Syclone</a> is probably the first model that comes to mind. However, the 1990 Chevrolet 1500 454 SS was one bad pickup. Ones like this example remind us what we miss about 1990s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-ram-1500-trx/">performance truck culture</a>.</p>

<p>While the GMC employed a turbocharged V6 for power, the Chevy instead had a 454 cubic-inch, 7.4-liter Big Block Chevy V8 - this massive engine is mated to an automatic transmission. While it’s a bit underrated at 230-horsepower and 280 lbs/ft of torque, many road tests have shown that’s plenty to carry the truck to figures like a 7.7-second sprint to 60 mph, and a 15.9-second quarter-mile. On top of having respectable track times for the 90s, the 1500 454 SS was actually useful for what trucks were made to do - work.</p>

<p>This sharp looking model came with the same load and tow rating as the 1500s, and has a fully functionally truck bed, side steps, and truck tires. If you waned a work truck that could get out of its way in 1990, this would be the one you’d pick.</p>
