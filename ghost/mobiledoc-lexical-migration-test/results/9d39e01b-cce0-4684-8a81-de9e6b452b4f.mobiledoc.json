Just look at vehicles like the Firebird, Camaro, Corvette, and even some of the less-expected models that didn't exactly scream sports car but had every ounce of that DNA in them. Truly, these two Brands wanted desperately to be the head of GM's performance lineup which is something Pontiac particularly managed to do pretty well. Just take this "

It might seem crazy but this SE model is a Richard Petty limited edition. On top of that, it has a 3.4-liter V6 engine and an automatic transmission to make smooth power transfer. The blue exterior and blue accented chrome wheels tie everything together as well. Overall, it's a very unexpected look from a legendary brand."

          ", it's easy to see what made these vehicles attractive in the early 1990s. The interior is incredibly driver-focused with red leather as far as the eye can see while the body keeps the shape of a sports car for aerodynamics and good looks. Of course, under the hood has always been the specialty feature of these cars and this 350 cubic inch V8 engine shouldn't disappoint. That's because it's got 300 horsepower which flows through an automatic transmission making it wildly fast for its time. Together, these two sports cars represent everything right about GM and you might be their next driver. "
