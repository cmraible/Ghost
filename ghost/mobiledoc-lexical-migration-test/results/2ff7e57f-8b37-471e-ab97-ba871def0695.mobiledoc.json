Before being imported to the U.S. by its first owner, the Miura was repainted red, and then its second owner – a Lamborghini engineer – had the engine converted to a dry-sump oiling system in 1978 making it \"one of few\" Miuras to use this setup. The dry-sump oil reservoir is located under the front hood with the spare tire and battery."
