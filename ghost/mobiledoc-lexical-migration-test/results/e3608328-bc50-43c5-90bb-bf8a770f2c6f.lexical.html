<p>If you’re a big fan of Japanese domestic market cars and live in America, you’ve likely been relishing the number of iconic Nissan Skyline models that are becoming eligible to import. The ’25 year rule’ allows cars of that age and older to be imported to the US, this 1991 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167360/1991-nissan-skyline-gts-t-type-m">Nissan Skyline GTS-T Type M</a> is one such car.</p>
<p>Listed in our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167360/1991-nissan-skyline-gts-t-type-m">classifieds</a> by import specialist <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Fast+Lane+Auto+Sales">Fast Lane Auto Sales,</a> this clean Type M is in incredible condition. Presented in black, the highly polished example of a stock R32 Skyline is an enthusiasts dream. While some hanker for the potent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/perfect-r32-nissan-skyline-gt-r">GT-R</a> model, the Type M features some unique bodywork and five-stud 16-inch alloy wheels of its own.</p>

<p>The interior is equally as impressive with the 27 year-old cabin somehow managing to elude time itself. Its carpets, seats, and dashboard almost appear unused, with the only hint of the car’s past life being a worn steering wheel. Practical rear seats and a good size trunk means that this is a modern classic you could daily drive.</p>

<p>GTS-T Skylines are equipped with a turbocharged RB20DET inline six-cylinder engine, yet another item on this Nissan that is well presented. Unlike the GT-R, this variant is rear-wheel drive — arguably making for a purer driving experience. The lack of an all-wheel drive system also makes this car lighter than its high-performance sibling. Its five-speed manual transmission should also make for a great companion when calving up those canyon roads.</p>
<p>Fast Lane has conducted a thorough service on this Skyline that included fresh oil and filters, replacement drive belts, new AC actuator, coolant flush and refill, and the fitment of a Venom catalytic converter.</p>
<p>The current asking price for this near pristine Skyline GTS-T Type M is $16,500.</p>
