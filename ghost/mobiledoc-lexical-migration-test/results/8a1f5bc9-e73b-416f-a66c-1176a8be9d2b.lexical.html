<p>Among enthusiast favorites and probably one of the most <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=21110&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=junesale14">legendary Bond cars</a> is the Aston Martin DB5. This car has made more appearances than any other car though many other great Aston Martin cars, such as the Vantage V8, were featured in Bond films as well. BMWs were another staple idolized by the franchise as a BMW 750iL and a BMW Z8 were both featured cars in the 1990s. Some of the lesser recognized cars include a Mercury Cougar, a Toyota 2000GT Roadster, and a Ford Mustang. Claiming the title as the oddest selection is a Citroen 2CV. However, one of the wildest of all of the Bond cars has to be the Lotus Esprit S1 from the 1977 film, <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>.</p>

<p>Cars can be restored any number of times and restorations, no matter how poorly they are done, can be redone over and over again. These can go as far as desired with modifications to suit the owner or be as simple as a return to original condition. This is especially true with classic cars as they offer the most blank slate, if you will. Now we are not saying that there is not something to be said about the classic style and modern performance of a properly done restomod, but rather just stating the clear fact that a car is only original once and if you find that well preserved original example of your favorite car, then you have found something truly special. For the Corvette enthusiast or collector, this 1967 427 Corvette "Survivor" being offered by GT Motor Cars may just be one of the best examples the collector market has ever seen.</p>

<p>1969 marked the beginning of the NASCAR aero-wars. Four of the biggest names in American Racing all wanted the same thing, to be known as the fastest to go around the oval track. Ford and Mercury had the Torino and Cyclone as their race cars that they upgraded with the respective Talladega and Spoiler II packages. These cars kicked off the battle, however, Dodge had its rebuttal and in 1969 it released a special edition model that absolutely dominated in the aero-wars - the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona.</p>

<p>There are fewer generations with more ability to create nostalgia than the 1980s. <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=21104&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=junesale">The cars</a>, while not your typical muscle cars, flashy by today’s standards, or even really that powerful, had a way of winning the hearts of those that drove them. Likewise, film played a big role in the 1980s and for Zach and Stephanie Dandera there was one movie in particular that really struck a chord. ‘Back To The Future’ was the epitome of what the 1980s were all about for the couple who met at a local Columbus, Ohio club’s ‘80’s night in 2005. This shared admiration for the 1980s blossomed into the relationship that followed and just three years later they moved from Ohio to Florida which allowed them the opportunity to build an entertainment company, Dandera Entertainment Inc.

<p>In 1964, the Mustang created an all new segment in the automotive market. Attention was immediate and profound, and the Mustang quickly became one of America’s favorite cars. With three assembly plants working around the clock to accommodate the market, Ford added to its successes with an all new K-Code Fastback model in 1965. The K-Code 2+2 Fastback Mustang featured a 271-­horsepower 289-cid High-Performance V8 engine topped with a special Autolite four­-barrel carburetor from the factory, implementing solid valve lifters and a 10.5:1 compression ratio.</p>

<p>Plymouth and Dodge “B" body cars made their debut in 1962. With a misunderstanding that Chevrolet would be downsizing their cars for that model year, Chrysler's designers reworked their planned design on a shortened chassis. Though marketed as "full-sized" cars, the "B" body cars were in fact much smaller than Ford’s and Chevy’s offerings for the vehicle class, giving Dodge and Plymouth “B” bodies a clear advantage when fitted with a V8 engine.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, as Mopar bodies were shedding weight, Mopar engine options were getting bigger. The HEMI, now displaced 426-cid and when combined with the lighter Chrysler offerings made for a car that would break Ford's grip on NASCAR and absolutely dominate the NHRA track. Just under the mid-trim for the 1964 model year, the Dodge 330 A864 was a historical step forward for Mopar’s legendary motorsport record.</p>
