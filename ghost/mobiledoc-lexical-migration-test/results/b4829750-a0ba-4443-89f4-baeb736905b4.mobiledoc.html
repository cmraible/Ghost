<p>Corvette enthusiasts are familiar with the name Chip Miller, who founded Carlisle events along with his business partner Bill Miller (no relation). Chip, a proud Corvette enthusiast, has owned over 80 Corvettes. Sadly, Chip passed away in 2004 of amyloidosis, and that's when his wife Judy and partner Bill started the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation in his honor. </p>
<p>One of the biggest events in the country, the Spring Carlisle show is the place to be when it comes to collector and classic cars and is a must for any car enthusiast. Corvettes of Carlisle is the largest gathering of 'Vettes in the world, and it brings in about 5,000 of them each year.</p>
<p>The all-new <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=ARTICLE834">2020 C8 Corvette</a> is an American supercar with an aerodynamic body that is a first for Chevrolet's flagship sports car. This particular car is a high-performance Z51 model equipped with the Carbon Flash Exterior Badge Package including exterior accents, side vents, and front/rear grille accents. More exterior highlights include a unique rear spoiler, front splitter along, and front brake cooling inlets. A set of staggered Bright Silver-painted aluminum 5-spoke wheels grace the exterior and come wrapped with all-season black-wall performance rubber (245/35ZR19 front, 305/30ZR20 rear). Other options include front intermittent wipers, daytime running lamps, LED headlamps, Solar-Ray light-tinted glass, and a color-matched removable roof panel. Even the manual-folding side mirrors come with turn signal indicators and are outside-heated and power-adjustable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=ARTICLE834">C8 Corvette Z51</a> is powered by a mid-mounted LT2 6.2-liter V8 engine complete with direct injection, variable valve timing, and active fuel management backed by a M1L 8-speed dual-clutch transmission with manual and auto modes. Sitting on an aluminum-structured frame, the Z51 package includes a performance rear axle ratio and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Stopping power is provided by anti-lock disc brakes on all four corners that clamp via black-painted brake calipers. This high-performance C8 handles like a champ thanks to the FE1 Corvette suspension, all-speed traction control, and active handling stability control. Additional performance and additional rumble comes from an aluminized stainless steel exhaust that exits via stainless tips. Last but not least, the oil life monitoring system allows you to keep vital signs in check.</p>
<p>With an impressive 495-horsepower and 470 lb/ft of torque, <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=ARTICLE834">the new Corvette Z51 </a>tops out at 184 miles per hour. On top of that, it can launch from 0 to 60 in just 2.9 seconds, and it nabs a quick quarter-mile time in just 11.2 seconds. Dyno testing shows that GM may have underrated the power input with some tests reading as high as 558-horsepower and 515 lb/ft of torque at the tires.</p>
<p>Open the doors of this <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=ARTICLE834">Z51 'Vette</a> to GT1 Competition seats with Mulan leather complete with perforated inserts. In front of the driver sits a leather-wrapped steering wheel with power tilt and telescoping functionality. Your favorite jams will be played through a Bose 10-spark premium sound system. An 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen displays Chevrolet's latest infotainment systems along with a 12-inch cluster display that can be changed to any color your heart desires. Of course, the car is equipped with an HD rear-vision backup camera and keyless open and start.</p>
