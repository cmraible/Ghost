<p>This 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air Convertible is the epitome of the classic cruisers of the 1950s and this one is a stunning example, having underwent a complete frame-off restoration. 1957 was the last year of the Tri-Five Chevys and it has to be one of the most iconic classic cars of all time. The 1957 Bel Air saw Chevrolet add tail fins with beautiful side trim that was much larger than the previous 2 years and the gold "Chevrolet" script trim and gold "V" hood trim was carried through to the '57 model. This particular '57 Bel Air Convertible comes to us out of a very large collection in Texas, where the previous owner clearly took excellent care of the car.</p>

<p>For consignment one of ONLY 12 known to exist, (the rest literally rusted away), 1958 DeSoto Firesweep Convertible. This particular model was only produced for 3 years and this exact model year as a convertible topped the production charts with a run of a mere 700 unitsâ€¦a very rare bird indeed. These cars were built on the cheap, and no attention was paid to surfaces exposed to the elements, particularly underneath, and they literally began to rust within two years of their purchase. So a low run, and the rust problem make this particular car a real find.</p>

<p>The new 1970 Plymouth Barracuda was introduced along with the all-new Dodge Challenger. Both shared the new E platform, a new platform for 1970 which kept with the pony car mantra...long nose, short deck. An extremely similar look shared by the cars fittingly resulted in them being known as the Mopar Twins. For consignment one of the twins, but this one has been the recipient of a rotisserie restoration, which has been well documented. At this time this car received new fenders, new quarter panels, new front and rear valance panels, and a new convertible top. Bathed in two tone paint, and now with a 440ci engine let's just say rock and roll and hold on to the Jesus bar.</p>
