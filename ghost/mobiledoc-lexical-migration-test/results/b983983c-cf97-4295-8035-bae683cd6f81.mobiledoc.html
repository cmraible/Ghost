<hr>
<p>A 1988 Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth recently crossed the auction block and was poised to set a new record. With only 500 of these hot hatches made, they’re a target of many collectors and investors, a unicorn Brits dream of adding to their garage. And when the dust settled, this particular example came near to setting the record, although it fell short. Still, it sold for £124,000 which probably shocks most Americans.</p>

<p>Bidding was reportedly fierce, with 58 total for the online auction. With just 13,933 miles showing on the odometer and a pretty immaculate presentation inside and out, it’s no wonder people went wild for this thing. Sure, in this market it wouldn’t have made much of a splash, but in the UK this thing really stirs the emotions.</p>

<p>Here in North America, the only automotive product known as a “Sierra” is made by GMC and it’s a truck, so a lot of you might be wondering what’s the deal with this little Ford hatchback. Well, we did get it in this market for a brief time in the late 80s but it was called the Merkur XR4Ti. You might still be confused because this vehicle has been forgotten by many, however there’s a cult following for it on this side of the pond.</p>

<p>However, over in jolly ol’ England, the Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth is a rockstar. With a turbocharged four-banger engine, it’s a homologation special that gave enthusiasts a chance to experience what their hero rally drivers feel when behind the wheel. The record for one auctioning is a staggering £127,000 showing just how much collectors think of the little hot hatch.</p>
<p>Still, we don’t expect most American enthusiasts to understand what’s so alluring about the car. Just know that on the other side of the pond, it’s a big deal and that in turn means big bucks.</p>
