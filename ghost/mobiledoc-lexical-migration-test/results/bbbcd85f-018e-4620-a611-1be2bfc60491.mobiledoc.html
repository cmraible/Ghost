<p>First, let’s get back to the rugged and capable nature of this truck. Right off the bat you should note the Warn winch mounted on the front, perfect for helping recover lesser 4x4s but hopefully not yourself, but you have it there just in case. Two big D-rings on either side of the winch are perfect anchor points, too. A brush guard helps protect that nice yellow paint from damage on the trail, while roof lights provide additional illumination if you stay out past sunset. There’s even a massive rooftop basket for you to strap down all kinds of gear, because room is in no shortage.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, this Hummer H1 comes with the 6.5-liter turbo diesel V8. That’s the engine you really want for leaving roads behind, thanks to not only its legendary durability, but also that all-important low-end torque for pulling through really tough conditions.</p>
