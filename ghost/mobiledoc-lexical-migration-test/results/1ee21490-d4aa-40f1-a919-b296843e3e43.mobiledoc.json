          " was when Mr. Miyagi had Daniel do different chores, including waxing all his classic cars. What most people didn’t fixate on at the time was the martial arts master was actually a gearhead. He had a pretty impressive collection going in his yard. Instead of favoring vehicles from his homeland of Japan, Miyagi only owned Detroit steel. Each of his cars looked excellent, showing the immigrant from Okinawa meticulously cared for them."

During its heyday, this half ton light commercial truck might have been the beast of burden for a small business as part of the lifeblood of the community. That role made these pickups absolutely iconic, a symbol which very much resonated with audiences back in 1984."

When Daniel has his birthday, his teacher allows him to choose one car to take out on the town to celebrate and he immediately chooses the ’47 Ford. Then he proceeds to use the classic ride to impress Ali. It’s not hard to see why she’s so smitten with the car and its shiny yellow paint flaunting those sculpted body panels – the thing is quite the looker."
