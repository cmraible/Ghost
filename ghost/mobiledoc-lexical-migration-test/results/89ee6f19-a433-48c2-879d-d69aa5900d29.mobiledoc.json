As you can see on the very front of the car's Hood, they're quite a few decals that show its different racing affiliations. Of course, the body isn't the only spectacular thing about this vehicle as shown By the full roll cage on the inside. That is a very necessary piece of safety equipment as "

Being a competition engine, it's easy to imagine how the builders might have tweaked the design severely compared to what was actually in the production models. Nevertheless, you'll have immense amounts of fun rolling through the gears on your four-speed manual transmission and sliding around with the help of your limited slip differential. All of these things combined to make this particular 1980 300zx one of the best and most iconic race cars of its time and now you could be its next driver."
