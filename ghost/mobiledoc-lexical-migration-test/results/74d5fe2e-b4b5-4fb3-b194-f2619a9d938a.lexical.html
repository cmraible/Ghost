<p>A fleet of tow trucks descended on sleepy St. John, Kansas recently to move a large collection of cars which were <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/grandma-stashes-two-exotics-in-garage/">stashed away</a> by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bouncy-house-car-collection/">the late Bob Regehr</a>. The Moon Walk <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/140-car-collection-heading-to-auction-this-fall/">bouncy house inventor</a> and entrepreneur was quite the gearhead, something many people didn’t realize about him. His 140-plus car collection is heading to the auction block this Saturday, with quite a few notable examples which should spark some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bidding-war-erupts-1985-chevy-truck/">bidding wars</a>.</p>
<p>According to a local news report, both a former laundromat and Ford garage in St. John were emptied out. These two buildings have served as storage facilities for part of the 140-plus car collection. That kind of movement of so many classic vehicles would cause quite the stir in such a small city, so it’s understandable why the locals were excited.</p>
<p>In fact, St. John resident Dick Smith told a reporter he ran home to get his camera once he realized what was happening. He posted some of the photos to Facebook.</p>
<p>The cars have been stored at multiple locations in a few different cities. Now they have to all be gathered up for the auction taking place this Saturday, October 24.</p>
<p>Regehr was apparently a huge fan of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1932-ford-chip-foose-video/">1932 Fords</a> with over 20 of them in his collection. In fact, out of the 140-plus cars he tucked away, over 50 wear a Ford badge, so it might have been his favorite brand. Surprisingly a mere 2 are Mustangs, so he obviously wasn’t gaga over the pony car.</p>
<p>However, Regehr’s collection includes quite a few Chevrolets, including 8 different Corvettes ranging from a 1956 C1 to a 1978 C3. He also held onto Cadillacs, Pontiacs, and Buicks.</p>
<p>Not all of the cars Regehr stashed away are American classics. There’s a red 1979 Ferrari 308 GTS included, but it’s the only one from Maranello.</p>
<p>The auction takes place this Saturday, October 24, 2020 through VanDerBrink Auctions. Check out the details <a href="https://www.vanderbrinkauctions.com/auction/the-amazing-bob-regehr-collection-approx-140-plus-vehicles/">here</a>.</p>
