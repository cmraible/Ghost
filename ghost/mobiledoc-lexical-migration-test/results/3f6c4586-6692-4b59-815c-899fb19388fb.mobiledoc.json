The seller claims this scooter has been “babied” since new, having only been ridden 2,485.5 miles. That’s pretty incredible, considering other Cushman Eagles weren’t treated as kindly."

After all, it was designed to look like motorcycles made by Harley-Davidson and Indian, instead of something softer, so it had a lot of visual appeal. Even some adults who wanted an easy-to-ride two-wheeler fell in love with the cruiser design elements like the large circular headlight, wide handlebars, swoopy fenders, and teardrop fuel tank."
