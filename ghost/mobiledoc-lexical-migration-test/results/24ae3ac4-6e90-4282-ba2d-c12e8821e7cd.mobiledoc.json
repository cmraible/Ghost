Mason adds to Levitz’s rosy view of the economy in a blog post, pointing out that without the American Rescue Plan and other investments, the economy could be in a much worse place. “It’s somehow becoming conventional wisdom that the economy is ‘overstimulated,’ as if the economic disruptions of the pandemic could have been managed some other way,” Mason writes. “As Claudia Sahm observed last week, the choice facing policymakers was either to repeat the mistakes of the Great Recession or to go big. Fortunately, they went big.”"

But the phenomenon is hardly limited to Congress. Across the old Rust Belt, from St. Louis to Pittsburgh and Buffalo to Detroit, you will find showy development and claims of downtown renaissances — alongside stifling poverty, a degraded public sector, and rampant police misconduct. Democrats have largely overseen these disasters, but for those who wish to challenge them the Democratic Party tends to be the only viable vehicle from which to do it.”"

Tara McGowan does, to be fair, have some experience in the politically-motivated, ultra-partisan news space — but it’s on the wrong side. Acronym founded a news outlet, Courier Newsroom, which solely produced news favorable to Democratic candidates and elected officials, an unusual blend of newsroom and political action committee that might, in less polite company, be termed propaganda… All of this makes it a bit surprising that billionaire philanthropists Reid Hoffman and George Soros are funding what Axios describes as ‘a multi-million seed investment’ into a new venture called Good Information, Inc., which, per Axios, will be led by McGowan.”"
