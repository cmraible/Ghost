An impressive product from Adobe that's being improved quickly. \n\n###Web-based\n\n- [Wotchit ](https://www.wochit.com)— commercial product, designed especially for social video production. Worth checking out if you’re serious about it.\n- [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/home/) – also available on iOS\n- [Vimeo Create](https://vimeo.com/create) - a realtively new, online social video creator. Very promising.\n\n###Desktop/Laptop\n\n- [iMovie](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/imovie) — free with Apple devices. Quite a powerful editor, but limited in its captioning options.\n- [GoPro Quik ](https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/quik-%7C-desktop/Quik-Desktop.html)— surprisingly versatile free editor from GoPro\n- [Final Cut Pro ](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12&at=11lLfX)— Apple’s pro-level editor. An easy step up from iMovie when you get frustrated by its limitations.\n- [Adobe Premiere Elements](http://amzn.to/2g6O69l) — probably the best low-cost PC video editor. (Also available on Mac)\n- [Adobe Premiere Pro](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere.html) — The industry standard video editor. Often it’s a sledgehammer to crack a pistachio nut — but there are times when you appreciate the depths of its toolset\n\n###iOS\n\n- [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8&at=11lLfX)— great app for getting started on video editing.\n- [LumaFusion](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lumafusion-pro-video-editing-and-effects/id1062022008?mt=8&at=11lLfX) — pro-level video editing on your phone (or, better, iPad) – highly recommended.\n- [FiLMiC Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/filmic-pro/id436577167?mt=8&at=11lLfX) — a great video capture app if you want more control than the built-in app offers\n- [ProCamera](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/procamera/id694647259?mt=8&at=11lLfX) — an alternative if FilmicPro isn’t to your taste.\n- [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/) - quick and easy social video (and graphic) creation\n- [Splice](http://spliceapp.com) - recently completely revamped, and now a powerful little social video editor, albeit at a subscription price. \n\n###Android\n\n* [Kinemaster](https://kinemaster.com/) – this seems to be the preferred Android editor amongst the mobile journalism community\n\n##Hardware\n\n###Cameras\n\n![The DJi Osmo Pocket](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2019/06/DJI-OsmoPocket_LS_friends_31_rgb_72.jpg)\n\n- **[The DJi Osmo Pocket 2](https://click.dji.com/AMcqSm1E6xffPQAuoSwKiw?pm=link)** — Not cheap (at over £300), but a handy gimbal-based complement to your pobile phone. High quality — and very unobtrusive — which can be very useful. Exptensive range of accessories, incluidng a mic adaptor for using a lavalier mic is and, with version 2, a wireless microsphone acessory. \n\n### Stabilisation\n\n![The Glif in use](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2016/08/glif-revised.jpg?resize=960%2C611&ssl=1)\n\n- **[Glif](http://amzn.to/2xv4bJe)** — a great product, Kickstarted a few years ago, that I highly recommend. Can be anything from a tripod adaptor to a full MoJo rig. Also [available with a wooden grip](http://amzn.to/2wAH4AQ). Go for that, if you have the budget. \n- **Shoulderpod** — this has been displaced by the Glif for me, but some people prefer the physical[ robustness of the R2](http://amzn.to/2xv4bJe)\n- [Gorillapod](http://amzn.to/2wAQs7w) – this is the best and most versatile small tripod they produce, I think. \n- [MicRig](http://amzn.to/2yz7oLV) – a new microphone and grip combination, funded via Kickstarter. Usable with phones, DSLRs, CSCs and GoPros.\n- [The DJi OM5](https://click.dji.com/AKEu-6EztFikjndx7le5_A?pm=link) – astonishing bit of kit for just £139 – a fully featured smartphone gimbal that’s really easy to use and suprisingly portable.This product line is improving year after year.\n\n### Microphones\n\n![Røde VideoMic Go](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/07/710TfsVX8lL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=960%2C507&ssl=1)\n\n- [**Røde VideoMic Go**](http://amzn.to/2wB2EoP) — fantastic value for money. Small, light and self-powered. A perfect “throw in the bag and go” mic for use with cameras or smartphone. You’ll need [this cable](http://amzn.to/2w0Chaj) to attach it to a smartphone, though\n- **[Røde SmartLav+](http://amzn.to/2wAAoCy)** — Great little smartphone lav mic, for attaching to lapels or people’s clothes.\n\n### Lights\n\n- [Manfrotto Lumimuse 6](http://amzn.to/2wANfoz) — also available in [3](http://amzn.to/2xeXrjr) and [8 LED](http://amzn.to/2vrBiML) versions, but I think the 6 is the best balance of price and output.\n\n### All Purpose\n\n![The Sevenoak SmartCine](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/02/smart-cine.jpg)\n\n- [The SmartCine by Movo](https://amzn.to/3c0LbHD) - and all in one combination grip, tripod mount, microphone and ringlight. Perfect for shooting interviews with your smartphone. Superb value for money. "
