Actually, it’s not even your brother’s Kawasaki Ninja. You can blow the doors or wheels off of just about anything else on the road, plus this hyperbike will hit a top speed of over 250 mph. You don’t even know the definition of thrilling until you get on this thing."

After all, the 2-speed automatic transmission is electronically controlled, so you don’t have to mess with gear transitions. There’s a Smart Start control panel to manage the different systems. You also benefit from advanced Ohlin adjustable shocks, ISR brakes, and levers to help you keep everything in check."

Carbon-fiber body panels are painted to stand out, while BTS carbon-fiber wheels and an aluminum chassis add further lightness. A swooping windscreen, humongous exhaust outlets, and high-quality details pull everything together. If that’s not enough to turn everyone’s head, the sound of a jet engine on the road is guaranteed to draw plenty of stares."
