Funny enough, he flipped on his hazards before starting the stunt, just in case. Still, young kids get stupid ideas which they sometimes follow through on. In this case, charging him with a misdemeanor seems a little heavy-handed. After all, those donuts were pretty tame. Maybe the prosecutor will cut him a deal, because the kid definitely needs to get it through his head driving that way isn’t a good idea."

The local government should really step up and maintain all those crackling surfaces better."
