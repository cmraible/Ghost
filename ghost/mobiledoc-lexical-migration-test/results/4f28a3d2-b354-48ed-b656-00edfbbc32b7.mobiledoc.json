But looking at old videos from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is a sobering reminder that safety tech is also downright lifesaving. Sure, it’s not perfect, but we don’t see many new cars turning into accordions in a head-on collision like some of these classic rides."

Some are nice to have, like a rearview camera in a Chevy Camaro or something else with absolutely horrible rearward visibility. But the inability to turn off certain safety aids like traction or stability control so you can really push the limits on a track is just plain annoying. That fact alone makes classic performance cars an absolute joy to drive."
