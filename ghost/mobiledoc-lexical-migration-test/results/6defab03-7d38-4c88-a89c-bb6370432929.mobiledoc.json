          "Cadillac made the Series 62 from 1940 to 1964, and it was one of the most recognizable models to come out of the golden age of American car designs. The dramatic looks of the 1960 Series 62 came about for the 1959 model year when Cadillac designers added those large tail fins and rear fender skirts, creating a look which is still iconic today. Plenty of collectors clamor for these cars, making it a wise move to scoop this one before values climb once more. "
