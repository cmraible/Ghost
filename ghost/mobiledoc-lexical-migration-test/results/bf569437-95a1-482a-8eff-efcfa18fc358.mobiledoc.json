His stepfather, Gentry, took him in as his own kid and taught him everything knew along with his passion for cars. To pay his mom and dad back for everything they have done for him, he decided to surprise them both with something incredibly special to blow them away."

          "The 1972 Pontiac Catalina convertible was bought by his stepfather's grandparents brand new, and his grandmother gave it to him when it was too big of a car for her to drive after his grandfather had already passed on. The classic Pontiac meant the world to Gentry. Dan remembers riding around in the car for years as a kid growing up, and he even used the car to learn how to drive. But like everything, eventually time caught up and took its toll on the classic Pontiac. Not able to continue driving duties any longer, the old car remained park for about ten years with hopes of working on it and fixing it up someday. According to Dan, he deserves this more than anyone."

Dan rented out the space so he could have many join in on the surprise reveal to his stepdad. The reveal may bring tears to your eyes as the covers come off the shiny gold classic. A rev of the motor from his mother had him speechless and nodding his head in approval. "
