Still, the Bonneville remained Pontiacs most luxurious model and the brand never skimped on performance for the model."

Although in 1970, styling peaked with one of the most dramatic redesigns of the entire model up to that point. It featured an entirely new front end with a twin vertical grill, integrated wrap-around turn signals, and a new standard engine - the infamous 455-cid."

With the exception of an aftermarket sound system and a new perforated bright white headliner, the blue vinyl interior appears relatively untouched and comes complete with walnut accents and a wood-grain steering wheel. If you believe the odometer, which says the car has been less than 20,000-miles since new, this is a good opportunity to get behind the wheel of the perfect Pontiac low-rider."
