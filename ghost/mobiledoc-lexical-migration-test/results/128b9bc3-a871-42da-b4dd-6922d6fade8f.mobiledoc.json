After all, you sink all that money into a car only to not have the asset in the end. The same thing is true of the emerging trend of car subscription services, something which automakers and others have been pushing for years because it makes them more money."

Unsurprisingly, only premium brands have even attempted these programs in North America as people who have greater amounts of disposable income and are image-focused tend to gravitate toward such luxuries. Both Volvo and Porsche have seen their services thrive, yet BMW and Audi both shut theirs down in early 2021."

But even with the successes, few consumers would be willing to take the plunge and use such a service. For those who think without boundaries, that might seem anti-progress but people have real concerns."

This is especially true if you’re using a car subscription service where you’re constantly rotating which vehicle you’re using. Just like with any community property, it’s really nobody’s job to keep things in good condition, just like how none of your lazy roommates feel an incentive to take out the garbage or scrub the toilet."
