RM Sotheby’s rightly counted on that late last month when it hosted the late Gene Ponder’s collection auction. However, the auction house might not have anticipated a Ferrari bed included as one of the lots would snatch some big cash."

When the dust settled, someone actually shelled out $5,000 for it, which is just astounding. We also really hope it was purchased for a child and isn’t going to be used by a short adult, but one never knows."

We don’t know if he used it personally or was enjoyed by his grandkids, or perhaps was just décor in a Ferrari-themed room. Maybe the man, who certainly had excellent business sense, could tell the collectable would be worth a few thousand one day."

There are also a smattering of nameplates on the bed, including a signature plate from Michael Schumacher himself. In other words, this twin bed was either made for a kid who’s a total nut about Ferrari racing or an adult who just couldn’t resist, or maybe both."

Another curious one was a set of three Ferrari trash cans which shocking went for $3,000. We know some diehard Ford fans will love making jokes about that, meanwhile the Chevy and Mopar guys will keep sharing photos of the blue Ford with its sunroof open in the parking lot."
