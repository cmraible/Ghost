          "While perusing the San Antonio listings for cars on Craigslist, we recently ran a project 1962 and 1964 Chevy Impala for sale. We know a lot of people are fans of ’62 and ‘64 Impalas, which certainly have a classic look combined with a certain level of comfort perfect for cruising around. However, these are non-running project cars, so if you buy either one or both, you won’t be doing any cruising in them right away."

Cleaned up, this ride could look really sharp, but it’s going to obviously need quite a bit of cosmetic work, with the seller admitting the quarter panels, rockers, and floors all need to be replaced. There’s a 283 engine and automatic transmission included, but we have no idea why this isn’t running. While the mechanical fix could be something small, it’s possibly more involved. The seller says the oil “looks good” and the engine isn’t locked up."

The interior is pretty rough with gaping holes in the upholstery and some nasty-looking carpet, but the dash looks intact, which is great if all the instruments are working. Like the other Impala, the seller says the engine isn’t locked up and oil appears good, so that’s all you get as far as a clue to any mechanical problems."
