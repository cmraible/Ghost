From classic Dodge Power Wagons to race-ready Le Mans competitors, the swooping fender flares, long hoods, and bright diverse color schemes were designed to do one thing, catch your attention. They did this extremely well which is why today these cars are seen as the pinnacle of design within the automotive community. While it is very unlikely, especially these days, to find your well-taken care of examples of these long-lost legends, there is still hope. This comes in the form of museums such as the LeMay Car Collection.",

Some of the cars included on this list of fine automobiles include multiple Model Ts, a 1940 Chevrolet Paddy Wagon, a ridiculous number of classic muscle cars, and many more. To try and cover each car individually would be a pipe dream so rather than focusing on the cars weâ€™d like to focus on the museum itself and the impact it had on the community.",
