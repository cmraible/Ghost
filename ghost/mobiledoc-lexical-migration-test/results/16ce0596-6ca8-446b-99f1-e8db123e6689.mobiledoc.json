That drives many of us to look for vehicles out of state, maybe even across the country, and sometimes internationally. The only problem is it’s easier to get scammed when you’re dealing over such distances, as clearly demonstrated by a recent report out of Indianapolis."

The problem was the dealership didn’t exist and the seller had no intention of sending the vehicle. Since the man wired the money to what he thought was a reputable dealership, he lost it all."

Instead, send a check or use your credit card to make the purchase. If there’s a problem, like you don’t actually get the car, you can cancel a check or credit card transaction. With wired funds there isn’t such an option."

If the seller glosses over the details or tries changing the subject, you’re probably dealing with a scammer. Same goes for asking exactly where the vehicle is located. After all, you’ll have to arrange transport if it’s far away."
