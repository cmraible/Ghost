A bespoke center console plays home to the Sony multimedia head unit, power window switches, and a big Hurst shifter. A 3-spoke steering wheel can be found in front of the driver's seat and the engine-monitoring part of the dash remains untouched from the factory. Overhead sits a brand new headliner, and new carpeting can be found below your feet. Aftermarket Speedhut gauges were installed and work fantastically with the upgraded motor. The Sony head unit mentioned above bumps through a powerful speakers system that has been installed throughout the inside. Keeping the interior nice and comfortable is the Vintage A/C that blows cold thanks to new hardware, and a tilt steering column can be adjusted to be comfortable for just about anyone sitting in the driver's seat.
