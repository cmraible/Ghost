The listing says that the car's 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine is locked up, and documented receipts show that this car last received major engine work in 1966. Other past work documented on this car includes a repaint in 1969 and a reupholstered interior in 1973. Overall, this is a complete car that will require a complete restoration, but once it's back on the road, it will be exciting to show off."
