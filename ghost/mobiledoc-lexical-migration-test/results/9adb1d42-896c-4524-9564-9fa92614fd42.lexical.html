<p>The Willy's Jeep has become one of America's most iconic offroading legends primarily for its part in the American military. It served as an all-purpose vehicle for carrying small groups of soldiers over treacherous terrain. Climbing rocks, driving through the mud and handling lots of bouncing around while still keeping on the straight and narrow path. Initially produced in 1941, Jeep quickly carved out a piece of the American automotive industry as the military's front-line manufacturer in tactical vehicles. These great utility vehicles made crossing rough terrain far less difficult for the soldiers whose lives depended on their reliability and ability to get the job done.</p>

<p>1970 was an incredible year for the classic General Motors muscle cars that we all know and love. Everything from the Chevelle to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-oldsmobile-442-w-30/">Oldsmobile 442</a> seemed to morph into entirely different beasts to the mid-'60s beast that they once were. This is especially true for the GTO, which had been in its third year of second-generation styling at that point. By then, people were in love with these cars whose rounder quarter panels and sloping hood had already cemented themselves in the hearts of enthusiasts across the nation. However, nothing could compare to the Pontiac predator that dominated the dragstrip at the time. Of course, many people would love to get their hands on this excellent car, but how would you go about doing so?</p>

<p>The 1960s were an excellent time for the classic trucks and early SUVs that we all know and love today. From the famous Chevrolet C10 to the now instantly recognizable Ford Bronco, it's safe to say that the first generations of these utility vehicles set an intense precedent for the models to come. GM has been particularly influential in Sport Utility vehicles, especially with the GMC Suburban, which initially boasted an exceptionally high carrying capacity and stylish design for the time. This means that many GM fanatics regard these SUVs as their dream ride and would jump at the opportunity to own one of these great cars. So what if you want to obtain one for yourself?</p>
