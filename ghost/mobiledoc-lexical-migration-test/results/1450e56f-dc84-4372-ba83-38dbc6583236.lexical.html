<hr>
<p>The skyrocketing price of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/classic-and-vintage">classic cars</a> combined with the general malaise the younger generation is perceived to have toward automobiles is creating a generational gap among car lovers. Thanks to inspiration from a non-profit dedicated to bridging that gap, a Canadian man is using his love of cars to pay it forward to one young enthusiast by giving away a rare <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/american-muscle">muscle car</a> project that is "rare as hen's teeth."</p>

<p>Casey Putsch of <a href="http://geniusgarageracing.com/">Genius Garage Racing</a> was contacted by a gentleman named Mike who lives in Ontario and had an idea to give away his original 1967 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mercury/Comet">Mercury Comet</a> Cyclone GT project vehicle to a younger enthusiast interested in rebuilding a car and not just fixing it up for a flip. Putsch had come up with a similar plan by selling a rare Greenwood <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Corvette">Corvette </a>to an enthusiast under the age of 25 with the same stipulation for keeping the car and fixing it up. Mike's car is in dire need of a restoration, but it's rare due to its "S" code 390 CID V8 and he's willing to part ways with it to keep the car restoring passion alive.</p>
<p>Mike says that he got into cars at a young age thanks to a teacher who recognized a reading disability. The teacher used the service manual from a 1970 Mercury Cougar to help Mike read, and he later sold him the car for just $50! His hopes are that the car goes to a younger enthusiast or becoming a parent/child project, and he's even willing to deliver his car to a reasonable distance. If you know someone who fits this plan, send an email to GeniusGarage@hotmail.com with the subject "musclecar" before March 31st.</p>
