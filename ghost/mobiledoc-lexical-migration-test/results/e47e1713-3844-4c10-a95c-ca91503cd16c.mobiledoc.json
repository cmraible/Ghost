The naturally aspirated, LS-based, dual overhead cam motor is mated to a Tremec T56 manual transmission, which allows all of that power to spin a set of HRE wheels. Holding the car stable is a Ford 9-inch rear end and 3.73 gearings. The chassis is a custom-built Roadster Shop chassis that sits on top of Corvette suspension. Stopping ability is provided by Bear Brakes."

          ", blue, and gold is used extensively to make the colors pop. Because of the ownerâ€™s need to have flush door handles the shop decided to opt for Tesla handles. The interior has been delicately crafted by hand, starting with an aluminum dash custom machined by Carlos Dominguez. Hand-stitched leather and carbon fiber interior were then placed on top of the bare metal. Seats consist of two modified Recaro racing seats fitted with carbon fiber backs. Lamborghini switches give the console an intricate and exotic feel which is further accentuated by the Ferrari vents. All of the interior work added up to a total of over $100,000. There are many pictures and videos of the car and its extensive adventures, we hope to see more in the future."
