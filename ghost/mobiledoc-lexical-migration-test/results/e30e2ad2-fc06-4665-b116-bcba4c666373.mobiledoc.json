One of their favorite targets is luxury vehicles since the yield from either shipping them overseas to be sold whole or chopping them up to sell the parts can be much higher. Police released bodycam footage of a raid on a chop shop in the West Midlands where several luxury vehicles were in different states of disassembly, including a recently stolen Land Rover Discovery."

Stacks and stacks of vehicle parts were also found on the property, showing these guys were trying to move a lot of merchandise."

The thieves were obviously eager to get rid of the thing, considering many often will park a stolen car in a public place for a few days to ensure there are no active trackers. That oversight might have been what led police to the chop shop, but that’s just a guess since police won’t disclose what tactics they used."
