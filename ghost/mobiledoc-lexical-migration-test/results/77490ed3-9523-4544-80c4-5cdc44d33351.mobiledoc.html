<hr>
<p>Hennessey Performance Engineering rocked the world when it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-maximus-rocks-the-jeep-world/">announced the Maximus</a>, a Jeep Gladiator with a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-hellcat-crashed/">Hellcat heart transplant</a>. While that build was certainly extreme, it was only a matter of time before someone dropped a Dodge Demon engine into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/custom-jeep-gladiator-rubicon/">Jeep truck</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, this Gladiator has a fire-breathing supercharged 6.2-liter V8 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-dodge-demon-race-classic-muscle-cars/">Demon engine</a> under the hood. You currently can’t get such a thing from a Jeep dealer or anywhere else we know of, and we wouldn’t be surprised if such a thing rarely is ever done before. This means you get 850-horsepower plus the 8HP75 8-speed transmission for explosive performance.</p>
<p>Of course, when adding so much power to a vehicle you have to make some modifications to accommodate that. One is a heavy-duty Griffin radiator so you’re not dealing with overheating as you really push this beast.</p>

<p>Instead of just using a run-of-the-mill Gladiator, someone decided to customize a 2020 Jeep Gladiator Launch Edition Rubicon. It still has the Rubicon transfer case, so this thing not only can charge down the road with extreme speed but also <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-cayenne-off-roader/">climb over rocks like a boss</a>. That’s especially true with the Enforcer Overland Stage 4 suspension and EVO King shocks.</p>

<p>As you can tell from the pictures, this Jeep Gladiator Demon is wearing a lot of aftermarket equipment. Among the goodies is a Dynatrac Pro Rock Hardcore Plus XD60 front and rear axle set, Adams driveshaft, custom-built 1350 front and rear drivelines, and a Fore Innovations dual-fuel pump system. This truck sits on big 40-inch tires with a JRC bed-mounted spare tire carrier. In case you need to help lesser vehicles on the trail, a Warn Zeon 10S winch is also mounted up and ready to go. There are many, many more mods on this thing, making it an impressive build.</p>
<p>This Jeep Gladiator Demon is headed to auction <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/no-reserve-auctions/">at no reserve</a> as part of the Barrett-Jackson Fall Auction 2020 event, which is coming up this October 22-24.
