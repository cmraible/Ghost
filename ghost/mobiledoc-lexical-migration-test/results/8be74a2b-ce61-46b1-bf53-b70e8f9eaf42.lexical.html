<h3 id="fusion-made-the-entire-thing-out-of-carbon-fiber-and-it%E2%80%99s-epic">Fusion made the entire thing out of carbon fiber, and it’s epic.</h3>
<p>By nature, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Lamborghini" rel="nofollow">Lamborghinis</a> are special cars, especially when you have something like a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/183197/2015-lamborghini-huracan-lp610-4-carbon-fiber" rel="nofollow">2015 Lamborghini Huracan LP610-4</a>. That said, this one stands apart from all others thanks to a custom carbon-fiber body kit made by Fusion Motor Company. Take this supercar literally anywhere and you won’t see another like it, so it’s the surefire way to stand out and be different.</p>

<p>The exposed carbon-fiber kit for this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a> includes the front bumper, hood, front fenders, side skirts, rear bumper, and rear wing. Since everything was fabricated using molds pulled from the original body parts, each piece of this kit fits precisely and securely, so you get a professional look and presentation.</p>
<p>Contrasting sharply with the exposed carbon fiber is almost shockingly-bright Pearl Effect Giallo paint. It’s a combination which is also on full display with the Forgiato Wheels, which match the mean look of the Huracan LP610-4 perfectly.</p>
<p>In addition to the amazing custom body kit, this Lamborghini is in absolutely amazing condition. It has just 3,372 miles on the odometer. The original owner ordered this with quite a few factory options like yellow brake calipers, navigation, electric heated seats, and a leather headliner/A-pillar covers.</p>
<p>Named after a fighting bull from Spain, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Lamborghini/Huracan" rel="nofollow">Lamborghini Huracan</a> is a monstrous supercar capable of amazing things on the track. It’s an all-motor car packing 602-horsepower, thanks to the hard-hitting 5.2-liter V12 engine. All that gets channeled through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission to the four corners through an all-wheel-drive system. That combined with the 3,424 pound curb weight makes this car rocket forward in a way you have to experience to truly appreciate.</p>
<p>While you certainly could buy another Lamborghini Huracan LP610-4, it won’t have a body kit like this. If you want to find out about getting this one, contact <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Fusion+Luxury+Motors">Fusion Luxury Motors</a> for details.</p>
