That insane engine is mated to a 4L80 transmission which helps to transfer the +900 horsepower to the one-off EVOD wheels. As has become custom in recent years for big classic cars, this thing is sitting on air suspension giving it a sleek and dominating presence when lowered to the ground. The suspension has three settings: 1 maximum low, 2 low but drivable, 3 lifts the nose up to allow for steep driveways and loading or unloading the car on to or from a trailer. "
