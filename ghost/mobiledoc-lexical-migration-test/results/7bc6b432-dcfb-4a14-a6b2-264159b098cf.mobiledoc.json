Upgrading locks, adding cameras, motion sensors, and additional lights are all good moves. You can use a steering wheel lock, although those can be defeated with relative ease. Even better, consider installing a kill switch. Hiding GPS trackers in the vehicle, even just some Apple AirTags, help finding it in the event someone steals it much easier."
