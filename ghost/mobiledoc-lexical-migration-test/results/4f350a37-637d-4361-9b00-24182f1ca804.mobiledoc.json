          "Automakers seem to be getting creative with the digital arts these days. That’s understandable, considering they can’t seem to figure out the chip shortage situation, so instead of pouring resources into that problem they’ll instead try to get everyone excited about “owning” NFTs or digital tokens of cars. That’s evidenced with the auctioning off of a 2023 Corvette Z06 by GM, which of course comes with an NFT version of the sports car since owning the real thing isn’t enough."

We’re not talking about the fact supposedly secure NFTs have been stolen in the past, although maybe that concerns some people. Instead, it’s the fact GM won’t provide a warranty for the print on the auction vehicle."

However, many who have taken the time to read the fine print for the auction have been shocked to learn the paint will be done by a third party, not GM, and so the automaker won’t be covering it under the usual warranty."

Although, it’s possible GM later decides to start offering Minted Green for the C8 lineup, which is possible considering the fine print only states the automaker won’t apply it to other production 2023 C8 Z06 Corvettes. Even if that does happen, this auctioned vehicle should still be an icon and hold its value well, especially as time marches on and deep-pocketed individuals feel nostalgic about it."
