The entry price for speed was steep with the GNX being almost twice as much as the Grand National. As you'll see in the Kenne Bell brochure, Grand National owners could buy performance additions for less than the GNX and surpass its performance. Sales of the GNX were limited to 547 cars. Production for the Grand National lasted 5 months longer than planned due to increased demand."
