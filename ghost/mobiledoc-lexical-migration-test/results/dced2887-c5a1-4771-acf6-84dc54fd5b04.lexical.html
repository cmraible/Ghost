<p>I’ve had my Apple Watch for about 24 hours now. Here are my initial thoughts as I’ve started to explore it:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I’m surprised how much I’ve missed being able to look at my wrist and see the time, rather than having to get my phone out.</li>
    <li>The health-tracking circles interface is <em>really</em> good: it’s a very powerful visual motivator to exercise a bit more, just from glancing at your watch. Liking that a lot.</li>
    <li>The only 3rd party app I’ve used extensively over the past 24 hours is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dark-sky-weather-radar-hyperlocal/id517329357?mt=8&uo=6&at=11lLfX&ct=">Dark Sky</a>. That app was conceptually built for the watch, truly.</li>
    <li>The Watch is <strong>NOT</strong> an iPhone on your wrist. The sooner you get your head round that idea (and it took me a few hours), the sooner you’ll start exploring what it actually is.</li>
    <li>That sapphire screen on the Watch? Beautiful. This is actually an item of jewellery as much as it is a piece of technology. I’m enjoying having it on my wrist, even when the screen if off (which it is the majority of the time.)</li>
    <li>I’ve been up since 6.40am, and I’m on 83% battery at 3.25pm.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m on toddler duty, so I haven’t had that much time to really play yet. More to come as I do.</p>
<h2 id="unboxing-the-apple-watch">Unboxing the Apple Watch</h2>
<p>Most of the unboxings I’ve seen have been of Apple Watch Sport. The Apple Watch comes in a rather different box:</p>

<p>It’s a square box in a square box. And it’s all as lovely, and finely crafted as you would expect. All the parts fit together perfectly, and slide apart smoothly.</p>

<p>The box has the contents clearly printed on the size, so the watch/band combos clearly have their own boxes. Has Apple ever had this many SKUs of a single product before?</p>

<p>The inner box pops open to reveal… a third box. It’s like pass the parcel.</p>

<p>Two tabs allow you to pull out the actual Watch box. (The power cable and brief documentation are sat underneath this. Incidentally, this is the first Apple product I can remember that <em>doesn’t</em> come with Apple logo stickers.)</p>
<p>The actually box itself reminds me of the plastic shell of the old-fashioned white iBook/MacBook. I really wouldn’t be surprised if it was an identical plastic. It’s a really substantial box – something that’s clearly designed to be kept and used, not just chucked away.</p>
<p>Pop it open:</p>

<p>And there’s the Watch.</p>
<p>All in all, it is clearly a <em>crafted</em> opening experience, designed to convince you that by stepping up to Apple Watch rather than Apple Watch Sport, you’ve bought a better quality product. And it’s compellingly tactile, too.</p>
<p>Pity the next step was rather ruined by it taking me a fair while to figure out how to actually turn Watch on…</p>

<p>Once I’d done that, and spent a while syncing it with my phone, this is how it looks on the wrist:</p>
