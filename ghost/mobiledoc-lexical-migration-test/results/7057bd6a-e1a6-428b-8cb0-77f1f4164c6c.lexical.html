<p>It wasn’t like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/last-2020-shelby-f-150-super-snake/">Shelby F-150 Super Snake</a> was some sort of pushover before, however the 2021 model year introduces a range-topping 775-horsepower on tap for a power boost of 5-hp, with the optional supercharger. If you think that isn’t something to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-carroll-shelby-racing-video/">scream about</a>, well you might want to tell some automotive publications which are making a huge deal about it. Still, 775-hp or 770-hp in an F-150 isn’t anything to sneeze at, so we love this truck.</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/why-shelby-gt350-getting-killed/">Shelby</a> hasn’t released torque figures for the new Super Snake, but it does say the Sport or 2-door version can sprint from 0-60 in just 3.45 seconds. It can also do the dash from 0-100-0 in 8.3 seconds, so we’d imagine its quarter-mile time is respectable.</p>

<p>The performance upgrades don’t stop there. A new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/strope-1968-dodge-charger/">adjustable suspension</a> features RideTech/FOX shocks, plus RideTech upper control arms, rear traction bars, and rear sway bar.</p>
<p>Not only is the new F-150 Super Snake a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">performance machine</a>, it’s packing some big tech upgrades. The 2021 features over-the-air updates for software. That’s handy since you don’t have to go to a dealer to have the ECU flashed periodically, which can mean better and more reliable performance.</p>

<p>What’s more, the interior has been fully redesigned. Among the many changes is more storage space, making the Shelby practical for everyday life. You also get the two-tone leather recovers, embroidered headrests, billet racing pedals, and other cool upgrades.</p>
<p>“Shelby American forever changed the perception of performance beginning with the Shelby Cobra, the Shelby version of the Ford Mustang pony car and then the muscle truck,” said Gary Patterson, president of Shelby American. “The 2021 model year Shelby F-150 Super Snake truck was created with that same DNA that made those vehicles so successful over the past six decades.”</p>

<p>Production of both the 2- and 4-door 2021 Shelby F-150 Super Snake will be limited to 300 units, so if you want one you might want to get serious about it.</p>
