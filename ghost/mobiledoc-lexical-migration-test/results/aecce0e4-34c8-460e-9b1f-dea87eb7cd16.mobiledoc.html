<hr>
<p>Some people are going to argue about whether the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-dodge-demon-race-classic-muscle-cars/">Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-redeye-hearse/">Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye</a> is the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-dodge-demon-race-classic-muscle-cars/">king of the drag strip</a>. Sure, to a lot of people the answer seems obvious, because there was so much hoopla surrounding the launch of the Demon, and rightfully so. But does that mean it’s a far better car than the Hellcat Redeye? Well, this race between these two modern Mopar muscle cars should prove insightful.</p>
<blockquote><em>See both these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/more-powerful-mopars/">Mopars</a> race, only they're both highly modified <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-redeye-races-dodge-demon/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Dodge has been very careful to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">not allow people to build Demon clones</a>. Parts unique to the muscle car can only be ordered by people who can prove they own one of the 3,300 out there. That just adds to the mystique of a Mopar most will never experience firsthand. With 840-horsepower and plenty of features aimed squarely at getting the car down the drag strip as quickly as possible, it seems to be the ultimate drag racer straight from the factory.</p>

<p>However, the Hellcat Redeye certainly is no pushover. It’s pushing 797-hp, which is pretty amazing. But it’s still not enough to match the Demon. We’ve seen these two muscle cars face off on the drag strip before, but those two specific vehicles <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-redeye-races-dodge-demon/">were both highly modified</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, numbers on a page don’t determine who wins a race. Both these cars look like they’re at least near enough to stock that mods shouldn’t decide a victory, although without being able to examine both it’s impossible to say for sure. After you see the results in the video, you might have an opinion about how stock each car truly is. However, driver skill shouldn’t be discounted in the least, since that can often decide a race.</p>
<p>Before you watch the video, which car do you think will win? How much of a difference between the two do you believe there will be?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-TZ9gg5sgM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
