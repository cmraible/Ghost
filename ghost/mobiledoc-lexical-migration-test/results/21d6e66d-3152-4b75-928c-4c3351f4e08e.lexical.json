We typically call vehicles like these muscle cars, but some cars prefer a different moniker despite similar performance and styling.

This engine produced around 325 in its prime, a prominent figure for a car whose prime was over 58 years ago. All that power is sent through a three-speed automatic transmission which combines drivability, comfort, and acceleration to make a great driving experience for nearly any enthusiast.",
