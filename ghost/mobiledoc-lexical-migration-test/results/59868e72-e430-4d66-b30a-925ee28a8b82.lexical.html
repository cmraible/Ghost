<p>This past week on <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a><em>, The Lever</em>‚Äôs staff discussed the Manchin-Schumer climate and health care bill. Even though corporate media has already decided that the bill will save the planet, we still had a few questions and concerns‚Ä¶ We also took questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lever Live </strong><strong>is publicly available for anyone to listen to and participate in. Just click the link below to find the replay on Callin.</strong></em></p>

<p>On this episode we answered some big questions:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ What did Joe Manchin get in exchange for making the deal?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ How many of Chuck Schumer's family members work for giant corporate interests?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ How much power does the Senate parliamentarian actually have?</p>
