The game is slated to release in December 2019. Here’s the rundown:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD</strong> is a not-so-serious adventure that brings together mechanics from Action RPG and RTS games. You’ll control <strong>Kofi</strong>, a weak, lazy and unlucky videogame character that will be followed by a group of interesting (and pathetic) characters aiding him to live a great adventure.<br>The videogame introduces a world of comic fantasy in which the characters are aware of being part of a videogame. Kofi is an RPG character that spends his days lazing around without leveling up. His game is a total mess and every character around him plays better.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Key Features:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>RTS troop control</strong>. Real-time group management. Control your own army.</li><li>Captains with&nbsp;<strong>special skills</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Find or buy weapons and equipment</strong>&nbsp;that allows you to improve your characters; multiple enemies with different qualities: find the best strategy to win.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>An adventure full of humor</strong>&nbsp;and exciting all the same that talks about a beginner adventurer’s road to self-improvement, and the importance of teamwork. With loads of surreal situations and unforgettable characters.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Explore a big map</strong>&nbsp;with different environments (forests, houses, caves, mountains, water areas…).
