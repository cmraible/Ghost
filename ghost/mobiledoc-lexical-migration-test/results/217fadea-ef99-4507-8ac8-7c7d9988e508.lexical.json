With that comes insight into the vast plethora o f vehicles out there waiting to be rescued from the clutches of old age and rot. This is something very clearly displayed in one video on the internet which showcases a property that appears to have not been kept in shape for decades. It seems like the kind of place with a lot of history, though most who saw it would be difficult to find, and the classic car collection it holds can only be described as intriguing in the most phenomenal way.",

Another  cool vehicle is the massive farm truck which sits in front of something that vaguely resembles a 1970 Camaro. Again, these cars are almost unidentifiable in their current condition which really makes us wonder why they were left three to begin with. Truly, this whole area gives a very off-putting and intriguing vibe which makes nearly everyone beg the question, what was this place?",
