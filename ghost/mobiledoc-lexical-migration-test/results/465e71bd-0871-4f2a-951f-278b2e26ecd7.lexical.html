<p>Sport trucks were all the rage in the early 1990s, but things got really quiet just after Y2K came and went. Fortunately, Dodge changed all that when it decided to cram the Viper's V10 engine under the hood of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fca-imagines-modern-dodge-rampage-pickup/">Ram</a> 1500 pickup resulting in the Ram SRT-10, and if these high-powered <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/trucks/">trucks </a>weren't special enough, there were also a handful of low-volume special editions offered over the course of the truck's three-year production run.</p>
<p>In 2005, one of those was the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/195341/2005-dodge-ram-srt-10-quad-cab-yellow-fever-special-466-of-only-500">Dodge Ram SRT-10 Yellow Fever</a> of which only 500 were built including 300 four-door models like this one.</p>
