<p><strong>A reminder that to</strong>day<strong> at 4pm ET (1pm PT) is our weekly Callin show, </strong><a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em><strong>Lever Live</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Itâ€™s no secret that corporate media outlets donâ€™t always have the best interest of their journalists at heart, spend valuable time and resources covering stories that distract from the issues that really matter and often work to reinforce the interests of their owners and sponsors. On todayâ€™s <em>Lever Live</em>, Andrew Perez and Mattthew Cunningham-Cook explore some of the most egregious recent examples of corporate journalism, including <em>Semafor</em>â€™s continual Chevron sponsored content, the <em>Washington Post</em>â€™s firing and hiring binge, and the recent <em>New York Times</em> coverage on transgender youth. Andrew and Matthew will discuss these stories and take questions from the audience live on-air.</p>
