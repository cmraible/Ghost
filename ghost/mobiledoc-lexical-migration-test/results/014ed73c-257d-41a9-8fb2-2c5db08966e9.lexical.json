One University, in particular, is about to show off to the world exactly what makes them such a wonderful option for anyone interested in restoring classic automobiles. In a surprising feat of technical ability, teamwork, and a great teacher, students are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to show the world the classic Mercedes-Benz they've been working on and when you see it you might just want to congratulate them.",

What started as a simple dream to restore an old Mercedes has now turned into a great representation of just what students can do when they're allowed to work on something important to them.
