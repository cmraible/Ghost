<p>With the top down, the completely new red leather interior is on full display. The factory heater and air conditioning work, and all the factory controls as well as gauges are included.

<p>To get this long car moving you need something powerful, and the 502ci GM Performance Big Block Crate V8 with 4bbl carb definitely qualifies for the job. This means you won’t struggle getting up the steepest hills or hitting freeway speeds on the on-ramp in this amazing ride.</p>
<p>Cadillac made the Series 62 from 1940 to 1964, and it was one of the most recognizable models to come out of the golden age of American car designs. The dramatic looks of the 1960 Series 62 came about for the 1959 model year when Cadillac designers added those large tail fins and rear fender skirts, creating a look which is still iconic today. Plenty of collectors clamor for these cars, making it a wise move to scoop this one before values climb once more. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Fast+Lane+Classic+Cars">Fast Lane Classic Cars</a> is offering you the opportunity to own this classic Caddie.</p>
