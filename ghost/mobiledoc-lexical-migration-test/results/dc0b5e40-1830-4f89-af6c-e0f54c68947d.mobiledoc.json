Ultimately, the driver ended up falling down some stairs as he tried to get away, thanks in no small part to a high-tech system the Atlanta Police Department is now using."

These days police have more at their disposal than just a radio. In Atlanta, they have a chopper to be an eye in the sky, which really helps with chases. But it’s what’s onboard that really makes a difference."

With law enforcement right on top of them, they jump out and make a run for it. The driver tries hopping a fence, realizing he can’t make it over in time, so he opts to dash across the street to some stairs, but he can’t manage those either. Stumbling down the steps, the guy falls on the ground and the chase is over."

They kept up and when it came down to a foot chase, they proved that law enforcement officers who are in shape make all the difference. Fortunately, the car thief wasn’t so quick or coordinated on his feet, bringing the whole situation to a hilarious close."
