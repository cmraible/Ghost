It needs work, but it's largely complete.</h3>

<p>When you're talking muscle cars, the 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 is among the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tom-macks-second-online-auction/">most desirable</a> of them all. We imagined that, by now, every last one of them that had been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-1969-mustang/">hiding in a barn somewhere</a> had been discovered.</p>

<p>We were pleasantly surprised to discover <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/414963406136178/">this fresh barn find</a> on Facebook Marketplace in Georgia. It appears to be complete and, quite honestly, in pretty good shape underneath all of that dust.</p>
<p>The ad states that the body is in good condition, but there is some rust underneath and it will need floorpans. Otherwise, though, this looks like a solid basis for a restoration project. We'd still be inclined to take a good long look at the front shock towers and the trunk.</p>

<p>The car still has its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/gt40-replica/">351 cubic inch V8</a>, claimed to be original, as well as its original transmission. Options include air conditioning, power steering, and disc brakes.</p>
<p> Everything is still there, too, so you won't spend a lot of time chasing after parts. Â Best of all, the car has a clean title, according to the seller.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, this can be yours for just $15,000, and the seller states that they're accepting offers. It'd be a great way to get into a Mach 1 project without breaking the bank, and, once fully restored, you might break even or possibly come out ahead on the deal.</p>
<p>Of course, if we found ourselves in a position to but it, we'd likely <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-shelby-gt500-high-price/">never let it leave our garage</a>. A '69 Mustang Mach 1 is the kind of car you hold on to forever.</p>
