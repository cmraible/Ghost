Deploy yourself into the combat arena and lay waste to your enemies with a plethora of normal, and not so normal, weaponry, such as baseball bats, disco balls, lawn mowers and chainsaws to make them bleed shards of metal and oil. Complete a series of objectives during each mission, such as clearing out enemy robots, destroying generators with an abundance of coal, escorting a minecart to its destination, robbing an alien bank vault or even destroying an entire factory with C4. There's never a dull moment and to increase the carnage, throw three of your mates into the fray for a four-player online game of mayhem!"

Unlocking one upgrade unlocks the next one and each has its own stats and abilities. Your secondary weapon consumes your yellow energy every time you use it and it can only be replenished if you use your main weapon, meaning you’ll have to balance weapon use during heated battles, otherwise you might end up being outgunned.

In addition, there is some light base customisation, allowing you to change up the interactive items in your base to something else like a military desk, cinema screen or even rubber ducky; these skins can be purchased with in-game currency or won after opening a loot box."

As soon as I highlight the menu, the game instantly crashes and I need to reboot the game.
