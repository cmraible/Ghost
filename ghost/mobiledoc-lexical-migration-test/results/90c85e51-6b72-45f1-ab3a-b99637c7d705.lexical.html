<p>Below is a commercial which will take certain people back, although Ford fans might want to either sit this one out or maybe grow up a little bit. That’s right, we have a bona fide 80s Camaro commercial. It’s actually for the super-hot <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1985-camaro-iroc-bat/">IROC-Z</a>, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> that was cooler than feathered bangs and all-white Pony sneakers. After watching it, you might find yourself listening to Duran-Duran or Twisted Sister for a few hours while wishing you had some Aqua Net on hand instead of so much toilet paper.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s people who hated masculinity declared with glee that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-camaro-runs-out-of-road-in-australia/">American muscle was dead</a>. It wasn’t really dead, it was just hibernating for a really long time. Thankfully that declaration turned out to be a jerk thing to say and Chevrolet helped prove that by launching the Camaro IROC-Z.</p>
<p>The whole point of naming the car after the International Race of Champions was to give the new range-topping Camaro model an image tied to Chevrolet’s racing exploits. It replaced the Z28, a model that before and after had been popular but had lost its luster (thank you, efficiency and emissions standards).</p>
<p>From 1985 through 1990 the IROC-Z was the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/you-have-to-stare-at-this-chevy-camaro-monstrosity/">top dog in the Chevy Camaro lineup</a>. And you can glean from this commercial that if you drove one your hand would perpetually be at the 11 and 1 positions on the steering wheel while women with enormous hairdos and excessive eyeliner would stare as if you were a juicy stake. The fact you would park on foggy streets at night in front of the Jazz Café certainly helped, naturally.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, there was a lot to be excited about with the rebirth of American muscle cars, particularly the IROC-Z. While the 215-horsepower and 275 lb.-ft. of torque squeezed out of the 305ci V8 is laughable by today’s standards, it was exciting for consumers who’d been subjected to some pretty ho-hum <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">cars</a> for years. Plus, the IROC-Z came with styling flairs like a deeper chin spoiler and ground effects, plus non-functional hood louvres.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the Chevy Camaro IROC-Z helped prove that if automakers churned out some <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/376605/american-muscle-car-barn-find">hot muscle cars</a> there was a hungry market for them. There’s no telling where we’d be today if American brands have completely given up on muscle back in the 80s.</p>
