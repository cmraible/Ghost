<p><a href="https://www.broadarrowauctions.com/vehicles/tj22_026/1951-buick-roadmaster-estate-wagon">Buick has</a> been a symbol in America for high class, wealth, and status for decades because of their brand image. Essentially, while other brands simply say they are all about style, the Buick manufacturing company backs up their claims. This is most prevalent with their classic models such as the Regal and even some older vehicles made in the 1950s. One particularly good example of that latter distinction comes in the form of a 1951 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon, which uses its good looks and high performance to be one of the most striking automobiles of the 1950s.</p>

It remains in remarkable unrestored and original condition. The Buick shows 42,921 miles, and it remains to be a very solid car. Its interior is retains all of the original upholstery, and the charm of the whole car is undeniable.</p>
