It’s debatable how much of a long-term impact the cameras have had on crime. However, Hillsborough County has been using its Eye on Crime cameras since 2010, so this is no new experiment. And the numbers of crimes solved by the video footage is a testament to their effectiveness. So perhaps the difference is in how the technology is used and not the technology itself."

For example, many new vehicles are sold with a GPS tracker installed in the factory, but owners don’t realize this and might never activate the service, even after their car is stolen. At the same time, some thieves are now carrying signal suppressors to keep the trackers from broadcasting. There is no perfect solution to car theft, but these cameras seem to be helping."
