<p>When you’re a celebrity like Richard Rawlings, you’re privy to information and events the rest of us could only dream about. That includes seeing car collections which have been hidden away for a long time. As you already know, in this Gas Monkey adventure the man is checking out a collection of 40-plus cars holed up in an abandoned factory in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>

<p>This collection is full of Lincolns, Mercuries, and Fords. In other words, if you’re a Blue Oval fan, this will be pretty exciting. However, there are some GM products as they dig deeper, like a ’59 Cadillac limousine once used by the governor of Alabama and a first-year Oldsmobile Toronado. There are also some old Dodge trucks. For good measure, there are also a couple of Audis and some train cars as well as engines. The man who owns the collection comes from an old railroad family, explaining why all the trains.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting vehicles in the collection is a motor home of sorts designed by the guy’s father in 1962. He thought of the idea after taking his family in a station wagon to Yellowstone National Park and back. It was made out of a Ford Econoline with a custom-build body. The styling is very much of the era, giving people sort of an Airstream vibe.</p>

<p>Before he stops at the abandoned factory, Rawlins first does some shopping in Louisiana. For some reason he buys a bunch of Mardi Gras beads. He makes some other stops, like getting dinner at a music club and grabbing breakfast at a Waffle House. If you want to just start with the cars, skip to about 12:50.</p>
