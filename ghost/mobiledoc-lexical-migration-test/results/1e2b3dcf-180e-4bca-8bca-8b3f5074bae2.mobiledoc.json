Even though the build process is confirmed as John Cena and one of the builders took a ride spinning around the track like a tornado. Speaking of wind, the body of the car was made to be as aerodynamic as possible featuring a lot of stylistic cues from Pontiac's banshee concept, at least that’s what it looks like."

Some of the cooler parts of the vehicle are the glass roof and cockpit hatch which resembles that of a fighter jet. Indeed, some of the world's greatest automobiles have been built in the image of airplanes and this car is no exception to that rule. Regardless of its inspiration, the InCenarator is certainly one of the most unique and cool custom cars built in modern times."
