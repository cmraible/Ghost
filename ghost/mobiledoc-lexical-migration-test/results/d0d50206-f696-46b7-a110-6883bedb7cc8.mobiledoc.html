<p>Ever since the Chevrolet Corvette was introduced new for the 1953 model year, plenty of interesting stories have collected over the decades. When it came to the 1969 Corvette model line, production was delayed at GM due to a parts strike which gave the 1970 model a shortened production run. In fact, a total of 17,316 examples were built, but only 1,287 of them were actual LT1 cars. With that said, Crown Concepts is excited to offer the opportunity to own this rare numbers-matching <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/417/1970-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1970 Chevy Corvette Convertible LT1</a>.</p>

<p>It was a long time ago this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-dodge-challenger-3/">1970 Dodge Challenger</a> R/T was made, 50 to be exact, so you’d expect by now it would have accumulated all kinds of rip-roaring miles worth of fun. Expectations are set so they can be smashed by someone, and in this case it was an owner who saw the value of this classic American muscle car. They had the restraint to limit use to 61,000 actual miles, According to <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a>. But that’s just the beginning of what makes this Mopar a highly collectible and ultimately desirable vehicle.</p>

<p>Studebaker only produced its Corvette-fighting Avanti sports coupe for two years before the car's South Bend, Indiana assembly plant closed in 1963. For many cars, this would have been the end of the line, but in fact, this design and the Avanti name were resurrected in 1965 through 1985 as the Avanti II and from 1986 through 2006 as the Avanti. Marking the end of the line for the original Studebaker-based model, this <a href="https://www.artandspeed.com/vehicles/629/1985-avanti-touring-coupe?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1985 Avanti II</a> has survived the years in excellent condition in the care of a former Studebaker employee, and it's currently being sold through <a href="https://www.artandspeed.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Art & Speed Classic Car Gallery</a></p>
