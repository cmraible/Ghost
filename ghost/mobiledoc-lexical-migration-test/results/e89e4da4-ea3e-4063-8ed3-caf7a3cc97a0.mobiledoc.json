To compete in NASCAR, Ford had to build at least 500 production cars with this engine, and the Ford Mustang Boss 429 was born. This engine was topped with an aluminum intake and Holley four-barrel carburetor to produce what is commonly believed to be a severely underrated power output of 375 horsepower."

In addition to the Marti Report, this Boss is also being sold with its original bill of sale and original build sheets. It will be hard finding a 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 429 that is as original and complete as this fully restored Mustang, which is accurate down to the mag wheels and Goodyear Polyglas tires."
