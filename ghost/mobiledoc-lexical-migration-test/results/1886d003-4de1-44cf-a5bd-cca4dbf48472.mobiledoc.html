<p>This Rabbit GTi was sold first Gallipolis, Ohio at Riverside Volkswagen in '82. In 1983, the car made its way to Old Lyme, Connecticut where a Callaway Turbosystems Stage II turbocharger was installed. As recent as 2013, the dealership that originally sold the car purchased it from the original owner. The car has enjoyed the road some but only has 19,000 actual miles on the clock.</p>
<p>The exterior of this retro Rabbit is sprayed in Cashmere White (LE9C), and it with a color-matched front air dam. A red stripe adds a contrasting red stripe to break up the exterior. Other exterior features include black impact bumpers, fender flares, stripes, and window trim. Since the car returned to the dealer, the front bumper has been repainted. The factory 14-inch snowflake wheels with custom red pinstripes framing the center sit on all four corners and are wrapped with Dean Equua LSi rubber (185/60).</p>
<p>Powering the car is a turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-four backed by a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission with a 'Street Comp' clutch. The Callaway turbocharger kit was rated at 200-horsepower, and that includes the thermostatic control, intercooler, Turbonetics wastegate, exhaust system, heat shielding, ducting, ignition-retard system, and Callaway valve cover. Handling on this car comes from a standard sport-tuned suspension and anti-sway bars in the front and rear. Stopping power comes from ventilated front disc brakes. In the paperwork provided from Callaway Turbosystems, it mentions the addition of an aftermarket front sway bar and lower stress bar. In July 2019, work was performed on the car such as a brake fluid flush, a valve adjustment, valve cover gasket replacement, shocks, and shift bushings. </p>
<p>Open the doors to reveal a stunning red velour interior. Vinyl door panels and the carpeting are also red. An AM/FM cassette radio is embedded inside along with instrumentation that includes an 85-mph speedometer, 7k-rpm tachometer, temperature, and fuel-level gauges. Off to the right of the gauges is a VDO boost gauge, and a three-gauge pod can be found in the center console allow monitoring of important vital signs including voltage and oil temperature. More interior highlights include floor mats that feature the Rabbit logo, a golf ball shifter, an AM/FM cassette radio, a four-spoke steering wheel with the GTI logo smack in the middle, and a rear defroster with a wiper on the hatch glass.</p>
<p>The sale of this MK1 Volkswagen GTi also comes with service records, window sticker, purchasing documents, literature from the factory and Callaway, and spare parts and accessories. The car has both a clean Carfax report and Pennsylvania title.</p>
