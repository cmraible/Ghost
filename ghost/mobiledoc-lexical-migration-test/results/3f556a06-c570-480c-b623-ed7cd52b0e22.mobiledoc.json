          " The Escort, perhaps one of the most unfortunate names in automotive history, doesn’t enjoy a stellar reputation on this side of the pond. It’s not that people think the little economy car was a bad vehicle, just that it certainly didn’t live up to its glamorous namesake. For Americans, it’s more than a little amusing to think a British royal drove one back in the 90s, especially the highly fashionable Princess Diana. Now, that famous car is heading for the auction block, so you could take the pricess’ Escort out for a night on the town."

Instead of tooling around in a luxurious choice like a Rolls-Royce, Range Rover, or a Jaguar the common Brit could only dream of owning, she chose far more down-to-earth vehicles."

Many a time, she was photographed in the driver’s seat with Prince William and Harry in the backseat. That’s enough to get some potential buyers worked up, so this ride could go for what normally would be a ridiculous sum. Provenance, of course, matters to collectors."
