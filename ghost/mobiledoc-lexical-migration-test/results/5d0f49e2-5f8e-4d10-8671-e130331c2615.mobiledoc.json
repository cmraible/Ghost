If you’ve been hoping to get into the practice then you know what’s up and have probably seen a few crazy projects as a result. However, for those looking to run in Baja-style competition without having to build the truck themselves, there’s a pretty neat option available to them. What’s the catch? It’s going to cost them $295,000."

An impressive 47 degree approach angle, followed up immediately by a 37 degree exit angle, lets you know that you’ll be able to scale pretty much any obstacle that comes your way. On top of that trucks got 37 inch BF good rich tires, enough to really make an impression in the traction department. Overall, it’s unclear how the Bronco will compete with other experienced drivers behind their own wheels but it’s probably safe to say this is a great option for anyone looking to have some fun."
