<h3 id="built-from-scratch-this-ferrari-f40-replica-is-not-a-kit-car-or-a-terrible-toyota-mr2-project">Built from scratch, this Ferrari F40 replica is not a kit car or a terrible Toyota MR2 project.</h3>
<p>The Ferrari F40 is an automotive legend that sets enthusiasts' hearts racing when mentioned. This iconic supercar was the last to be signed of by Enzo Ferrari himself and encompasses everything he thought a Ferrari road car should be. Today good examples can fetch over $1 million, so what do you do if you can’t afford one? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC5wbslK0eM">Build one</a> of course!</p>
<p>Meet Michael Johanssons, a gentleman who adores the mighty Ferrari F40, but like many of us, can’t quite stretch to the vast sums the supercar demands today. Instead of giving up on his dream of F40 ownership, Michael has been busy creating his own Ferrari since 2005.</p>

<p>While not made from the same exotic materials as a Ferrari, the replica is pretty accurate to the real thing. Michael started by creating a steel tubular frame to serve as the car’s skeleton, then he fashioned the bodywork out of sheetmetal to create the iconic supercar silhouette.</p>
<p>The whole project has been built from scratch with no donor chassis involved. Michael states that he could have found a mid-engined car, such as a Toyota MR2, to base the F40 replica on, but then the proportions of the car would be wrong. The build process becomes even more fascinating when he reveals that the only tools used for fabricating the body was a hammer and a homemade metal bending machine. Originally, measurements used for this 1:1 scale Ferrari came from a model, but Michael has since had contact with the real thing to verify his work.</p>
<p>Not much is shared about the powertrain of this car other than it uses a gearbox from a diesel Audi A4 — let’s hope that’s all it shares with the A4, and not its diesel engine!</p>
<p>It’s an impressive project whichever way you look at it, and it’s fair to say that Michael is far closer to owning a Ferrari F40 than most of us.</p>
