Playing a major role on the hit tv show, Top Gear, he made a name for himself by being surprisingly competent despite his goofy demeanor. However, there were a lot of fun crashes that took audiences by surprise when Hammond inevitably survived with a smile on his face. Recently, a video has come out showing the reaction to some of his best crashes and it is hilarious.",

Of course, there’s also quite a few videos out there depicting crashes that happen well He and the team were driving boats, not exactly their specialty.",

One of the scarier crashes that the man has ever stood stand was one in which he drove a Remak off the side of the Clift by accident. It’s easy to see that some of these wrecks were a little staged but when Richard took that dive, it was clear that nobody had planned for such a thing to have happened. Oversteering off of the corner, Richard‘s car flew off of the road and fell over 300 feet before landing upside down and shortly catching on fire. Thankfully, he was completely fine, except for the super broken leg, and escaped with his life. Over the years, the car icon has been through a lot of insane injuries along his journey to become one of the most highly respected people within the car community. It is that which made him the man he is today.",
