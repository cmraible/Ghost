<p>Classic trucks are some of the coolest platforms to start building the hotrod, offroader, or show car of any enthusiast's dreams as they sport plenty of performance and style for a reasonable price. That last part can be almost entirely attributed to the incredibly high production numbers of nearly every classic Chevy, Dodge, and Ford pickup truck. These utility vehicles were the heroes of their generation as they allowed everyone from farmers to tradesmen to get their work done. Nowadays, you'll be lucky to find them in good condition, but they can be pretty cheap to restore, and most are still running even after decades of sitting. So, of course, this leads us to the topic of this article, a massive field of seemingly forgotten classic trucks in various states of aging.</p>

<p>Towards the entrance, you'll notice a classic Chevrolet Apache pickup truck from what appears to be the 1930s or 1940s. The fun certainly doesn't stop there as a few square bodies are scattered throughout the property, which hosts plenty of other classic pickups. Apart from the impartial bodies, simply because there are so many, you've also got a first-generation Chevrolet C10. This is a pretty fantastic sight as this design era is widely regarded as the beginning of a new trend in the truck world of thoughtful design and outstanding performance. Finally, the truck has been rediscovered after being shrouded in overgrown weeds and grass for what must have been decades by now.</p>
<p>After watching these explorers search the property, we are treated to seeing a few more trucks from the early days of automotive design. One particular truck looks like everyone's favorite tow truck, Tow Mater, because of the body style and massive amount of rust. Whoever owns this lot has their hands on some of the most exciting vehicles to ever come off the Chevy assembly line. Finally, the field has a ton of hotrod cars, including some race cars like a heavily modified 1969 Ford Torino Cobra Jet Drag Pack. This great car was a born and bred race car, which adds to this incredible collection of classic American automobiles.</p>
