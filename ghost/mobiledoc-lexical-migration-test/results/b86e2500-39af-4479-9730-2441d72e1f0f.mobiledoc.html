<p>Beginning production back in the late 1920s after buying Ace Fours, the Indian motorcycle was born. The models made between 1938 and 1942 are more popular with collectors because of their preferred crank/bearing setup. This example from Worldwide Auctioneers is a <a href="https://worldwideauctioneers.com/listings/kannenberg-motorcycle-collection/1942-indian-four-with-sidecar/">1942 Indian Four With Sidecar</a> that would make a perfect addition to your <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/keanu-reeves-motorcycle-collection/">motorcycle collection</a>.</p>

<p>For a few years in the 1940s, Indian gave the bike some even better changes than before, like a skirted fender livery in 1940, and then in 1941, the bikes went to a fully sprung suspension in the front and rear. After the start of WWII, Indian went into wartime production mode, and the 1942 was one of the lowest production Indians during the time. Only 700 examples were made, and this particular example is believed to <a href="https://worldwideauctioneers.com/listings/kannenberg-motorcycle-collection/1942-indian-four-with-sidecar/">be the last one ever produced</a>. It is also fitted with a sidecar and Art Deco fenders.</p>
