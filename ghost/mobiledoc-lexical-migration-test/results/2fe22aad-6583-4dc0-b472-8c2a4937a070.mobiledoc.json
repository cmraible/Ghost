Sadly, this affects areas like Winchester, especially when they have a sweet, sweet Shelby just sitting there and thieves think that means it’s up for grabs. We’re not blaming the victim here, but we’re wondering just what kind of security they had, because we keep seeing thieves easily break into the key safe so they can just drive off with whatever."

After all, the Shelby GT500 packs a muscular 760-horsepower, so it’s one spicy pony and would easily outgun just about any police cruiser out there. Unless the Winchester Police Department has a Dodge Hellcat Redeye hiding in its fleet, there’s no way they could chase this thing down in a pursuit. However, they have the might of Motorola or the radio, plus stop sticks cops seems to struggle with deploying, etc. We hope they catch them, but if some crazy chase ensues beforehand that could be interesting and also dangerous, but entertaining."
