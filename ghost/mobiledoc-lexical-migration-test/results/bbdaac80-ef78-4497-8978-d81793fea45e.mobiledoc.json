However, if you’re looking to get the littles interested in cars, a new Lego Ferrari “Build and Race” interactive attraction at Legoland California could be the ticket. It allows kids to create and race their very own Lego Ferrari. And we hear adults can participate, you know, to help the kids."

If that’s not enough to get you just as excited as the kids, well you’re probably not a Ferrari fan at all. You can even sit inside this model, so it’s not one of those look but don’t touch kind of things."
