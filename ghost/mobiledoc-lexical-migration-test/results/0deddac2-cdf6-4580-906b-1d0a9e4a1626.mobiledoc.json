It was based on a heavy ladder frame and featured the Duesenberg’s famous straight-8 cylinder engine mated to a 3-speed transmission. This iconic powertrain was reportedly able to push the incredibly long wheelbased car to speeds in excess of 100-mph. Coachwork was provided by numerous independent coachbuilders, but one of the most luxurious was built by Rollston. "

Chassis No. 2611 was then featured at the 1936 New York Auto Show as the most expensive car on display at $17K. It was later bought by then president of Coca-Cola, Conkey Whitehead. Later, it was purchased by Charles Kyner and the jazz musician kept it for 46 years. Richard Dicker of the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired the car from the estate of Kyner after he died and the car was restored in 1990."
