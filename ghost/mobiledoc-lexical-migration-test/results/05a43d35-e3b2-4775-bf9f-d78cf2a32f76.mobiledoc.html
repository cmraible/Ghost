<p>The Plymouth Fury was produced by the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-cuda-races-1969-chevelle/">Plymouth</a> division of the Chrysler Corporation from 1956 to 1989. The Fury was introduced as a sporty, premium-priced model designed to showcase the line, with the intent to draw consumers into showrooms.</p>
<p>The word "fury" denotes a type of anger, inspired by the Furies, mythological creatures in Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman mythology.</p>
<p>The Fury was a sub-series of the Plymouth Belvedere from 1956 through 1958. It was sold only as an off-white 2-door hardtop coup√© with gold anodized aluminum trim in 1956, and 1957. The Fury had a special interior, bumper wing-guards and a V8 engine with twin 4-barrel carburetors.</p>
<p>The car was introduced in 1956 with a 303 V8 and had sharply peaked tail fins, a Cadillac-like logo, and typical '50s styling.</p>
<p>Curtis Redgap wrote about the introduction of the FX Fury at the February Speed Weeks in Daytona:</p>
<p>"As expected the big 1956 Chrysler 300B blew everything else off the beach, including the stock models of the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird. It set a two way record of 139.373 miles an hour. ... Then the driver, Mr. Phil Walters, took the Fury slowly down to the start of the timing lane. ... It was screaming over the sand so fast, that to look at it was almost like a distorted picture. You couldn't quite focus fully on it. It was moving like the wind! ... With a resounding boom and a flash of gold, it was gone, the engine defiantly pounding out its deep belly staccato tune with bass notes better than any musical orchestra. The timers acted like they were in slow motion. Finally ... the numbers rolled over. ... 143.596 miles an hour! The fastest Plymouth ever built in history. And even faster than the 300B.</p>
<p>... Then the big Fury started back. ... About 1/2 way through the run up, approaching the timing lane, the engine started to die. ... It broke the timer at 129.119 miles an hour. ... A defective fuel cap had caused a vacuum in the fuel tank and starved the engine for gas. The next day, with a new cap, and of course without NASCAR sanctioning, the big Fury roared through the timer on a third run at 147.236 miles an hour. On the return trip, it broke the lights at 149.124 miles an hour!"</p>
<p>"For collectors, the great gold-and-white rockets of 1956-1958 have appeal not only as the first but also as clearly the best Furys. Whether these high-strung machines are going to be permanently happy on unleaded gasoline is an unanswered question, but they'll need lots of fuel in any case" (Auto Editors of Consumer Guide).</p>
