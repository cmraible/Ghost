<p>Included in his collection are recreations of Scooby-Doo's Mystery Machine, the original Batmobile, and the Wagon Queen Family Truckster from National Lampoon's Vacation. For Christmas, he plans on hosting a drive-through holiday display themed after "Christmas Vacation," which will include Cousin Eddie's RV among other displays, including Santa's sleigh, seen here, built on a 1979 Jeep Cherokee frame.</p>
<p>Lawyer also plans on loaning out some of the vehicles for charity and children's events so that folks have a chance to get up close and personal with these amazing machines. Even though he's only been collecting cars for about five years, it's clear that Lawyer is hooked, with no end in sight.</p>
