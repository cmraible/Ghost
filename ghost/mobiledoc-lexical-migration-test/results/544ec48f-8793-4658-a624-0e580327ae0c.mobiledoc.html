<p>When it comes to satirizing corporate media and the billionaire oligarchs who run it, no TV series has done it as effectively as <em>Succession</em>. Its depiction of the dysfunctional ultra-wealthy is at times hilarious but also terrifying, sheerly due to the immense power they wield. </p>
<p>On todayâ€™s episode, Rivka, Frank and David do a deep-dive on the series finale. Now that the show has ended, will it be entered into the great television pantheon? What were some of the most shocking and stand-out moments? And is there anything they wish the <em>Succession</em> finale had done differently?</p>
