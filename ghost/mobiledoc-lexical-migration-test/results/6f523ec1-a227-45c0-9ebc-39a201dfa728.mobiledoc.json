This car isn't a total sleeper, though, thanks to its massive hood scoops, rally wheels and a black rear stripe to match the vinyl top."

Both of these were installed in a way, though, that they don't ruin the car's original look with the tachometer mounted on top of the steering column and the JVC head unit attached under the dash; the car's factory radio is still in place!"
