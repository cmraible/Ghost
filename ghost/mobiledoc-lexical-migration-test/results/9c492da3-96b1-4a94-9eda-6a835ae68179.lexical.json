While the police were once respected among communities of law-abiding citizens and feared by criminals, the institutions to protect and serve have become a laughing stock. Whether this is because of the cops themselves, the recent lack of respect for law enforcement, or just a lack of funding, it's clear that the police require a total brand overhaul. So the first step on the journey to reclaim their reputation for catching the bad guys and saving the day is to reshape their image; this might be the perfect way to start. There's more than just ",
