You are given these Soul Cards throughout each level and each card represents a weapon you can use to defeat enemies. The cards can also be discarded to use a traversal ability; for example, the pistol gives you a double jump, the SMG gives you a stomp, the rifle gives you an air dash, etc. This invokes the same kind of feeling as a gun fight in an action movie as someone throws away their empty guns, only to pull out more guns to continue the fight. Tying your ability to fight with your platforming abilities fills the game with adrenaline pumping action and satisfying split second decisions."

I got the best times on every level, found every collectable and beat every challenge level and a part of me kind of regrets doing that. Not because the game is bad or anything, far from it; it’s because this game has way too many levels. Not including the challenge stages, there are around one hundred levels in this game and while I was still having fun, I found that the game was starting to overstay its welcome about seventy levels in. If someone like me who plays MMOs in their spare time (games which are notorious for having too much stuff to do in them) starts to feel like there's too much stuff in the game, you know you have a problem."

Its primary fire can be used to rocket jump your way up walls and across large gaps while its discard ability is a grapple hook. Once you get something that gives you ridiculous traversal options like that, the only thing you can really do to hide collectables is to just stick them at the very top of the level and see if the player can reach that high."
