Ford racing cams, long tube headers, an intake manifold, etc. push performance even higher. Paired with a GT500 TR6060 6-speed manual transmission, Matt says the powertrain is smooth and not too much for the chassis."

Those shocks are in the backseat area, which you can see through the glass, and it’s pretty crazy."
