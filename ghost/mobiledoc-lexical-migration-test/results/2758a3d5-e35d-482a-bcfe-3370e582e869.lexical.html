<p>As we previously announced, tonight at 7:30 pm ET (4:30 pm PT), the <em>Daily Poster</em> team will be exploring the political ramifications of the 1984 blockbuster <em>Ghostbusters</em>. But because of news developments, we will also be discussing the state of the Democrats’ so-called Build Back Better bill — and for both topics, we will be joined by a very special guest: <a href="https://tcfrank.com/">celebrated political analyst Thomas Frank</a>.</p>
<p>As we have noted in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-outer-limits-of-corporate-politics/">our coverage</a> of the battle to pass the Democrats’ economic agenda, the shrinking of the once-ambitious climate change and social safety net legislation reveals the far-reaching influence of corporate interests in the party. So what’s left in the bill, and where do we go from here?</p>
<p>In honor of Halloween, after we discuss the fate of the Build Back Better bill, we will turn our attention to a very different topic: <em>Ghostbusters</em>. The film is a beloved classic because it deftly intertwined screwball comedy and supernatural horror. But it also illustrated how the era’s conservative economic ideologies were often amplified by seemingly apolitical products like movies and TV shows — a development that still reverberates today.</p>
<p>You can read Sirota and Frank’s writing on <em>Ghostbusters <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PBpztbG9EQAC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=sirota+ghostbusters+environmental&source=bl&ots=sOkBMd7l5o&sig=cgOquqvTbw2r-uylIwxjzleFTx8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=riQQU9HvD6v40wGBsYGICA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=sirota%20ghostbusters%20environmental&f=false">here</a></em> and <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/02/baby_boomer_humors_big_lie_ghostbusters_and_caddyshack_really_liberated_reagan_and_wall_street/">here</a>. As they note, the film is all about a wildly incompetent municipal government forced to rely on for-profit corporate mercenaries to protect the city from a ghost invasion, and then those mercenaries must save the city after a heavy-handed EPA official creates a disaster.</p>
<p>We’ll be digging deep into these subjects and much more in tonight’s live chat, exclusively for paying subscribers, who can participate in the discussion, post questions, and watch a replay after the event.</p>
