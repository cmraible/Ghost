<h3 id="colombia%E2%80%99s-new-president-promises-to-combat-climate-change">Colombia‚Äôs New President Promises To Combat Climate Change</h3>
<p>Last Sunday, voters in Colombia ‚Äî long a conservative bastion ‚Äî elected their first Leftist president, an economist and former guerrilla fighter named Gustavo Petro. Alongside Petro, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/19/world/colombia-election-results#gustavo-petro-colombia-election">historic voter turnout</a> elected Francia M√°rquez as the country‚Äôs first Afro-Colombian vice president. As an environmental activist, M√°rquez has played a vital role in defending collectively owned Afro-Colombian lands from <a href="https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/francia-marquez/">extractivism</a>, leading to the removal of illegal multinational miners from her community. M√°rquez will now lead a new <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/colombias-first-black-president-francia-marquez-vows-reduce-inequality-rcna34518">ministry for equality</a> and organize for women‚Äôs rights and access to education and health care.</p>
<p>Together, Petro and M√°rquez have a vision to reorganize Colombia‚Äôs economy to combat climate change and dismantle its dependence on fossil fuels. Alongside proposals for a publicly controlled health system, guaranteed work, and higher taxes on the wealthy, Petro has <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/06/20/colombias-new-president-gustavo-petro-pledges-to-keep-fossil-fuels-in-the-ground/">pledged</a> to phase out new fossil fuel production. Seeking to form a <a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/colombia-candidate-petro-seeks-global-anti-oil-bloc-repeat">global anti-oil bloc</a>, Petro and M√°rquez‚Äôs win makes possible a pathway to climate and economic justice for Colombians.</p>

<h3 id="los-angeles-elects-first-abolitionist-city-council-member">Los Angeles Elects First Abolitionist City Council Member</h3>
<p>On June 17, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-20/los-angeles-leads-san-francisco-progressive-election-california">Eunisses Hernandez</a>, who ran on a <a href="https://eunisses.com/">platform</a> prioritizing affordable housing, alternatives to incarceration, and social protections for working Angelenos, won a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. Hernandez is a co-founder of <a href="https://ladefensa.org/who-we-are/">La Defensa</a>, an organization that has fought against mass incarceration and advocated for new visions of public safety. And in 2020, Hernandez co-chaired the successful Measure J, a tremendous <a href="https://ceo.lacounty.gov/measure-j-background/#:~:text=On%20November%203%2C%202020%2C%20the,development%2C%20job%20training%2C%20small%20business">ballot initiative</a> that is moving millions of dollars into community and youth services. Hernandez brings an abolitionist ethic that sets out to replace carceral thinking with new visions of community care and safety.</p>
<p>Nearby in the L.A. Eastside, labor organizer Hugo Soto-Mart√≠nez <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-20/los-angeles-leads-san-francisco-progressive-election-california">has</a> campaigned on fewer cops and more rights for those experiencing homelessness. He <a href="https://twitter.com/HugoForCD13/status/1539399222738358272">led</a> his primary race in council district 13 on June 21, moving into the general election this November with strong momentum.</p>
<h3 id="maryland-apple-workers-win-union">Maryland Apple Workers Win Union!</h3>
<p>This past week, workers at an Apple store in Towson, Maryland, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/18/technology/apple-union-maryland.html">voted to unionize</a>, making the location the first in the company‚Äôs 270-plus stores to unionize amid surging labor organizing nationwide. Towson employees recently shared what the union means to them and how they overcame company union-busting tactics in a video produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/moreperfectus/status/1537826938965868545?s=21&t=NQ0zOe_26obElatf2cbLww">More Perfect Union</a>.</p>
<p>Towson Apple workers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/first-apple-store-union-towson/">received support</a> from organizers in an Atlanta store whose unionization efforts earlier this month were derailed by aggressive corporate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23041632/apple-hires-anti-union-lawyers-littler-mendelson-union-fight-cwa">union-busting</a><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmymy/leaked-audio-apple-vp-gives-apple-store-workers-anti-union-speech">strategies</a>.</p>
<p>The union win in Towson will likely inspire other Apple employees across the country. Already, Apple workers in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-together-solidarity-union-organizing/">New York City</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/18/technology/apple-union-maryland.html">Louisville stores</a> are building support to organize union drives, and Atlanta workers are planning to revive their efforts.</p>

<p>After all the difficult news this week, take a moment to read Lucille Clifton‚Äôs poem on possibility, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58816/blessing-the-boats">blessing the boats</a> (at St. Mary‚Äôs)‚Äù:</p>
<p><em>may the tide</em></p>

<p><em>carry you out</em></p>
<p><em>beyond the face of fear</em></p>
<p><em>may you kiss</em></p>
<p><em>the wind then turn from it</em></p>
<p><em>certain that it will</em></p>

<p><em>water waving forever</em></p>
