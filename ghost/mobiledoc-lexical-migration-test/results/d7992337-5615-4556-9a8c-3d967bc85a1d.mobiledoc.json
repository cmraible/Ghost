This includes red accents such as the door mirrors as well as matte black 19-inch wheels, and the Launch Edition models were only offered in three colors including the Nocturnal Black shown on this example. These cars also featured an exclusive red leather interior as well as a serialized dash plaque. Being no. 928 of the 1,500 Launch Editions made, this one has just 2,500 miles showing on the odometer.

Just in case the stock 335 horsepower wasn't good enough, though, this one packs some tasteful modifications such as an engine computer tune and an increased-diameter exhaust system that is estimated to bump the Supra's output up to somewhere between 450-500 hp. With its added power, this Supra Launch Edition will surely surprise anything it goes up against."
