It also revolutionized the way front ends were designed with its radiator being completely hidden behind horizontal louvers. Other features included a concealed fuel filler door and variable-speed windshield wipers. While these items may seem like small enhancements, at a time when vacuum operated windshield wipers were standard, it was a big deal to be able to see and accelerate at the same time during a rainstorm. However ahead of the competition a car is, it hardly ever remains that way and as such today the very few Cords that remain are no longer ground-breaking vehicles. With this in mind there are few other cars that are as deserving of the ",

Likewise a custom-made gray leather upholstery does not stand out as un-original either but tastefully adds a modern touch to a classic design. Under hood and underpinning modifications to the originally front wheel drive car were more extreme. For power, a new GM crate engine topped with an FI Tech fuel injection system was installed longitudinally and is backed by a TH350 automatic transmission. Underpinnings include a leaf sprung 1980s GM rear end and a Jaguar XJ6 front suspension. This is an absolutely stunning car that is sure to draw attention on the street as well as at the show.
