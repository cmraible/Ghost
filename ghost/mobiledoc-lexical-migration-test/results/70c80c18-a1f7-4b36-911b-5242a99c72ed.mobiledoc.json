          "The Bulldog was designed to promote what Aston’s new engineering facility in Newport Pagnell was capable of. Built with the aim of becoming the world’s fastest road car, the vehicle was powered by a twin-turbocharged 5.3-liter V8 producing 600 hp and 500lb ft of torque. It is said that the engine was actually capable of 700 hp, but was detuned for added reliability."

The alien shape was a means to propel the car to a targeted 237mph top speed. The Bulldog only ever managed 192mph – still hugely impressive, yet some 45 mph short."

The only functioning car created was then sold in 1983 for £130,000. That, it seemed, was the end of Aston Martin’s foray into the world of mid-engined cars. It would take a further 40 years before development continued."

Presented with a blank sheet of paper and a pen, he’s then asked to sketch what he might expect the car to look like. While not designed by Towns, the 1985 MG EX-E concept car does share a resemblance to the rough drawing."
