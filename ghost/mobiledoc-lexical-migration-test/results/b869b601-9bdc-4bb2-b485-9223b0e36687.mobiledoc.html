<p>As the reigning triple World Touring Car Champions, Cyan Racing is taking a victory lap by giving the enthusiast community the Volvo P1800 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tyler-hoover-sings-praises-for-restomods/">restomod we certainly deserve</a>. We love some good restomod <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/motorweeks-retro-review-muscle/">American muscle cars</a>, as do quite a few of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/swedish-mopar-collection/">Swedes</a> by the way, but something unexpected and well-executed like this is a welcome treat. After all, most people don’t associate Volvo with a need for speed, especially now the Swedish automaker is looking to kill such bad habits. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun in a classic Volvo and the P1800 has the right looks for just such a project.</p>

<p>Cyan Racing decided to resurrect the 60s Volvo sports car in part because the company was created to race Volvos in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/swedish-mopar-collection/">Sweden</a>. In fact, these are the guys who started Polestar before it was bought out by Volvo. To celebrate the heritage of the only mass-produced car brand left in Sweden, Cyan Racing settled on one of the sexiest-looking Volvos ever created.</p>
<p>To start off, this car has absolutely <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-crashed/">no driver’s aids</a>. For some that’ll be terrifying and for others that’s music to their ears. This means no ABS or brake booster, so you’re really getting that pure experience.</p>
<p>However, there is a long list of changes. For starters, the track is wider and the 18-inch forged wheels are larger that the originals. They’re also wrapped with Pirelli P Zero tires for the right kind of grip.</p>

<p>Of course, the engine has been upgraded to a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder based on the one used in the Volvo S60 TCI race car. It pushes an amazing 420-horsepower and redlines at 7700 rpm. Bolted up to it is a 5-speed custom Holinger transmission which Cyan Racing says mimics the car’s original mechanical feel.</p>
<p>Carbon-fiber and high-strength steel reinforcements have been added to the chassis to compensate for that huge power bump. This is still a rear-wheel-drive car, but the factory live axle has been swapped with an independent rear setup Cyan designed. A torque-biased rear limited-slip differential has also been installed. Both the front and rear suspension is fully adjustable.</p>
<p>This car sounds appropriately amazing, but production will be limited and pricing starts at $500,000. Now that they’re done a P1800 restomod, we think Cyan Racing should do a Volvo 240 next and call it the Flying Brick.</p>
