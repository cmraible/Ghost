<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11103">The Camaro</a> had an unbelievable amount of available options in its first generation. It’s four different packages could be ordered in at least seven colors with a multitude of stripe packages. It had at least 12 different engine options available to it and buyers had several transmissions to choose from. Some have said that with all of these options, GM could have made as <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11103">many different Camaros</a> as it wanted to in 1969 and have not two of them turn out to be the same. Of course this didn’t happen though and <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11103">many of the Camaros</a> that were shipped to dealer lots were somewhat identical. However, it is worth mentioning that it did seem like GM intended for these cars to be built exactly the way the buyers wanted them to be, which kind of makes a good case for restomodding a Camaro.</p>
