<hr>
<p>The concept of the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=15049">American performance car</a> was built on the idea of taking what other countries were doing in Europe and giving it a distinctly American accent, that's code for making it better. Of course, this attitude doesn't stop at the border because the car we are talking about took the passion for being the best and applied it to its fellow American competition. Once described as “a small animal that eats Mustangs”. If you haven't guessed by now, we're talking about the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2019-callaway-camaro-zl1/">Chevrolet Camaro</a>. More specifically, this is a 1967 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-camaro-pushes/">Camaro</a> RS/SS fully equipped with the RS package.</p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=15049">Under the hood</a> of this classic Chevy Camaro is a potent 396 cubic inch V8 engine, which is backed by a Muncie 4-speed manual transmission.

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=15049">The exterior of the car</a> is finished in the classic red we all know and love which is perfectly accented by the extremely recognizable black stripe in the front. One of the most important pieces of a car’s aesthetic is the wheels, luckily the classic chrome wheels still shine on and, to this day, give the car a distinctly classic look. Of course, the high praise of the Camaro is well deserved for what it is and people naturally flock towards these cars. This means that if you want to get your hands on this, you have to move quickly. This is the literal dream car of millions of Americans and it could be yours if you get their first.</p>
