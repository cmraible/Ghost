          "Following a detailed restoration in the 1990s, this Cord 812 survives today in its factory-correct shade of cream exterior paint called Cigarette Cream with an Oxblood Red leather interior that is absolutely elegant. Despite the restoration being as old as a classic itself, this vintage beauty still shows incredibly well and is a stunning example American automotive design. The highlight of the Cord 810 and 812 is definitely its timeless design consisting of the instantly recognizable coffin nose styling with a wraparound grille and the massive round fenders with hidden headlights, but everywhere you look on this car, there are intricate details that catch the eye."

Under that long, coffin-shaped hood is a 289 cubic-inch V8 paired to a four-speed transmission, and the engine compartment of this Cord is as show-worthy as every other aspect of this beautiful convertible. Top up or down, 1937 Cord 812 is absolutely artwork in motion!"
