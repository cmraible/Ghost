<hr>
<p>We're big fans of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/marketplace-oddity-1989-pontiac-firebird-proam/">third gen F-Bodies</a> here on Motorious. We found this one while browsing through entries in our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/digital-concours-spotlight-1971-detomaso-pantera/">Digital Concours</a>, and it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-2nd-gen-camaro/">had our attention</a> immediately.</p>
<p>We're old enough now to be nostalgic for the early '90s. Vanilla Ice on the radio, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on TV, and cool machines like <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries/2/American-Muscle/255">this Camaro Z28</a> roaming the streets. It was a great time, all things considered.</p>

<p>Back then, tough guys wore pink, and teal, purple, and neon was all the rage. We'll readily admit that we miss the ability to order a performance car in teal. Dark grey is just so boring by comparison.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, all of the aerodynamic aides, from the aggressive ground effects to the wild spoiler, are 100% factory. The only deviation from stock is the wheels, which are 17" reproductions of Trans Am GTA wheels. </p>

<p>They look great, and the gold basketweave style really fits in with the early '90s theme. Will gold BBS-style mesh wheels ever fall out of favor? Probably not.</p>
<p>1992 was the final year for the third gen F-Body. All of the Camaros built that year had small "25th Anniversary" plaques on the dash. Under the hood, you'll find a 5.7 liter, 350 cubic inch small block fed by Tuned Port Injection.</p>

<p>The Corvette would switch from the L98 TPI engine to the LT1 in 1992, while the Camaro would wait until the next year – and the next body style – to make the switch.</p>
<p>Many third gens were used and abused. While this car is mostly stock, we're just happy to see that it's been well cared for by a loving owner. That alone deserves recognition.</p>
