Even if cars are recovered after they’re taken, often they’re not in one piece. That’s why we always love highlighting those rare instances when someone’s classic vehicle is stolen and recovered, like this 1972 Chevy El Camino SS which was stolen in Jonesborough, Tennessee only to be recovered a few days later."

Jonesborough police apprehended one of the suspects quickly but were still looking for the second man and the classic car when they appealed to the public for help. They also offered a reward for information leading to the Chevy’s return."

He reportedly told police the only reward he really needed was seeing the Chevy returned to its rightful owner. We think this guy is a true hero and have no doubt many other enthusiasts would do the same thing."
