Sadly, this Mopar has a TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic instead of a manual transmission, so that’s a little disappointing. A 4.30 rear and a weight of 3,640 lbs. make for a competent setup, making this Dodge a definite threat on the drag strip."

Good thing the Chevy packs a rare L89 396ci V8 with OE aluminum heads for a factory-rated 375-hp. Like the Mopar, the Chevelle is running a 3-speed automatic, this one being the TH400. However, the 4.88 rear gear is nice and aggressive, which could give it the much-needed edge in the race, despite it tipping the scale at 3,690 lbs."
