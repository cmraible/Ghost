          " the interior, the exterior has been kept in pretty good shape, which allows us to examine the body and the individual design cues available at the time. The two moldings on each door were significant for both aerodynamics and style as they became one of the more subtle iconic features of the car, which clearly inspired the modern-day Charger. On top of that, you also get the bright orange paint job and classic decals, which signify the old television series The Dukes Of Hazzard. When all of these things are considered, we can see what made this a superb vehicle for the American youth in the late 1960s and early '70s."

          " also significant in this muscle car's attitude, rugged exterior, and interior styling. Under the hood, you'll find a meaningful piece that alludes to that sentiment quite well with its high displacement and horsepower output. 383 cubic inches of displacement flow through this massive V8 powerhouse, making upwards of around 335 horsepower for the driver's enjoyment. High-performance situations have always been something Dodge and Mopar, in general, have hoped to be synonymous with. That's why you should consider this beautiful 1970 Dodge Charger Dukes Of Hazzard tribute car for your next automotive purchase."
