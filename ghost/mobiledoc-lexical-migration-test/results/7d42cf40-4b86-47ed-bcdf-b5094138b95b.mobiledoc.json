From hiding high performance factory options in new car ordering forms, to taking on secret projects and trying to sneak them past corporate executives and into production. It was this kind of revolutionary rebel mentality that created legends and in late 1962 create a legendary name it did."

Using the project name “Lightweight”, Duntovs team built a total of 5 cars before the project was snuffed out and the cars were ordered to be destroyed. However, knowing that he had created something truly great, Duntov hid two of the cars and gave the other three to John Mecom of Houston Texas."
