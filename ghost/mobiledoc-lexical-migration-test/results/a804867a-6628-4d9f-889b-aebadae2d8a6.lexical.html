<p>“This is not okay with me. And this is to put in a big pitch for gun control. When it’s your family, you feel it.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1374127786999308293">Witness to the Boulder, Colo., supermarket shooting</a>, whose daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren were in line at the store for COVID-19 vaccinations when the attack began.</p>

<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/unprepared-covid-report/?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=154a61e4-1f2a-46b0-8439-c96f6806d861">new report</a> from Public Citizen, a national consumer watchdog group, the United States’ for-profit health care system was a leading cause of COVID-19 deaths. The study concludes that “millions of Americans have contracted COVID-19 unnecessarily and hundreds of thousands of deaths could have been prevented.” In total, the report found that one-third of COVID-19 deaths and around 40 percent of infections were linked to a lack of health insurance.</p>
<p>The report singles out employer-based health care, hospitals focusing on profits over safety, understaffing at nursing homes, and underfunding of public health infrastructure. It notes that existing disparities exacerbated the impact of the pandemic in Black communities in particular.</p>
<p>“The cardinal sin of our health care system is that it puts profits over people and corporations over communities,” the report reads.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the report recommends a Medicare-for-All system, pointing out that it “would be better able to disburse funds in emergency situations and to purchase necessary supplies, such as PPE or testing materials, and machinery, such as ventilators or respirators, during a crisis and get them where they need to go in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>The country <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-medicare-for-all/">moved one small step closer</a> to adopting a national health insurance program last week, when Democratic lawmakers reintroduced a Medicare for All bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra, a past advocate for such a system, to serve as Health and Human Services Secretary.</p>
<p>The Biden administration, however, is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/22/infrastructure-biden-drug-reform/">continuing</a> to focus health care discussions on subsidizing the premiums people pay for health insurance plans offered on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, further entrenching health insurers’ role in our system.</p>

<p>• <strong>HARVARD STUDENTS FIGHT SCHOOL’S FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENTS: </strong>A group of students at Harvard University have <a href="https://twitter.com/DivestHarvard/status/1371464539301056517">lodged a complaint</a> with the Massachusetts Attorney General claiming that their school’s fossil fuel investments are not only immoral, but illegal, thanks to a state law that regulates the governing of nonprofit charitable institutions. The complaint has the unanimous endorsement of the student government as well as 100 faculty members.</p>
<p><strong>• NEW WARNINGS ABOUT DANGERS OF REOPENING SCHOOLS:</strong> A <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/new-cdc-guidelines-to-reopen-schools-could-be-dangerous">new paper</a> published by the Institute for New Economic Thinking warns that the CDC’s guidelines for reopening schools may be insufficient to prevent COVID outbreaks similar to those seen in the U.K. The paper notes that children were between two and seven times more likely to be the first case in their household compared to adults. The report notes that the new B117 variant, which is dominant in Europe and resurgent in the U.S., is 50 percent more communicable and 30 percent more lethal.</p>
<p>• <strong>ZOOM TO THE BANK: </strong>The video chat company Zoom has seen record profits this year thanks to the pandemic, ending 2020 with $660 million in revenue before taxes. That’s a 4,000-percent increase from 2019, when it only made $16 million. In addition to those gains, the company had $4.2 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of Q4. Despite the windfall, Zoom found a way to <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001J0Gg7TZOasHOBLdS5rlZoT_YKttqa6Q0whFeyivK35yllWmDoBudzSRX8jPVgSBjUI4vIQxnXdB5ltDguA4WeR019Xw0V4z73SlJAm1b3WCqLKoKRB_L2WhmDzaahyNEI4p9ZQmsfesk5rsN6nm_MokG38Tl8QvlSW1Svb7IjJYQ6uBjSv0_dtj8uCfkiN638-ka4H-e-cXJU-BmsdgPAA==&c=-U9oRkcNPlNtNEyFCueL2f-FMs2yT3wqaZAhyNk_6xxHllNnWhJqZQ==&ch=8eZvFP8tKbaKTxMlvmGita8Sttaqaax97c9rydUIx2ACWnJtpbDj0Q==">pay nothing in federal taxes</a>.</p>
<p>• <strong>WEALTHY WHITE JURORS ARE FAILING BLACK DEFENDANTS: </strong>A new working <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28572?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg6">paper</a> published in the National Bureau of Economic Research notes that residents from predominantly white and high-income neighborhoods are over-represented on juries and are more likely to convict Black defendants and give them longer sentences. “We estimate that equal representation would reduce Black defendants’ median sentence length by 50 percent and the probability of receiving a life sentence by 67 percent,” it reads.</p>
<p><strong>• DR. FAUCI COURTS LOBBYISTS: </strong>Speaking to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, which represents drug manufacturers like Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he <a href="https://twitter.com/lhfang/status/1372938397057126401">opposes price controls</a> on the COVID-19 vaccine. He acknowledged “it's a profit-driven industry” and said “I've never seen a successful attempt at controls." Fauci said he would rather the government work with companies “in good faith” and laughed at the idea of establishing “a reasonable price” for the vaccine.</p>
