<p>There’s something extra cool about special edition cars. To a gearhead, having the special edition version of a car they already love can make you feel like royalty. Due to lower production numbers and limited year runs, you could go your whole life without parking to a car quite like yours if you’re manning an ‘edition’ car of any kind. Having one of these cars isn’t just a matter of car show social status, it’s also a smart investment as special edition cars rise in value as they become rarer and more desirable over the years. Here’s our picks of the coolest special editions cars on Motorious.</p>

<p>Not all special edition cars came that way from the factory, some, like this one, were created through a licensing deal. When the Camaro made a comeback after being cancelled in the fourth-generation, people were chomping at the bit to tinker with them. This 2010 'Fesler-Moss Edition', Chevrolet Camaro was built by Arizona based Chris Fesler who decided to design this car after seeing GM release the "new" Camaro. His design is special and incorporates the new coupled with his ideas on a retro looking body style which is second to none. He negotiated a Jon Moss Licensing deal as part of the total package. The car is powered by an LS9 motor that drops into the factory engine bay with 800-horsepower. See it here.</p>
