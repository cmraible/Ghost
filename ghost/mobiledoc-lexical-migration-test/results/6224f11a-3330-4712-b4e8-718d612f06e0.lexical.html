<p>In a <a title="Paid YouTube Channels" href="http://adage.com/article/digital/youtube-set-introduce-paid-subscriptions-spring/239437/" target="_blank">report by AdAge</a>, they are claiming that paid YouTube channels may starting appearing this spring.  YouTube is apparently planning to work with a small number of partners (to start) for the launch of paid subscriptions.  The paid channels will cost between $1 to $5 per month. The report also states that YouTube is considering charging access to live events and libraries of content.</p>
<p>AdAge also<em></em>says that YouTube’s paid channel subscriptions will start off as an experiment, with the initial group of channels being limited to about 25.  As for the revenue split between YouTube and partners, it is reported to be similar to the existing advertising arrangement.</p>
<p>What do you think?  Would you pay for YouTube content?</p>
