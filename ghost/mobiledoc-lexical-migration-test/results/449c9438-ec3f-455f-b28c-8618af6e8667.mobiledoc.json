The man cut up 9 refrigerators to fabricate what he calls “Grandpa Dwarf” which resembles a 1928 Chevy, although Adams is the first to admit it’s not as exact of a replica as some of this later attempts. That’s the thing with any unique skill like this, the more you do it the better you become at it, which is why you have to be determined to keep at it."

That’s right, they’re street legal and licensed. Some can hit 100 mph, so they’re not exactly toys. Plus, the interiors have everything found in the original cars, including radios and all the controls. Adams fabricates many of the parts from scratch, which is simply amazing."
