          "When you want to own a classic car that can win all kinds of awards at the best shows, you can’t settle with just anything. And while any 1963 Chevrolet Corvette with that eye-grabbing, rare split window is always going to generate excitement, few if any can hold a candle to this particular one. This is a genuine numbers-matching example which has achieved the coveted Triple Crown Registry Triple Crown Award as well as NCRS Top Flight honors. That alone should be enough to impress anyone, but there’s plenty more to this car."

Even more importantly, the ultra-critical judges will be impressed by the immaculate condition of the Daytona Blue exterior and Dark Blue interior, with correct details buttoned up to perfection. Even the 15-inch turbine-style wheels are free of blemishes and absolutely dazzle the eye."

You don’t come across many split-window C2 Corvettes, let alone one in such beautiful condition with a string of impressive awards under its belt. This would easily be the crown jewel of most collections."
