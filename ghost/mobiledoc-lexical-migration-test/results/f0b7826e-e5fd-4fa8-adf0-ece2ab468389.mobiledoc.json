In the latest installment, the crew goes to space where they encounter an all-powerful narcissist who fights against mansplaining and good storytelling. Okay, I made that last part up, but it could happen."

She said “excited doesn’t even begin to explain” her emotions “about joining the Fast family.” We’re sure she’s secretly a huge gearhead and will do for Fast and Furious what she did for Marvel and superhero movies in general."

          "Well, the answer is pretty simple: Chinese audiences. When the ninth movie came out it absolutely dominated the box office in the Middle Kingdom. The studio catered the film to appeal not only to the Chinese but more importantly to censors in the Chinese Communist Party. They must think Brie will get butts in seats in that ever-important market. "

          "I have a confession to make: I haven’t seen a Fast and Furious movie all the way through since Tokyo Drift. The first three are pretty awful films, okay really awful films, and after waiting all that time for them to magically become good I just gave up. With this latest development I’m glad I jumped off that crazy train when I did. The pretenses of the sequels keep getting more ridiculous and some of the casting choices are just awful. But this latest move is the cringiest of them all."
