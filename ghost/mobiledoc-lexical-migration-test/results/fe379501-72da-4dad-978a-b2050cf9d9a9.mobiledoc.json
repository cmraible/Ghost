It's also believed that, this car is one of only 13, thanks to its factory Sebring Silver Metallic paint job. Adding to the rare color is black sports stripes and a functional hood scoop. Not to mention, this Camaro sports the famous Berger panel, which became a highly sought after addition to non-Berger Camaros in the years following."

Backing the beefed up engine is a six-speed manual transmission, and it rolls on an upgraded suspension, with braking power from upgraded brakes."
