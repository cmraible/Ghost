It has looks to kill, and a modern powertrain to back it up! Amongst the highlights are the 5.3-liter engine that is backed by a ultra-fun T56 6-speed transmission, and accompanying upgrades to compliment the beast's new heart."

Sporting the original paint, this 4-wheel drive truck has new vented disc brakes up front, new interior, powder coated wheels, and new Ranchero 5000 shocks."

This example is a great representative when the car/truck was pretty awesome. It has been freshly restored, and has a few updates, here and there, but remains pretty true to original form."
