<p>The exterior of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Buick/Skylark" rel="nofollow">Buick Skylark</a> looks pretty clean. A nice two-tone black and green exterior with a thin red stripe dividing the two dominant colors adds a very customized look. Chromed bumpers, fender vents, rocker strip, and more add a touch of class without getting carried away. The factory badges are still in place, including the tri-shield on the grille and the Buick name at the very front of the hood. Nice tinted wheels almost match the upper portion of the body, while the mag wheels are a great classic touch.</p>
<p>Under the hood sits a brutal 350ci V8, so this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">car</a> has some solid power to back up the aggressive exterior. With an automatic transmission you don’t have to worry about accidentally grinding gears or having to double clutch, making driving this Buick Skylark much easier. Power steering and power brakes are a huge help as well.</p>
<p>Mostly stock, the black interior for this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Buick" rel="nofollow">Buick</a> is clean and overall in good condition. The vinyl upholstery isn’t showing damage or even much wear, while the door panels and carpeting look pretty fresh as well. Factory air conditioning is something you’ll be grateful to have next summer, especially if you’re looking to drive longer distances in this classic. The previous owner smartly kept the factory radio in place, adding a modern deck below the dash. All the original gauges and controls are also still there.</p>
<p>With the muscle cars raging, Buick stepped up its game for the Skylark in 1968, debuting a reworked A-body with a more muscular vibe. This coupe has the upgraded engine, making it more entertaining to drive. It could make a great vehicle for someone looking to get into collecting cars or just a nice addition to a growing collection.
