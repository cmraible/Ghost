<p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/purdue-pharma-appeals-judge-reverses-opioid-settlement"><strong>Federal Court Blocks Purdue Settlement Agreement</strong></a> (Bloomberg) — <em>There is a new development in a story The Daily Poster has been </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/opioid-billionaire-demand-sweeping-immunity/"><em>covering</em></a><em> for months. Bloomberg reports that “U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon on Thursday struck down the OxyContin maker’s sweeping opioid settlement, putting the accord at risk of collapsing. Supporters of the deal have warned that the alternative to a settlement is years of costly </em>—<em> and potentially fruitless </em>—<em> litigation. Purdue Pharma said in a statement that it will appeal. In the meantime, it’s a victory for a handful of state attorneys general and an arm of the U.S. Justice Department, which have been working to overturn the settlement.” Now, lawmakers have </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1471858665955069952"><em>another chance</em></a><em> to </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/punishing-the-pain-profiteers/"><em>pass existing legislation</em></a><em> to ban the type of third party releases the Sacklers want to use to protect their fortune and evade accountability.</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_8d685482-5a0e-11ec-9a37-efa45f6d2c92.html"><strong>Criminal Justice Reformer Elected Sheriff in New Orleans</strong></a> (Nola) — <em>“Hutson is the first Black woman elected as a sheriff in Louisiana history. Along with Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams, self-styled reformers of the criminal justice system now control New Orleans' two top elected law enforcement posts, a remarkable reversal in a city that was once one of the most incarcerated places on the planet. Hutson has pledged to double down on efforts to reduce the jail's population, to stop an 89-bed jail expansion, to end charges for phone calls from jail and to bring the lockup into compliance with a federal reform agreement.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/12/14/politics-prose-bookstore-employees-unionize/"><strong>Employees of Politics and Prose Bookstore File to Unionize</strong></a><strong></strong>(DCist) — <em>“Workers at Politics and Prose, the longtime independent bookstore with three locations around D.C., have decided to unionize, joining a growing labor movement of retail workers across the country. If successful, Politics and Prose would become what appears to be the only bookstore in the District with a unionized workforce. Of more than 100 total employees at the brand’s three locations, organizers believe that 55 will be eligible for the union. Last week, owners said they wouldn’t recognize the union until a majority of staff voted in a formal election, which some believe buys management time to disparage unionizing.” In response to management’s refusal to recognize the union and its efforts to stop it, New York Times correspondent Peter Goodman </em><a href="https://twitter.com/petersgoodman"><em>spoke out</em></a><em> in solidarity with the workers before speaking at the bookstore.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/search-congress-personal-finances-with-insiders-exclusive-database-2021-12"><em><strong>Insider </strong></em><strong>Launches New Database to Explore Lawmakers’ Financials</strong></a><strong></strong>(Insider) — <em>“</em>Insider<em> has compiled and analyzed hundreds of US House and Senate financial disclosures to create a searchable, sortable, and near-complete accounting of members of Congress' personal finances. The databases — </em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fkUGbA1vaqTajmOcENuhc8WaqatScp8fttCWG83-NCc/edit?usp=sharing"><em>one for the Senate</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MT0sqKlJdD3oTRIpxl2l5WZZpDkj8OGWBZPivfQR6JU/edit?usp=sharing"><em>one for the House</em></a><em> — include members of Congress' individual assets, stock transactions, debts, and other outside income. They are the most complete and detailed public accounting of the individual finances of federal lawmakers. Insider's "</em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/conflicted-congress-key-findings-stock-act-finances-investing-2021-12"><em>Conflicted Congress</em></a><em>" investigation used this data to reveal how members of the US House and Senate often disregard their own ethical regulations, which are designed to combat corruption and curb conflicts of interest.’”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-book.html?referringSource=articleShare"><strong>Andrew Cuomo Ordered to Forfeit Earnings From $5.1 Million Book Deal</strong></a><strong></strong>(New York Times) — <em>“It was not long ago that Mr. Cuomo was at his peak, winning nationwide acclaim and landing a lucrative book contract in the first months of New York’s pandemic crisis. The resulting memoir, </em>American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic<em>, was intended to capitalize on the moment and give him a financial cushion that would safeguard his future. But by a 12-1 vote on Tuesday, the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics stripped him of all of the book’s proceeds. The board had previously ruled that Mr. Cuomo had received authorization for the deal under false pretenses, and it decided on Tuesday that he was not entitled to keep any of the profits from it.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/15/1064598531/the-fda-could-permanently-lift-some-restrictions-on-abortion-pills"><strong>FDA Okays Abortion Pills By Mail</strong></a><strong></strong>(NPR) — <em>“The drug, mifepristone, is approved for use in combination with another medication, misoprostol, to terminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks and is sometimes used to treat women experiencing miscarriages. Before the coronavirus pandemic, doctors could prescribe the pills only to patients who were able to pick them up in person. But in response to COVID-19, the Biden administration suspended that requirement, allowing them to be mailed to patients instead. The decision by the FDA on Thursday makes that change permanent.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/sru-uaw-university-"><strong>How the Largest Union Fight of 2021 Was Won</strong></a> (The Nation) — <em>“Last week, after decades of organizing, 17,000 student researchers across the University of California (UC) won recognition of our union, Student Researchers United–United Auto Workers (SRU-UAW). Spanning 10 campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, we’re now the largest academic student employee union in US history, following one of the biggest new organizing drives in any sector in this century. But it wasn’t easy. For months after we petitioned for union recognition with supermajority support, UC administration refused to respect our democratic choice to unionize, despite overwhelming public and legislative pressure. Finally, 10,890 of our coworkers voted by 97.5 percent to strike unless UC dropped its trumped-up legal objections to our union—and we won.”</em></p>

Another Buffalo cafe is waiting to hear the results of its union election due to challenged ballots, while a third voted against unionizing. Three more Buffalo-area locations have filed for elections, as well as a cafe in Mesa, Arizona. Johnson said on CNBC's "Mad Money with Jim Cramer" on Nov. 7 that he expected a handful of additional stores to organize..’”</em></p>
