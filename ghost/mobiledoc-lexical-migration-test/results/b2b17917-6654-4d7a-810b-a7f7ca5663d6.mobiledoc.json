Alesi piloted this car to multiple podium finishes that season including a first place finish at the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix, which was also the time a V12-powered Formula 1 car won a Grand Prix. Following the 1995 season, Ferrari switched to the V10-powered F310 racecar making the 412 T2 obsolete."

Under Zwart's ownership, 412 T2 chassis no. 157 was raced at several events and even driven at the Monaco Historic Grand Prix in 2013. It was purchased by its current owner in 2013, who had the racecar inspected and certified by Ferrari Classiche. Chassis 157 was restored in 2018 in Maranello, Italy, and it's being sold in track-ready condition."
