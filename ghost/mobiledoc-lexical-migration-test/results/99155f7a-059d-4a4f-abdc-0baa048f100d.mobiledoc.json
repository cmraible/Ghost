That’s not what anyone who’s wanting to buy an affordable car wants to hear. The Bloomberg report then goes on to highlight some New York City dealerships with incredibly low supply, including one with a 6-day inventory where the salesmen are all sabotaging each other because they’re so desperate to make sales. But not every dealership is that way, so you’re getting a purposely skewed perspective with the silent implication that’s how it is all over the country."

But these market conditions will probably continue until 2023.” That’s nice he leaves himself an out with two “probably” statements, both of which could easily not age well. At least I hope they don’t age well for the sake of American households which are feeling the financial squeeze."

The opening two sentences are meant to drive that hot take right through your heart: “Not too long ago, you could pick up a worn but decent used car for something like $5,000 and hit the road. Those days may be long gone.” You hear that? The days of buying an affordable car are over, peasants! As they say in journalism, if it bleeds it leads.

But we would be paying high prices for just about everything else, so it wouldn’t be solely about the used car market anymore but instead the entire US economy. Like we’ve reported before, the price inflation supposedly was caused by a convergence of some unique conditions, most of them imposed by the pandemic and strict government restrictions slapped on a good portion of the country. As those conditions change and go back to normal, why would used car prices persist on their completely insane trajectory if those prices were fueled by factors which have reversed? It makes zero sense. Saying that doesn’t get the clicks, yet here I am."
