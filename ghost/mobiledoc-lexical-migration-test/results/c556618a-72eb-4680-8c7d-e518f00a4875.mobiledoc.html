<hr>
<p>Few things are worse than seeing an exotic Italian supercar wrecked out on the side of the road. That’s exactly the horrific scene laid out in a YouTube video and many other social media posts recently. Since misery loves company we want the rest of you to join us in mourning the death of this Pagani Zonda C12 S, or maybe you’ll mock the guy sitting on the ground next to it, probably rethinking his life choices.</p>

<p>Okay, the car isn’t dead, but the driver crashed into a tree in a ditch at the side of a road. According to social media posts, this happened on a twisty road outside of Prague, Czech Republic. We can put two and two together: this guy probably thought he’s the next Ayrton Senna and so he pushed what’s notoriously a wild, raw hypercar hard, which ended poorly.</p>
<p>After crashing, the guy probably wondered what happened to his lightning reflexes he honed playing many hours of Forza, then blamed it on the very expensive hypercar he wrecked, because nothing is his fault. That’s a guess, but we’ve seen this scene play out many times in the recent past, so it’s not a bad one.</p>

<p>Considering how incredibly rare Pagani Zondas are, it’s not like this guy can go to AutoZone, have them sell him the wrong part, return twice because of the same problem, then fix it all up in the third bay of his suburban garage. The parts will have to be ordered from Italy, he’ll get a fiery scolding in Italian, then he’ll have to shell out a bunch of euros for them, then pay even more for a mechanic crazy enough to touch the Pagani to get it repaired.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to imagine how anyone could lose control of a Pagani Zonda C12 S. With a potent AMG-sourced 7.0-liter V12 making 542-horsepower (hey, it was a lot back in 2000) and 553 lb.-ft. of torque, this thing with a 6-speed manual can do 0-62 in 3.7 seconds. It also doesn’t come with all the electronic driver aids everyone seems to think are necessary these days.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SafJUI4xzMk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
