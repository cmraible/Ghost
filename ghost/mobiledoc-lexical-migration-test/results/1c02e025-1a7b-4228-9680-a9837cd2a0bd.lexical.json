With the rising popularity of restomods and people wanting to push the envelope between old and new as far as possible, there has been a few “body swap” over the years. We’ve seen everything from the shell of a classic Mustang sitting on an S550 chassis to classic truck bodies being bolted up to a newer model’s underpinnings, though these types of projects are probably thought of a lot more than they are actually attempted.",
