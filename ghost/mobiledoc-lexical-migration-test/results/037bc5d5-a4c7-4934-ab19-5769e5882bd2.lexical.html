<p>What a diverse market the collector car industry represents. Every week, the Motorious editorial staff does a dive into the classified section of the site to find the cars for sale that we would want to buy for ourselves. These cars are more than worthy of a new garage, and we're thrilled to be able to share our picks with the readers each week. Here is a list of cars to check out as we roll into the first during the middle of June.</p>

<p>The first-gen Camaro is an icon among classic car collectors in just about all forms, but cars equipped with the RS and SS packages always seem to be a litter more coveted. For a perfect example of this, just check out the 1968 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS Convertible that is currently up for sale through Corvette Mike Midwest.</p>

<p>Even in stock form, a Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is a serious muscle car, with some arguing it’s more of a supercar. That second point might be debatable, but there’s no arguing that this particular ZL1 modified by Vengeance Racing is something to be respected. With more than 860-horsepower on tap, it should be obvious this Chevy should really only be driven by those with plenty of experience using high-powered, rear-wheel-drive cars.</p>

<p>When it comes to the best designed automobiles, pre-war cars are always at the top of the conversation, and the Cord 810/812 lineup is an excellent example. Although this car was only offered for two model years (as the 1936 810 and 1937 812), it was at the cutting edge of vehicle design, and this gorgeous 1937 Cord 812 would make the perfect addition to an elegant collection as it is currently up for grabs through the Classic Car Club of America's Full Classics Online Auction.</p>

<p>The Chevrolet brand and Pace Car program are a natural fit - especially when talking about Corvettes. Chevy’s sports car has filled the Pace Car position more times than any other make/model in the program’s history, will no fewer than 15 notices under its belt. This particular example, a 1998 Corvette Indy Pace Car convertible is a pristine celebration of the program, and one of the Special Edition production models Chevy released to the public.</p>

This truck will be up for grabs during the upcoming GAA Classic Cars auction in July, and it will certainly be one of the most high-profile lots.</p>
