<p>Cloaked in a beautiful Fire Red, this classic Buick is in excellent shape. A vinyl black top protects the roof and adds welcoming contrast to its glossy red paint job. Factory Rallye wheels sit on all four corners and add to its muscle car curb appeal. Inside its tan interior is a replica vintage-style radio that bumps tunes through an amplifier.</p>
<p>Tucked inside the highly detailed engine compartment is a large and built 455cui V8 that generates an impressive 560-horsepower and 581 lb/ft of torque. An automatic transmission shifts all the power down to a 3.73 posi rear end. According to the description, no expense was spared when building the engine and transmission, and everything on this car has been fully documented.</p>
