<p>Conference time again. This time it’s <a href="http://somesso.com/london10/">Somesso</a> – The Social Business Summit 2010.</p>
<div></div>
<div>It’s a small affair, and one with far more people in suits that, say, Like Minds from a couple of weeks ago. </div>[![IMG_3142 - Version 2.jpg](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/assets_c/2010/03/IMG_3142 - Version 2-thumb-250x374-1609.jpg)](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2010/03/IMG_3142-Version-2.jpg)<div></div>What does business look like when everything is networked?<p>Jeff Dachis of the <a href="http://www.dachisgroup.com" title="Dachis Group">Dachis group</a> kicked off with some interesting observation that he and he team came up with15 years ago when he founded <a href="http://www.razorfish.com" title="Razorfish">Razorfish</a> in New York.: everything that could be digital would be, because it makes things better, faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>And things have shifted that way, but there have been road bumps along the way. One major example was marketers co-opting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" title="Dot-com bubble">dotcom boom</a>, and creating a  whole lot of business that shouldn’t have existed at the time.</p>
<p>Marketers took one way messages and tried to push them into an environment that was designed for more interactive and social communications – and he’s suggesting that the same is happening to social media..</p>
<p>Indeed, marketers took something of a bashing in Jeff’s talk. “Social media marketing is largely ineffective and incremental at best,” he suggested. And it’s still not very significant – only 0.5% of digital marketing spend is social media.</p>
<p>And thus, this is not a discussion about marketing, but social business – about using social tools to connect everybody in the chain that business involves. And, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law" title="Reed's law">Reed’s Law</a>, as the number of people in that network grows, so does the value of that network.</p>
<p>And the purpose of today is to try and address some of those issues:</p>
<p>How do we take an industrial/assembly line model and move it to a sharing network?</p>
<p>What is it about our culture that we don’t want to connect and share and communicate and how can we change that?</p>
<p>Busy day ahead…</p>
