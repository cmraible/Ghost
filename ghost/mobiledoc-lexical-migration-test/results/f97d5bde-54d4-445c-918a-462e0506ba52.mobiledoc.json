A unique front fascia and rear spoiler are designed to add stability during hard acceleration and high-speed maneuvers, plus there’s a snorkel for cold air induction, and Brembo brakes further keep the driver in control. Plus, both Launch Control and Launch Assist are included so you don’t embarrass yourself at the track, at least hopefully."

Dodge announced back on January 21 that all the orders are full, so the SUV is sold out. However, there at least were a few dealer-allocated units, but those might be gone by now. But you never know, so if you’re determined you might be able to track one down before it’s too late. Since these are supposed to be more limited than the Dodge Demon, it could be tricky to get one and aftermarket prices will likely be sky high."
