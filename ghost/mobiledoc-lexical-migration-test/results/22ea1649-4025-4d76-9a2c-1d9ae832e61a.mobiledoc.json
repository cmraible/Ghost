While the decision to kill a well-received concept before it reaches production is one that auto manufacturers often make in a seemingly indiscriminate way, the decision is one that usually pushes the concept to the side to make room for the next unbelievably cool project that will be irresistible to commentators and consumers alike. However, that is not exactly how it all went down for the 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra."

Chris Theodore, an engineer that worked on many of the same projects as Shelby, currently owns the car and can be seen giving YouTuber DtRockstar1 a ride around the M1 Concourse race track outside of Detroit, Michigan in this video. Even though he is clearly not pushing the car anywhere near its limits, it is still fascinating to see the torquey beast jolting up to speed with a remarkable and unfamiliar exhaust note."
