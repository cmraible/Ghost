The listing says that while the car runs, the engine keeps throwing belts, which means that a trailer will be required to get this land yacht home. Also, there was no indication as to why the car has a salvage title, but there doesn't appear to be any noticeable damage showing in the pictures. Even if you don't want to fix it up to get it running, this Bentley looks clean enough inside and out that it would also make for a perfect display car to draw attention to a business or luxury garage."

Under the hood, these big cars packaged an equally large 6.75-liter V8 rated at 220 horsepower, and this car's engine is believed to have 82,000 original miles."
