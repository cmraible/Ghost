For his 50th birthday, Shaquille O’Neal got a Dodge Charger Hellcat with a Diesel Dog Mafia logo and them on it, which is an ode to his slingshot crew. He’s proving that 50 is no time to hang up the keys to your muscle car."

Stock, it would be around 707-horsepower, more if its a Redeye, 797-horsepower, which is likely the case. It could also have some modifications under the hood, we’re hoping to learn more about the Charger Hellcat, or maybe even see it rolling around since it’s in my neck of the woods, and spotting this car would be pretty easy, not to mention who would be driving it."
