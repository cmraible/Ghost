Kickstarting the trend with Petty's third championship victory in 1971, this Plymouth Road Runner (Lot K85) claimed the first-ever Winston Cup Series crown ever posted. Not only that, this car propelled him over $1 million in prize money won during his racing career. Richard Petty would go on to nab 21 race wins with 19 in this car alone, as well as finishing in the top five a total of 38 times during NASCAR's last \"long season\". This historic 1971 Plymouth Road Runner will be crossing the Mecum auction in Indy on Saturday, July 11th, 2020.",
