This Corvette does have the optional Z51 package that adds an extra $5,000 for equipment such as Brembo brakes, electronic limited slip differential, performance suspension, a performance rear axle and Michelin Pilot Sport 4S summer tires. The Corvette's mid-mounted 6.2-liter V8 is rated at up to 495 horsepower (when equipped with the performance exhaust) at 6,450 rpm, and the Shelby's 5.2-liter supercharged V8 delivers 760 horsepower at 7,300 rpm."

In a 40 mph rolling start drag race, the Shelby's higher power and redline allows the Mustang to blow the doors off the Corvette."
