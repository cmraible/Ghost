<p>Three men were placed in custody by Hyderabad police after the Delhi-based gang <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/40-stolen-cars-canada/">stole</a> a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2002-ferrari-575/">Ferrari</a> worth $268,000 (RS 2 crore or 20,000 Indian Rupree) from a Secunderabad businessman. According to The News Minute, the trio rolled up to the home belonging to Divesh Gandhi while he was away.

<p>Once the men made off with the high-end <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/black-horse-garage/">exotic</a>, the family then realized they were deceived into giving away the keys and visited the Karkhana police station to make a report. Within 48 hours, cops were able to locate the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/clapton-ferraris/">Ferrari</a> in Tolichowki by utilizing CCTV footage, and then they moved in to arrest agent Neeraj Sharma from Hyderabad, along with the other two Delhi men from Bhupender and Saddam.</p>
<p>Divesh bought the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ferrari-banned-celebrities/">Ferrari</a> last year in 2019 from a woman in Kerala, but it still was registered in Delhi. Hyderabad-based agent Nilesh Sharma tried to work with Divesh to get the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-fieri-lambo/">exotic car</a> reregistered in his name, and Sharma then sought additional help from another agent based in Delhi, Prince Pathak. </p>
<p>The required registration forms were submitted by Divesh to Nilesh to get the ball rolling. Karkhana Inspector P Madhukar Swamy informed the The New Indian Express that once Prince Pathak received Divesh's paperwork, that he didn't register the vehicle in the appropriate name but instead entered the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1982-ferrari-magnum-pi/">Ferrari</a> in the system under the name Bilal. According to the report, Bilal is the name of the person who sent the three men to snatch the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1962-ferrari-250-gte/">Ferrari</a> from Divesh's residence.</p>
<p>According to the police, the three men belonged to a vehicle theft gang out of Delhi and currently sit under judicial remand where they have been charged with conspiracy, misrepresentation, and cheating.</p>
