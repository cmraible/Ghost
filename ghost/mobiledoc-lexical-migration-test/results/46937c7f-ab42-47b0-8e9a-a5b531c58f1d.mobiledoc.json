On the other side of the aisle, the Japanese sports car has a 6.7-liter LS-based V8 engine and a three-speed automatic transmission.

This is very well shown as the two pull off the start line and the 3600 lb Camaro initially pulls forward because of better traction but then slowly begins to lag as the 240 SX wizzes by. In total, the Nissan only weighs 2,800lbs which is sort of a massive difference and is probably the main reason why it won both the first and second race. However, in the end the Nissan was only able to beat the Camaro by using an engine platform designed for the Camaro so we all know who the real winner is here… yeah, it's still the Nissan."
