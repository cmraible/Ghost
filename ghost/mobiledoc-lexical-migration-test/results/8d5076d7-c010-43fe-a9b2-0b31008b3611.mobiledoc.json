And, as you probably know, it can be rather challenging to remove software that has been installed by the manufacturer as the typical uninstall methods will not work. Luckily, there is a way to remove the preloaded software, it just takes a little bit of work. This tutorial assumes that you have <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/115297/how-to-root-your-android-why-you-might-want-to/\" target=\"_blank\">root privileges</a> on your Android Device and that you know how to connect to the device using the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html\" target=\"_blank\">Android Debug Bridge</a>.</p>\n<p>Be very careful with these instructions. Every Android device is different and when you start messing around with low-level system files, you always run the risk of accidentally bricking your device. Also make sure you are not violating and Terms of Use with your device manufacturer or carrier.</p>\n<p><!--more-->1. Connect to your Android device and launch the ADB shell<br />\n<code>adb shell</code></p>\n<p>2. You may need to gain root privileges<br />\n<code>su</code></p>\n<p>3. Navigate to your system app directory<br />\n<code>cd /system/app</code><br />\nIf that doesn&#8217;t work, you may need to mount the system directory first<br />\n<code>mount -o remount,rw -t rfs /dev/stl5 /system</code></p>\n<p>4. Delete the .apk from the system app director<br />\n<code>rm -r [ApplcationName].apk</code></p>\n<p>5. Navigate to your Application data directory<br />\n<code>cd /data/data</code></p>\n<p>6. Delete the Application data directory<br />\n<code>rm -r [ApplicationPackage]</code></p>\n<p>7. Return to your local shell and pull the application list from the device<br />\n<code>adb pull /data/system/packages.xml</code></p>\n<p>8. Open the local packages.xml in a text editor and locate the <strong>&lt;package&gt;</strong> tag for the application</p>\n<p>9. Delete everything between the <strong>&lt;package&gt; &lt;/package&gt;</strong> tags (inclusive) for the application</p>\n<p>10. Push the modified application list back onto the device<br />\n<code>adb push packages.xml /data/system</code></p>\n<p>11. Reboot the device</p>\n<p>After that, the application should be gone from your device.</p>\n"
