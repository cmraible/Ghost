Although it had throwback looks, the new motorcycle used modern technology to push the envelope. An air-cooled, fuel-injected, desmodromic valve 992cc L-twin produces 92-horsepower, a nice bump over the classic predecessor. It also comes with a wet clutch starting with the 2007 model year, plus that was paired with a 6-speed transmission versus the 750’s 5-speed. As aptly shown off in the movie, the Sport 1000 handles incredibly well, tanks to the 3-way adjustable Sachs shocks in the rear, plus upside-down Marzocchi front forks, combined with Ducati’s trellis frame. In other words, it’s a legitimately good bike.",
