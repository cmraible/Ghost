That’s why we were shocked to hear a security firm based in the UK claims it exploited a security flaw in the Tesla Model S and Model Y, allowing it to unlock and start the electric vehicles without the key fob nearby.",

Still, this certainly is a concerning revelation. Khan did state it can be performed on many other cars as well as smart house locks, smartphones, and laptops among other products. Without being specific, he claimed to have performed the same hacking attack on several other automaker’s cars as well as numerous devices.",
