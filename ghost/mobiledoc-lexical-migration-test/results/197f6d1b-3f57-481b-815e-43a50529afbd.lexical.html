<p>Maybe it’s the damage they usually incur during the race or maybe it has to do with some kind of cover up for top automaker officials breaking the <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/554403/1960-chevrolet-corvette-le-mans-racer/">rules of the 1960s </a>and secretly sponsoring certain <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-builds-1930s-style-race-car/">race</a> teams. Either way, all of the greats have their stories of lost cars. For Ford it's Shelby’s “Little Red” Mustang and for Chevrolet it’s this little known Cole, Duntov, and Cunningham Corvette project aimed at conquering the 24-Hours Of Le Mans.</p>
