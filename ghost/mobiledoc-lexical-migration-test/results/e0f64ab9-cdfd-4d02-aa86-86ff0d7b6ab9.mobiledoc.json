Our old gadgets become casualties of our lust for the latest and greatest, though instead of selling them off or throwing them away, some keep these older devices around as a reminder of what used to be.</p>\n<p>I solicited submissions from a couple of people who work in the areas of technology and communications. Each has a device that has been made obsolete by the current generation of game consoles, or by the newest, fastest laptops and tablets &#8212; yet they&#8217;ve chosen to hold on to it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sony-laser-disc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-29316\" alt=\"sony-laser-disc\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sony-laser-disc-300x137.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"137\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/sony-laser-disc-300x137.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/sony-laser-disc.jpg 603w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>Rick Clancy</em></p>\n<p><strong>Company:</strong> <em>COVARIO</em></p>\n<p><strong>Device:</strong> <em>Sony Laser Disc player</em></p>\n<p>It seems Rick enjoys holding onto old relics. He also has a MiniDisc player/recorder, an 8mm camcorder and an 8mm home deck. The Laser Disc format was introduced to the market in 1978 and, despite the rise of VHS and DVD, held on for a long time. The last Laser Disc release in the U.S. came in 2000, and the last player was manufactured in 2009.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/atari-system.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-29317\" alt=\"atari-system\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/atari-system-300x178.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/atari-system-300x178.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/atari-system-1024x608.jpg 1024w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/atari-system.jpg 1938w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>Jason Sutherland</em></p>\n<p><strong>Company:</strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.baynetwork.com/\">Baynetwork</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Device:</strong> <em>Atari 2600</em></p>\n<p>Jason told me that the Atari 2600 was the first game system he ever had in his home. Fun fact: he also had a Pong-integrated TV. The 2600 was released in 1977 and launched at a price of $199. If it was selling today, the price adjusted for inflation would be $769.09.

Keene now runs his own development company and works on much newer machines, but he still keeps the ELF II in his basement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pxl2000.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-29321\" alt=\"pxl2000\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pxl2000-283x300.jpg\" width=\"283\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/pxl2000-283x300.jpg 283w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/pxl2000.jpg 567w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>Joshua Barber</em></p>\n<p><strong>Company</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.v4development.com/\"><em>V4 Development, LLC</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>Device: </strong><em>Fisher-Price PXL2000</em></p>\n<p>The PXL2000 came out back in 1987 and gave kids the ability to shoot video onto audio cassette tapes in black and white.
