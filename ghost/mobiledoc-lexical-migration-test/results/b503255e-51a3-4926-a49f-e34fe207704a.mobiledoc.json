Since an estimated 450 to 650 were ever made, bagging one is understandably difficult and expensive. Fortunately, this 1970 Ford Bronco being sold through GR Auto Gallery offers the iconic looks and performance of the Baja Bronco at a far more affordable price."

Original instruments and a factory steering wheel keep everything looking authentic. A modern CD player allows you the convenience of listening to your tunes while trekking anywhere. Also included for the interior is a nice roll bar, which is a nice reassurance."

There’s a 302ci V8 paired to a manual transmission, providing all the horsepower and torque necessary to keep moving through all kinds of terrain. Power steering and power brakes help you to make the most of that performance. Massive 33x12.5-inch Dick Cepek tires provide the right kind of grip for trail runs. A spare is mounted to the rear, just like on the original Baja Bronco."
