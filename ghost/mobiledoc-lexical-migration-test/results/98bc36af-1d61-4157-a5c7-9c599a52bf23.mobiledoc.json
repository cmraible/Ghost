This game really speaks to people who play in support roles in these kinds of games and are always being overshadowed by the rest of the party, while also being under appreciated by said team. As for anyone who normally doesn’t play healer, the difficulty of this game really speaks volumes of how hard playing a healer in a party game can be."

During battle, you have to manage your spells, mana, and your party's health, however you have ways to restore mana and your party has certain conditions that’ll allow them to deal higher damage. An example of this is Tanky the party Tank who deals higher damage when he is above 90% health or Murky the Wizard who enters an aura-like state while you’re meditating to restore mana. You can’t just continuously cast spells though because the more frequently you cast, the faster your wand will burn out, preventing you from casting any spells at all."
