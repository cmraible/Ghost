The driver’s set centered and two passenger seats flanking it is also a pretty unique feature. McLaren only made 106 of these between 1992 and 1998, making them highly sought-after today. This one, Chassis 029, is just 1 of 64 road-going cars in the production run. It’s all-original and has just 243 miles on the odometer, which definitely contributed to its record selling price."
