This is yet another example of why you shouldn’t give into temptation and engage in a street race on public roads, even if another driver tries goading you into it."

Not only that, you have to contend with traffic that’s going the speed limit or at least close to it. In this case, the person driving the Mustang somehow failed to see a car in the same lane which was going far slower, slamming it and causing a fireball to erupt."

When you race on the street, innocent bystanders who are just trying to get to work, home, or wherever they’re going on a normal day are put right in the crossfire without even knowing it."

They didn’t make a choice to street race, but still paid a price for the decision these two drivers made. That’s hardly just or fair."
