You play as Asha who has all of the basic abilities that you would expect in a platformer; she can jump, attack with her sword and also defend with her shield. Things become a bit more interesting when her sidekick, Pepelogoo, is introduced after approximately 30 minutes of gameplay. Pepelogoo looks a bit like a small Kirby i.e. a blob with eyes and small arms/wings and is a recognisable icon of the franchise. Asha is only able to do a single jump unless you summon Pepelogoo to help, at which point, you are then able to double jump and glide. Pepelogoo can also be thrown about in various directions (poor Pepelogoo) to activate switches; Asha also holds her little companion above her head like a helmet to protect her from falling lava. I would say no Pepelogoos were harmed in the making of this video game but that is clearly not the case.",

There are a total of 200 life drops in the game; some can be found in the hub world (more on this later) and some can be found within the individual dungeons/temples. You can also collect coins which can be used to buy stronger swords, shields and elixirs.

Yes, you could say that was my fault, but I haven’t played a game with no auto-save feature for years! I think I understand why the developers did this (and I’m cutting them some slack here); in any given dungeon/temple, you progress through it like a traditional level and by that, I mean you fall down holes and pits which you are then unable to scale again.

At the end of each temple, you defeat a boss (as well as a mini-boss on the way) before returning to Rapadagna. Each temple is pretty long, which is another slightly disappointing element for me. I would have very much preferred if there were eight smaller temples rather than four bigger ones because each temple is quite repetitive within itself. For example the first temple, which is earth themed, is full of dark muddy-looking rooms and tunnels and once you’ve seen one muddy tunnel, you’ve seen them all. More variety but smaller locations would have gone a long way to breaking up the gameplay. I appreciate this is a remake of a game from 1994 and four temples was probably perfectly acceptable back then, but it feels dated now.",
