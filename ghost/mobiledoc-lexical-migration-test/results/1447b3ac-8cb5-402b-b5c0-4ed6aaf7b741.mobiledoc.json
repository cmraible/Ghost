That’s like leaving behind a trunk full of gold or suitcases loaded with 100-dollar bills. We’re guessing whoever did this somehow didn’t realize the value of this classic American muscle car."

We know that would be the first suspicion upon finding such a vehicle just abandoned. What’s more, it’s a numbers-matching, earlier example with the trunk-mount battery. Definitely the previous owner had no idea what they were leaving behind."

While it’s not much to look at for the average person, someone with a trained eye would immediately recognize it’s a gold mine. The paint has peeled off at least somewhere on virtually every body panel, although the front end looks surprisingly good. It’s difficult to see in the low light at first in the video, but the interior doesn’t look too bad once Taylor shines a light on it. The work that does need to be done, like the splintering steering wheel rim and missing shifter knob are well worth the effort."

Funny enough, in the debris is a framed picture of a 1965 GT350."

Someone sure loved their Mustangs, but whey were they abandoned?"
