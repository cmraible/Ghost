According to police, they gave chase to the Mopar muscle car on November 1 at about 4:20 pm after the owner was carjacked. The victim called 911 and claimed men with guns took the vehicle from him on Seaglass Drive close to 15 Mile and Van Dyke."

A chase ensued and one patrol unit successfully deployed a stock stick, deflating at least one of the tires. With the car disabled, pursuing officers were able to stop the Dodge and arrest the driver."

We don’t need more details to reiterate what we’ve said countless times: car theft is bad and getting worse, particularly in areas like Detroit. Hellcats are big targets of criminals in part because they’re fast and fun, plus in part because they seem to be relatively easy to steal. They’re even easier to take at gunpoint, which is a real concern. Staying aware of your surroundings at all times and not letting criminals get the drop on you is your best defense. And remember, sitting in a parked vehicle is actually really dangerous."
