The last time they ‘fessed up, coughed up and I donated the proceeds to Cancer Research:\n\n> I work with PandoDaily on the financial side of the business. I want to apologize for the use of your photos without the proper credit/payment. This was an oversight on the part of our editorial team, and we’re taking steps to insure that this does not continue.\n> \n>  We will be happy to pay you for the use of the 3 photos on the website. We have a standard rate of $50 per photograph, illustration, or other graphic used on the site.\n\nTook months to get the money, though, and much chasing…\n\n\n## More Morin\n\nBut they’ve just done it again, with my image of Dave Morin of Path.\n\nHere’s the [image on the Pando site](http://pando.com/2015/05/31/a-defense-of-dave-morin/):\n\n![Pando copyright abuse](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/06/pando-copyright-abuse.jpg?resize=799%2C436 \"pando-copyright-abuse.jpg\")\n\nHere’s the story nicely surfacing in Google News – with my image:\n\n![Pando google news](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/06/pando-google-news.jpg?resize=587%2C167 \"pando-google-news.jpg\")\n\nAnd here’s my original in [my liveblog from 2011](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2011/12/le_web_dave_morins_path_from_facebook.html):\n\n![Dave morin onemanandhisblog](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/06/dave-morin-onemanandhisblog.jpg?resize=799%2C426 \"dave-morin-onemanandhisblog.jpg\")\n\nMy image. No credit. No payment.\n\nThe irony here, of course, is that Pando makes such a thing of their ethical superiority over other outlets. Let those without sin…\n\n\n## UPDATE: Photo changed\n\nNo contact from Pando, but all of a sudden, the photo’s changed:\n\n![Pando switched](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/06/pando-switched.jpg?resize=798%2C427 \"pando-switched.jpg\")\n\nI’ll update this if I hear anything from them.\n\n\n"
