<p><strong>Release Date </strong>February 12<br><strong>Developed By </strong>Nintendo<br><strong>Published By </strong>Nintendo<br><strong>Genre </strong>3D Platformer<br><strong>Players </strong>1 - 4</p>
<p>Fans have been wanting to see<em> Super Mario 3D World</em> be ported to Switch since we learned that almost every Wii U game would undoubtedly come to Nintendo’s hybrid console sooner or later. This title is currently the lowest selling 3D Mario game at 5.86 million copies, only 50,000 copies less than the GameCube’s <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> (not including its inclusion of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>). However, that will likely change come February 12 when the jolly four player co-op 3D mario title will be coming to Switch, along with the addition of Bowser’s Fury that we still don’t know much about expect that it has dark vibes and a lot more cat ears.</p>

Their mission is to use their variety of Jobs to ensure the safety and peace to the continent of Excillant.<br></p>
