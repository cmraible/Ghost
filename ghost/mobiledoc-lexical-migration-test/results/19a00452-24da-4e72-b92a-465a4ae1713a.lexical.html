<p>![Feb Stats](<a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com//Feb">http://www.onemanandhisblog.com//Feb</a> Stats.png "Feb Stats.png")</p>
<p>Here are the top five posts by traffic on One Man & His Blog in February:</p>
<h3 id="1-newsrewired-%E2%80%93-liz-heron-and-her-hashtag-science"><strong>1:Â <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/02/newsrw_-_liz_heron_and_her_hashtag_scien.html">news:rewired â€“ Liz Heron and her hashtag science</a></strong></h3>
<p>Not at all surprised by this one coming in top. Liz gave a superb and inspiring talk, with plenty of practical tips you could take away and implant in the way you worked straight away. If only all keynotes were this <em>useful</em>.</p>
<h3 id="2-newsrewired-%E2%80%93-making-money-from-content"><strong>2:Â <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/02/newsrw_-_making_money_from_content.html">news:rewired â€“ Making money from content</a></strong></h3>
<p>Well, blow me down. The media are interested in how to make money from their content? You flabbergast me. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<h3 id="3-5-thoughts-about-social-media-week-london"><strong>3:Â <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/02/5_thoughts_about_social_media_week_londo.html">5 thoughts about Social Media Week London</a></strong></h3>
<p>Iâ€™m pleased this one came so high. It provoked two interesting responses from <a href="http://www.broadstuff.com/archives/2589-Social-Media-Value-Chain-Snake-oil-and-Strategy.html">Alan Patrick</a> and <a href="http://www.antonymayfield.com/2012/02/29/the-fog-of-revolution-social-media-trends-2006-now/" title="Antony Mayfield">Antony Mayfield</a>, two gentlemen whose thinking I respect deeply, and triggered numerous conversations. Blog posts as social objects. ðŸ™‚</p>
<h3 id="4-redundancy-one-month-on"><strong>4:Â <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/02/redundancy_one_month_on.html">Redundancy: one month on</a></strong></h3>
<p>I was surprised to see this one so high. Who knew that so many people cared about the travails of my working life? Or, perhaps, theyâ€™re just interested in some honest blogging about what redundancy is like. Well, good news: Redundancy; two months on is on its way later today.</p>
<h3 id="5-newsrewired-%E2%80%93-social-media-optimisation"><strong>5:Â <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/02/newsrw_-_social_media_optimisation.html">news:rewired â€“ social media optimisation</a></strong></h3>
<p>Social media optimisation is the new search engine optimisation â€“ and may prove to be more significant in the long-term. The fact this post was so well read â€“ and shared â€“ suggests that the media business is finally starting to get its collective head around this fact.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of the spread, the top post got around double the traffic of the fifth placed post. Respect the power of Liz Heron. ðŸ˜‰</p>
