We have a special spot for these old workhorses like this 1931 Ford Model AA since they literally drove the American economy forward. To see these once-proud machines relegated to enormous lawn decorations just isn’t right, so we love seeing trucks like this one rescued and made to run again."

They were especially popular with anyone living in a rural area, particularly farmers, since they could handle the rugged roads (which we would call trails today) like a champ."

You can see the front wheels don’t have tires mounted, so right off the bat it’s obvious this truck is going to need some work. The owners have done some work to update the pickup, converting it to 12-volt, installing turn signals, and recovering the seat. However, it still has mechanical breaks, so that’s extra fun. Also, the Ford has a 4-speed transmission, which is a legitimate bonus."

But that’s part of the fun of working on vehicles which have just sat for years."

You also get to see these guys restore the paint and a few other cosmetic items. Despite some of the funky controls and extra procedures to operate an AA, you have to admire how these things were built to last. Will anyone say the same of the cars we’re making today in 100 years?"
