<p>When <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/274017/toyota-showcases-trucks-corollas-sema/">Toyota showcased custom Corollas and Tundras at the 2018 SEMA</a>, one of the highlights were the Toyota <a href="https://www.motor1.com/toyota/corolla-hatchback/">Corolla Hatchback</a> drift car by Papadakis Racing. It was a purpose-built race car made to excite whoever it was behind the wheel, but only a few could afford or at least have a chance to drive the car. Well, unless you're connected to Papadakis Racing, then chances are you've already driven the bonkers hatchback.</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the older brothers of the SEMA-showcased hatchback is now up for bid at <em>Bring A Trailer </em>– and you only have until next Saturday to bid for the car.</p>
<p>Just like the one showcased at last year's SEMA, the 2017 Corolla iM Formula Drift car features widebody kits, custom matte black and yellow livery with Rockstar Racing decals, and a converted rear-wheel drivetrain. built by Papadakis Racing and campaigned in the 2017 Formula Drift Pro Championship by racing driver Fredric Aasbo.</p>

<p>Powering the drift car is a longitudinally-mounted 2.7-liter turbo four-pot engine that sends power to the rear wheels via a G-Force four-speed manual transmission and a carbon fiber driveshaft. Aside from that, it also has a 10.5:1 JE pistons, a BorgWarner turbocharger, AEM fuel injection, a nitrous oxide system, and a custom RS-R suspension setup that allows 65 degrees of steering angle.</p>
