Detectives are asking for help from the local classic car enthusiast community. While the supplied photos portray it as gray, it was originally beige. It’s possible the car has been restored and resprayed, so it might be a different color by now."

Organized groups have capitalized on the situation in an effort to get rich quick. The thing is insurance fraud isn’t a victimless crime. Insurance providers inevitably have to pass the losses they take from fraud to consumers, meaning everyone literally pays the price with higher premiums and other drawbacks. Hopefully that fact alone will spur someone to do the right thing and point police toward the location of this Rover P5."
