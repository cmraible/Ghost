<p><a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">The new C8 Corvette</a> is easily the hottest car of 2020. Unfortunately, if you didn't order yours well ahead of time, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you have a chance at getting one. Best of all, it'll cost you far less than it would have otherwise. All you have to do is <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">buy some raffle tickets</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">International Motor Racing Research Center</a> was founded to preserve the history of motorsports. They're raffling off this 2020 Corvette to raise funds for their facility. That sounds like a great cause to us!</p>
<p>If you win, you get a beautiful Ceramic Matrix Gray Metallic 2020 Corvette with an Adrenaline Red leather interior. That's a classic, <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">timeless color combination</a>, and as close as you're going to get to the original 1953 Corvette.</p>

<p>Best of all, this Corvette includes our favorite option, the Z51 Performance Package. You'll need it, too, <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">as the prize</a> includes the ability to take delivery of their new Corvette at Watkins Glen International to receive professional driving instruction.</p>
<p>Winners can also opt for two days at the <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">Ron Fellows Performance Driving School </a>near Las Vegas. Either way, winners will have to make their own travel arrangements.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you don't want the car, there is a $50,000 cash option available to the winner. There's just a few days left to enter – <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">the contest</a> ends on December 3 – so don't waste any time.</p>
<p><a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingray?promo=25IMRRC2020">Click here</a>, and you can get 25% more entries, which makes your dollar go further. Just $25 gets you three entries (four with the code), but you get more tickets per dollar the more you spend. $100 gets you a grand total of 20 tickets with the promo. Good luck!</p>
