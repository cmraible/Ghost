Of course, this is a restomod which challenges the idea of old vs. new in a body that resembles both. You can thank the RingBrothers for that, as they've been making custom classic cars for quite some time. Nowadays, this Mustang could be called their golden goose as it is even crazier than anything we've seen.",

Looking at the modern examples rolling off the factory floor, you can see Ford has stuck to that mantra quite well. However, it's hard to argue a new Mustang looks half as good as this custom classic with its sleek styling and bold yet tasteful red paint job. Along with that incredible color combination, which fits perfectly with the wheels, this is also one of the best-looking convertible Mustangs on the internet. One picture, in particular, shows the vehicle offroad where the pony car looks at home with its wild horse brethren. ",

However, this engine will spin the classic-style wheels perfectly fine without all the usual issues with an older car. In a world of modern racers and crazy-fast factory performance cars, this great classic will be remembered by almost everyone who sees it. For that, we congratulate the RingBrothers for making one genuinely awesome American pony car.",
