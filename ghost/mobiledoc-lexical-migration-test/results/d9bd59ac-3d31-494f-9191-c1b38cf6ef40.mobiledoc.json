Under the hood is a fuel-injected 408 cubic-inch stroker V8 (based on a 351 Windsor block) that features a serious cam, aluminum heads and forged pistons. The Tremec five-speed manual sends this power to the rear wheels through a Ford nine-inch rear end with a Detroit locker differential, and four-wheel Wilwood disc brakes and coilovers ensure this Boss 302 handles better than the original."
