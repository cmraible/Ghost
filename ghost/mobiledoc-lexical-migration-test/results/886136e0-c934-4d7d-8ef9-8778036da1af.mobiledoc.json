While we don’t recommend taking the law into your own hands, that’s essentially what one guy in Charlotte, North Carolina did recently during a prolonged police chase. He received news alerts about the suspect who reportedly carjacked several vehicles, and when he saw the guy the vigilante sprung into action, ramming the suspect several times with his Toyota Tundra."

Instead, he pointed out that his Tundra was outfitted with a steel front bumper, so he figured it could take a few hits. Spurring him further was the information that the suspect had carjacked the SUV with a woman and child inside."

Likely he ruptured the radiator and maybe a few hoses. This is why pursuit vehicles have push bars instead of just steel bumpers."

Leading police on a chase for over two hours, he carjacked three more vehicles, including from a woman who was stopped in traffic. When the suspect crashed another stolen vehicle, she got out to see if everyone involved in the accident was okay. That’s when the suspect jumped into her SUV and took off. Finally, the suspect fled across the South Carolina border, then crashed into the side of a Ram pickup in an intersection. Footage of his arrest showed he had injuries to his left forearm."
