That’s the lesson at least 128 people learned the hard way when they fell victim to a Los Angeles man’s financial scheme. According to a release from the United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California, Geoffrey Eldridge Hull, 41, plead guilty to one count of wire fraud after his scheme was uncovered."

It can be tricky finding someone who not only wants to take over your vehicle lease but is able to do so. We can imagine many of these people who believed Hull when he told them he could help were feeling desperate, maybe because a sudden turn of events meant they could no longer afford to keep up on payments."

Vehicle owners would try to get their car back, which oftentimes were damaged and had exceeded the mileage as spelled out by the lease. When they posted negative reviews of the service, Hull changed the name of the company. Among the names he used were Exotic Lease Transfer, Luxe Lease Transfer, Shift Lease, Veer Lease, Torque Transfer, Haven Transfer, Early Lease, and Open Lease Transfer."
