Some have an engine or transmission that wasn’t used for the rest of the model, or maybe it sports a unique  interior. We have even seen the determining factor of rareness be brought down to a part as small and as inconsequential as a clock. That's not the case with this <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0122-487857/1994-porsche-911-turbo/">Porsche 911 Turbo</a>. This car is highly collectible for a big reason, and that's because you've probably already seen it on the big screen where it was used in the 1995 movie, "<em>Bad boys</em>."</p>
