The assumed intention of those who placed the tracker on his Mopar muscle car was to see where it was parked for the night, then to steal it. We’ve heard urban legends of this happening; however, this is the first news story of an actual incident we’ve been able to track down."

Then he drove to Warren and Berkley, then back to Novi before leaving again to visit a friend in Northville. When he left the friend’s house, his iPhone alerted him to the presence of an unknown AirTag which had been tracking his movements."

In other words, someone had placed it on his muscle car while he was doing the shopping. There was an option to make the tracker emit a sound so he could find it, but with the alarm going off Nelson couldn’t figure out where it was on his Dodge."

Nelson took the Mopar to a service center twice before one of the employees finally found the tracker, which was in the spare tire well. Since the spare is stored in the bottom of the locked trunk, that seemed like an impossible place for someone to reach."

However, until now we hadn’t found anything more than rumors that thieves are using Apple AirTags to track cars they want to steal later. The fact these thieves seem to have found a way to sneak the tracker into the trunk of Dodge Chargers is concerning, but we can’t confirm any of this story is true.  If you own a modern Charger, this might be something to look into or at least keep in mind."
