<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This is a fun and informative week on <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs podcasts. On <em>Lever Time,</em> I got the chance to interview comedian David Cross ‚Äî star of <em>Mr. Show</em> and <em>Arrested Development </em>and one of the most subversive comedians of the last twenty years. We discussed political comedy in the modern era, what‚Äôs really at the heart of the ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù debate, and what‚Äôs keeping him hopeful these days. In addition, Andrew Perez spoke with the executive director of the progressive think tank Groundwork Collaborative about the fight that‚Äôs brewing in Congress over lifting the debt ceiling, and how Republicans are already using inflation as a justification for cutting social programs. </p>
<p><em>The Audit</em> is still on hiatus, but will be back in a few weeks. Make sure to catch up on their first season, in which they audited the entirety of George W. Bush‚Äôs MasterClass. We promise it‚Äôs funny.</p>

<p>Rock the boat,</p>
