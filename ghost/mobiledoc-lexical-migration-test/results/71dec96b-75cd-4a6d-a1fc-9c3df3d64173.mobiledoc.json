As a member of the U.S. Army’s Armored Brigade Combat Team, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle has been one of the staple vehicles for some time. Known for being relatively fast and maneuverable, it’s supposed to traverse all kinds of terrain with little to no trouble. What’s more, "

          "Most people mistake the Bradley for a tank, and that’s an easy thing to do. Even though the Bradley has a turret and treads, it’s much smaller than a battle tank and it doesn’t pack the same kind of artillery punch. It can, however, do a tank turn where the tread on one side turns one direction and the other side turns the opposite direction, allowing the vehicle to turn around completely in a zero radius. The result is extreme agility for the battlefield."

The radiator is mounted to the top of the engine, allowing mechanics to pull out everything for servicing with greater ease. An electronically controlled transmission sits in front of the engine, with the two drive axles extending out of either side. In other words, the entire drivetrain is centralized, again making maintenance and servicing easier."

On the driver’s right side is a gated gear selector with everything labeled. Steering inputs are done through a yoke, making everything surprisingly relatively simple."

The main one is a 25mm M242 Bushmaster, a single-barrel chain gun with an integrated dual feed mechanism as well as a remote feed section. The gun is capable of shooting over 200 rounds a minute. Range is about 3,000 meters, depending on the ammunition used. For withering fire, an M240 machine gun is also mounted to the Bradley’s turret, firing 7.62mm rounds. There’s also an anti-tank missile launcher on the turret, which can travel up to 4 kilometers at almost Mach 1, just in case the crew encounters a tougher opponent."

          "While a good offense is often the best defense, the Bradley still has reactive armor, which has small charges located behind steel plates, blowing them off and away from the vehicle when enough force from something like RPG impacts. That redirects the kinetic energy away from the rest of the vehicle, plus there’s still an armored hull underneath those panels. Kevlar lining is also included under all that, just in case enemy rounds make their way through the hull. An automatic fire suppression system not too dissimilar to what you might know from motorsports is also equipped."

With a crew of 3, it can transport up to 7 infantry soldiers, not only transporting them to necessary points on the terrain but also providing cover fire as they unload and move out. With a large rear door which folds out, soldiers can storm out the back at a run, enjoying the extra protection the vehicle provides."

However, there is yet another push to replace it with something called the OMFV or Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle created by Oshkosh."
