Once you became too big to ride around in it, you would take the dog for a ride, and maybe haul around your lego collection to the next-door neighbor kid’s house. Or maybe your had parents like mine, and you got the rip off plastic version, ‘because safety’, either way, you gotta admit that you miss your wagon, as a pillar of your childhood nostalgia if nothing else. However, you can bring home a full size, fully functional street wagon and haul around all of the dogs you can find, plus the legos, and fit in there with them."

It’s said to go up to 70 mph, which seems a little intense. Impressively, it actually gets 19 mpg, which is a decent number for even today’s trucks, without the added paneling."
