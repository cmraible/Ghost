<p>In 2019, private equity giant KKR bought BrightSpring Health Services, one of the nation’s largest group home operators, for more than a billion dollars. KKR’s purchase of BrightSpring, and with it 600-plus residential facilities, came with great responsibility, given the health organization’s role in providing round-the-clock care for people with severe intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>As we highlight below, a damning new <em>BuzzFeed News</em> investigation — one of its last, given the company’s decision to <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonLeopold/status/1518709673968340992">dismantle its award-winning investigations team</a> — found that KKR appeared to prioritize business expansion over the health and safety of group home workers and residents. According to <em>BuzzFeed News,</em> by doing so, the firm created a crisis that left residents “consigned to live in squalor, denied basic medical care, or all but abandoned.”</p>

Some Vulnerable Residents Suffered Abuse And Neglect.</strong></a></strong>(BuzzFeed News) — <em>“In 2019, KKR took on a responsibility that was very different from selling cookies or batteries: caring for thousands of people with severe intellectual or developmental disabilities, some of whom cannot speak, wash, or feed themselves. With its $1.3 billion purchase of BrightSpring Health Services, one of the nation’s largest group home operators, KKR became the owner of more than 600 residential facilities serving people from California to West Virginia. Many residents have no family to look out for them. Almost all need round-the-clock care. They all depend on the company to keep them safe… But a yearlong </em>BuzzFeed News<em> investigation found that KKR focused on expanding the business even as a crisis mounted in its group home division, where conditions grew so dire that nurses and caretakers quit in droves, a state prohibited the company from accepting new residents, and some of the most vulnerable people in its care suffered and died.”</em></p>

I hated how it portrayed Beltway journalism as a game. How it reduced the project of government accountability to performative antagonism practiced daily by reporters in White House press briefings — a performance exposed annually at a dinner where the most powerful people in the world would rub elbows and yuck it up about funny ‘inside jokes’ like George W. Bush’s bungling of the Iraq War and the media’s culpability in helping him do it. Maybe because I was a reporter at the time, I always considered the dinner’s rottenness from the perspective of the relationship between the media and politicians, lamenting that images from the Washington Hilton of the press mingling with administration officials in black tie undercut the public’s faith in an independent media. But the further away I’ve gotten from the experience… the more I’ve considered how the dinner contributed in other, significant ways to the brokenness of our current political moment.”</em></p>

He argues the entire law should be thrown out because it violates his constitutional rights to bill patients directly for any 'balance of the fair value' of his services, according to his complaint. It’s a stunning position, given how popular the consumer protections are — the law is one of the few health care policies that politicians in both parties brag about, and even doctors groups whose members have taken a hit from the changes don’t outright oppose it.”</em></p>

The U.S. government should now do the same, and keep short-term political and national security priorities from jeopardizing hopes for a stable climate. That leash should ensure that any new production has a firm end date and uses all available tools to minimize emissions. It is theoretically possible that fossil fuel executives and their investors will voluntarily decide to bring on just enough new short-cycle production to meet European demand in the next few years, shut down L.N.G. terminals ahead of schedule or convert them all to export hydrogen and start storing captured carbon in freshly built pipeline infrastructure — all along a rigorous, science-based timeline. It’s just not likely unless the White House demands it.”</em></p>

But it didn’t protect the Fierros from owing thousands of dollars. So, when their son Jesús Fierro Jr. dislocated his shoulder, the Fierros — who hadn’t yet paid the bills for their own care — opted out of U.S. health care and headed south to the U.S.-Mexico border.”</em></p>

Shelagh and Rosemary don’t remember him ever hinting at that kind of doubt, though he wasn’t always a man who shared his feelings, and he became even less so in his later years. I do know that he was proud of his work, and maybe on some level he was right to be: under his leadership, from 1956 to 1961, Giant’s emissions dropped from roughly 2,700 kilograms of arsenic trioxide per day to 150. But he was still, formally, the supervisor of the mine’s dangerous pollution. Whether he helped or hurt or both, I’m left with the stubborn fact that five members of my family lived at Giant during some of its most toxic years, and only two survived past the age of sixty. On a much larger scale, the Yellowknives Dene are left to wonder exactly how much harm was done to them.”</em></p>

The jewel-encrusted edition of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám was taken aboard the RMS Titanic and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, exactly 110 years ago. A replacement was finished at great expense by the late 1930s but it was promptly incinerated by German bombers as the British capital was ravaged during the Blitz. The young man behind this extravagant presentation of the polymath Khayyám's poetry would soon drown in an English seaside resort. Would anyone dare to commission a third ‘Great Omar’?”</em></p>
