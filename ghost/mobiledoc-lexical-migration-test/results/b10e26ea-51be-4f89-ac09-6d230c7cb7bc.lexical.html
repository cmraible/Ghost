<hr>
<p>If you own a nice car, whether itâ€™s a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/classic-and-vintage">classic</a> or something <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/most-searched-supercars/">more modern</a>, then you likely have dealt with complete strangers touching it. Sometimes itâ€™s just someone admiring the car so much they canâ€™t help but touch the hood, trunk lid, or roof. But a lot of the time theyâ€™re posing with it so their friend can take a picture, and that often means full-on sitting on the fender, hood, or rear.</p>

<p>One YouTuber by the name of Eidan Sanker has come up with a pretty simple solution to this problem. Fed up with strangers using his C8 Corvette for photo ops, the guy started using his remote ignition feature to scare them off whenever he caught them in the act. Even better, he filmed some of their reactions and put them together in a video compilation.</p>
<p>A lot of people jumped up in fright at the sound of the exhaust roaring to life. One girl dropped her drink, which was in a glass bottle, shattering it all over the road. Sadly, nobody faceplanted on the pavement.</p>
<p>When we see a cool car in a parking lot and want to take a picture, we just take a picture without touching it. That seems to be a novel concept. Chalk it up to our parents teaching us that touching other peopleâ€™s cars without permission is rude and might earn you a bloody lip, but it never even crosses our minds to lay a finger on someone elseâ€™s ride.</p>
<p>This problem seems to be worse in some areas than others. We could chalk this up to cultural norms. In certain geographies itâ€™s just understood you donâ€™t touch another personâ€™s property, including their car, without express permission.</p>
