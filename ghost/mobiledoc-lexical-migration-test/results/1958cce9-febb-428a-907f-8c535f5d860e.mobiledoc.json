          "A highly desired car that is a favorite among collectors, the classic Shelby GT500s with the heavy-duty suspension and Cobra Jet 428 V8 engine are rare gems to behold. In fact, only 335 convertibles were built between 1969 and 1970. Making this bold beauty even rarer is that this 'special paint' Shelby GT500 convertible ordered from the factory is just one of nine in Grabber Yellow (3470-A). To narrow that number down even more, this is just one of 6 finished in the bold hue for 1970. The good news is that "

This setup was advertised as producing 335-horsepower, but that was highly underrated considering that the actual number was closer to 400-horsepower. This example is just one out of 54 convertibles to feature this powertrain for the 1970 model year. Handling is kept in check by the highly coveted heavy-duty competition suspension. Power steering allows for maneuvering turns easily, and power front disc brakes bring all that power to a stop."
