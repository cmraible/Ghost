<p><a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/vehicles/130/1967-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GT Motorcars</a> is pleased to announce the opportunity to own a stunning <a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/vehicles/130/1967-chevrolet-corvette?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1967 Chevrolet Corvette</a>. This car was given a full frame-off restoration and no expense or detail was spared. All "assembly line parts" were used to keep this Corvette as authentic as possible. In fact, this car is all numbers-matching. This specific Corvette was displayed at the Corvette Museum and includes a letter certifying its display. That is an accomplishment that should indicate this car's pristine condition.</p>

<p>Slathered in the original GM Lacquer Paint for judging, the body of this vintage 'Vette shines like a diamond. A set of original Kelsey Hayes wheels sit on all four corners and perfectly compliments iys exterior. Open the doors to an immaculate black interior that looks as if it has never been touched. Even the factory seats appear as if they have never been sat in. The inside of the car is as beautiful as the outside.</p>
<p>Under the hood sits a large numbers-matching 427cui V8 engine backed by a 4-speed manual transmission. This classic Corvette is no slouch with an output of 435-horsepower. Exhaust exits through factory chrome side pipes that stand out against the deep black paint. Stopping power is provided by factory power brakes, and a factory suspension keeps everything handling smoothly.</p>
<p>Not only is this classic Corvette show-worthy, it is the recipient of a few prestigious awards. This Corvette has been meticulously judged and has received the Bloomington Gold Certified and Multiple NCRS Top Flights. Even more, it was given the NCRS Performance Verification and NCRS Duntov Mark of Excellence Award.</p>
