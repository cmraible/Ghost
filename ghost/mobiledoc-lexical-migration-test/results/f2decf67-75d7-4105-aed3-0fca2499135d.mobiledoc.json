While the C8 Corvette undoubtedly is one, some might take exception to using the term for the Porsche 911. Purists feel only two-seaters should be called a sports car, arguing the 992 is a grand tourer since it’s a 2+2. We’d love to see those same people try sitting in that pathetic excuse of a backseat."

Porsche has stuck with tradition, keeping the boxer six in the rear of the 911. Now even the Carrera comes with twin turbochargers, but that still doesn’t help it contend with the output of the LT2, which outmuscles it with 495-horsepower versus 379-hp. But more power doesn’t necessarily mean quicker acceleration."
