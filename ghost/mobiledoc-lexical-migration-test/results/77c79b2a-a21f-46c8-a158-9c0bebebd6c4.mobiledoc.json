Unfortunately, a person in Kinderhook Township, Michigan learned that lesson the hard way when a man and woman showed up to look at a beautiful 1975 Pontiac Trans Am for sale. While the couple drove off with the classic American muscle car, the owner was left with nothing."

Plenty of readers will know this is a red flag. If you do get a check, even if it’s certified, you better meet in the parking lot of the bank it’s drawn from, go inside, and get the funds right then before handing over the title and keys. Unfortunately, this person trusted Martin and Plovie."
