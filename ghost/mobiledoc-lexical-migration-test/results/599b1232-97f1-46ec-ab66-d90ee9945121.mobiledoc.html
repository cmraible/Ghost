<p>It turns out AARP isn’t just the country’s leading advocacy organization for older Americans with a hugely successful magazine. It’s also “grown into a marketing and sales firm” that’s deeply in the pocket of UnitedHealth Group, the country’s largest health insurer. That’s according to <a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.111/bhs.da9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CTS-Report-2021-AARP-1.pdf">a recent report</a>, “How AARP Puts Profits over Patients — And Principles,” put out by a dark money group called Commitment to Seniors. But while elderly patients are in fact being thrown under the bus for the sake of corporate interests, Commitment to Seniors itself has a big role in that process.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>A 2017 Economic Policy Institute study <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/">found that</a> in the 10 most populous states, the typical wage theft victim <strong>loses on average $3,300 annually </strong>due to being paid less than the legally mandated minimum wage, causing them to make only $10,500 in average yearly wages.</p>
<p>The study further estimates that if similar levels of wage theft are found in other states, “the total wages stolen from workers due to minimum wage violations exceeds $15 billion each year.”</p>

<p>It turns out AARP isn’t just the country’s leading advocacy organization for older Americans with a hugely successful magazine. It’s also “grown into a marketing and sales firm” that’s deeply in the pocket of UnitedHealth Group, the country’s largest health insurer. That’s according to <a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.111/bhs.da9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CTS-Report-2021-AARP-1.pdf">a recent report</a>, “How AARP Puts Profits over Patients — And Principles,” put out by an organization called Commitment to Seniors.</p>
<p>Maybe Commitment to Seniors has a bit of a point. UnitedHealth Group does have an exclusive agreement with AARP, and AARP has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciagbarnes/2020/02/10/same-facts-but-different-findings-in-lawsuits-alleging-insurance-fraud-by-aarp/">faced</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-tosses-lawsuit-against-aarp-over-medigap-insurance-plans-2021-11-02/">lawsuits</a> for marketing United Medigap plans and taking a big cut on the commissions. But Commitment to Seniors’ parent organization has its own big health care industry backer — D.C.’s top pharmaceutical lobby — and has spent the last couple years battling federal policy proposals to lower drug prices on behalf of its Big Pharma donors.</p>
<p>Commitment to Seniors is a project of the dark money group American Commitment, which has been running a TV <a href="https://commitmenttoseniors.org/eliminating-medicare-protections-isnt-healthcare-reform/">ad</a> claiming Washington Democrats are “saying they want to reform Medicare, when they are actually looking to raid Medicare.” And Phil Kerpen, the group’s president with <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/12/16/whos-behind-the-group-that-flooded-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments/">longstanding ties</a> to the billionaire Koch Brothers’ network, recently wrote an <a href="https://www.dailypostathenian.com/opinion/article_fefc0d64-a0c1-5dd1-877e-5831b473e5ec.html">opinion piece</a> criticizing the popular Medicare drug pricing negotiation proposal in Democrats’ social spending legislation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Commitment to Seniors has been slamming AARP for <a href="https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2021/medicare-drug-prices.html">backing</a> H.R. 3, Democrats’ popular legislation to allow the government to negotiate Medicare drug prices.</p>
<p>According to Commitment to Seniors’ report on AARP, the advocacy group’s drug pricing reform agenda is due to its financial links to UnitedHealthcare. “Both AARP members and Congress should ask… whether the potential benefits to its insurance partner UnitedHealth — which under the bill could utilize the lower drug prices ‘negotiated’ by the federal government to increase its own profits — have anything to do with AARP’s policy stance,” noted the report.</p>
<p>Of course, the real beneficiaries of lower drug prices would be the American public, since people in the United States pay far more for drugs than residents of any other wealthy country — a state of affairs that Big Pharma wants to protect. Tax returns show Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the powerful Washington drug lobbying group, has donated at least $1.2 million to American Commitment since 2012.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/manchin-senate-spending-biden-87a445c2-cfdf-4bba-bc20-dd62db2a613a.html">According to <em>Axios</em></a><em>,</em> when Joe Manchin served as the governor of West Virginia between 2005 to 2010, he created a three-part test for any proposed policies he was being asked to support: “Are proposed programs paid for? Do they have bipartisan support? And do they solve a specific problem facing his constituents?”</p>
<p>Manchin apparently brought the criteria to Washington when he became a U.S. Senator in 2010. But if so, it didn’t take long for the corporate Democrat to abandon the third — and arguably most important — question he supposedly asked himself before deciding on policy stances. While a <a href="https://www.wboy.com/news/west-virginia/study-ranks-west-virginia-2nd-worst-in-u-s-for-dental-health/">study</a> from earlier this year ranks West Virginia 2nd worst in the country for dental health, mere months later, Manchin <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/573744-manchin-sends-warning-shot-on-plan-to-expand-medicare">took a stand against</a> a Build Back Better Act proposal to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing benefits.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

    <li><strong>DE BLASIO LEGACY SUFFERS A BLOW: </strong>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/08/19/medicare-advantage-privatized-health-care-new-york-city/">controversial</a> plans to switch a quarter million city retirees to a new Medicare Advantage plan are likely off the table, given state Supreme Court Justice Lyle Frank’s refusal to lift a temporary order he’d issued in October to halt the move. According to a Tuesday press release from the NYC Organization of Public Service Retirees — the municipal worker group that had filed a lawsuit against the proposal — the health plan switch was set to take effect on January 1 of next year. According to <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-nyc-de-blasio-legally-blocked-from-changing-city-retiree-health-plan-20211130-rqqqkrqfu5d2tkb7aiqyaar45m-story.html"><em>the New York Daily News</em></a>, Mayor-elect Eric Adams “will have the ability to pause or alter any potential de Blasio proposal that gets the green light from Frank before then.”</li>
    <li><strong>AMAZON’S BIG PANDEMIC LIE:</strong> According to a new <a href="https://thesoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hidden-Pandemic-Amazons-Secrecy-And-Obstruction-During-The-COVID-19-Crisis.pdf">report</a> from the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC), Amazon reported just 27 cases of “respiratory conditions” — a category that includes COVID-19 infections — in all of 2020 to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, back in October of last year, the company publicly announced it had identified 20,000 COVID-19 cases among its employees nationwide. As an Amazon worker from Whitestown, Indiana, told the SOC last May, “They continue to lie about the numbers in regards to COVID-19… They are not being honest about the number of employees who have the virus.”</li>

Despite President Biden’s promises on the campaign trail to end fracking, the report <a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2021/11/26/drilling-report-reveals-bidens-fracking-deception/#">falls short</a> of recommending an end to the detrimental practice. Instead, it’s <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2021/11/27/interior-department-oil-gas-leasing-report/">largely silent</a> on the fossil fuel industry’s climate impacts and calls for a relatively small increase in the fees polluters pay when extracting oil and gas from federal lands. “This shocking capitulation to the needs of corporate polluters is a clear sign that, when it comes to climate action, the White House does not actually mean what it says,” said Food & Water Watch Policy Director Mitch Jones.</li>
