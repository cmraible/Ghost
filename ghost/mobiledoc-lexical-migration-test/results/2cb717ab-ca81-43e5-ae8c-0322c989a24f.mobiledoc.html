<p>2020 was, let’s just say, an unprecedented year. In case you missed it, the pandemic hit the US hard and shut down many businesses as well as put a strain on the automotive industry. Translated to what was supposed to go down in the General Motors history books as the first year of the <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851915-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-">mid-engined Corvette</a>, this meant only half of the <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851915-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-">Corvettes planned</a> to be made actually were and the final production count ended at just 20,368 examples. 16,787 of those were Stingray coupes and just 3,581 were Stingray convertibles.</p>

<p>According to information from the National Corvette Museum, of the 16,787 coupes only 12,746 were equipped with the <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851915-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-">Stingray Performance Package</a> (better known as the Z51 package), 7,439 were 3LT models, 1,925 came with Midnight Painted Trident wheels, 934 were finished in rapid Blue, and <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851915-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-">only 560 came</a> with a Two Tone Blue Leather interior.</p>
<p>Chances are if a <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851915-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-">2020 Corvette</a> is spotted with all of these options, onlookers are turning their heads to see an example with less than 560 ever made like it. Moving into 2021, finding one still in the wrapper that has only been test driven a few miles is even more unlikely but Awesome Joe Auctions is offering just that.</p>
