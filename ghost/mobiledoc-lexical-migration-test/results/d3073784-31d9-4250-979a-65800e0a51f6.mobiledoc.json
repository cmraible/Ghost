Two surfboards mounted to the roof match the surf culture-inspired art, plus they feature more Rat Fink flair and information about the vehicle. A healthy patina on what could very well be the original paint, bumpers, and other trim pieces add to the vibe."

There are factory gauges and controls, but the three bench seats are covered with red and white upholstery, plus a grey and black mesh for a true custom appearance. More airbrushing on the door panels, plus Rat Fink floor coverings and headliner keep the theme of this vehicle strong. Ed Roth’s son signed the dashboard on the passenger side, too. Topping it all off is a kicking sound system with several speakers mounted under the seats and in the rear. Needless to say, this is a true party wagon perfect for taking tailgating, to car shows, or anywhere else."
