You may not know how old a doctor is when all you have is a name, so this information will give you some insight into his or her background and education credentials. The FSMB site shows medical school education and graduation dates. In some states, there will be more information about residency on their licensing site. For others, you'll get the information most quickly at a site like UCompareHealthcare.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: -14.740157480314956pt;\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">HOSPITAL AFFILIATIONS</span><span style=\"font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Doctors must apply for privileges to admit and treat patients at hospitals.

Problems for others may become problems for you. The FSMB site will list any actions related to medical malpractice, but you may want to do further web searches for the doctor by name for suits that may be pending. To find general commentary about a doctor's practice, you might turn to some of the online doctors' rating sites. However, be aware that these ratings are subjective and may have been influenced in many ways.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left: -14.740157480314956pt;\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">INVOLVEMENT IN RESEARCH</span><span style=\"font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:13pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">If the doctor is involved in medical research, then their involvement is important to you. Not all doctors participate in medical research, but if they are affiliated with academic or university medical centers, there is a good chance they are. On the one hand, it means they are learning more about your problem, ways to diagnose or treat it, and may be considered experts in the field. On the other hand, it may mean they are being paid by drug or other medical manufacturing companies and their recommendations to you might (or might not) be skewed.</span></p></li></ul></td></tr><tr style=\"height:0pt\"><td style=\"border-left:solid #e69138 1pt;border-right:solid #e69138 1pt;border-bottom:solid #e69138 1pt;vertical-align:top;background-color:#f9cb9c;padding:14.173228346456694pt 14.173228346456694pt 14.173228346456694pt 14.173228346456694pt;overflow:hidden;overflow-wrap:break-word;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;text-align: right;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;color:#b45f06;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Source:</span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;color:#212121;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"> </span><a href=\"https://www.verywellhealth.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;color:#783f04;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">https://www.verywellhealth.com/</span></a></p></td></tr></tbody></table>"
