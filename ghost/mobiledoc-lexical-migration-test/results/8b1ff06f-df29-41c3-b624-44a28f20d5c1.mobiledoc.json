Now, that should set off all kinds of red flags in your head, but this woman probably was just super excited, so she went through with the arrangement."

Why they didn’t just not return with the Hellcat during the test drive isn’t apparent. Thankfully, police did catch the suspect and a couple other people in the stolen Mopar muscle car a couple of days later. Not all cases end that happily."

Plus, surveillance cameras on the station will help capture the crime as it happens. Also, if someone wants to pay you with a check, we suggest doing the transaction at a bank where you can verify funds. Remember, the scammers and thieves are working overtime these days, so it pays to be paranoid."
