As the story goes, the owner of these cars first  purchased the 699th of the 700 Corvettes built for the 1955 model year,  and then later that year, his brother-in-law purchased number 700 from  the same dealership in Los Angeles. After the owner of no. 700 joined  the Navy in 1959, the owner of no. 699 bought the Corvette. This owner  kept the cars until he passed away in 1991, and then they were left to  his daughter's. After 61 years in the same family, both cars were sold  to the current owner in 2016."

Despite such a well-documented history, these  Corvettes haven't exactly lived a pampered life, which is shown by some  patina in the paint.
