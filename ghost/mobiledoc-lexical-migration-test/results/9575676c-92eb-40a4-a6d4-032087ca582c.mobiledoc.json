Another car might have tried and failed to predict future trends in the automotive industry, such as the C4 Corvette which had  an odd digital display dash that didn't really fit with the overall vehicle itself. Rather this  automobile was made in 1977, a fact the engineers are obviously quite proud of and wanted to showcase. For some this might be a negative as older cars are typically more worn out because of being driven for so long. However you would be hard-pressed to find many, if any, imperfections on the body or interior of this incredible American hatchback."

In the United States we like to focus on big V8 especially when it comes to the 1960s and 70s, but we sometimes forget that inline 6 engines have always been a fun platform for smaller vehicles. Thankfully this automobile went through a full engine restoration process which has the powertrain up and running like the mighty fighter it  was always supposed to be. In today's world of constant innovation and overwhelming modernity when it comes to automobiles, this is a wonderful example of how Engineers were able to make the best of what they had to work with in the 1970s. Somehow they figured out how to build something that would combine performance, good looks, and great gas mileage without breaking the bank. For this, the car will always be remembered as a great piece of American Automotive History."
