          "Back in the late '60s, Pontiac introduced a new sports car to the lineup and called it the Firebird.  Originally, Pontiac wanted to create a two-seater car based on their Banshee concept car, but GM feared that it would take sales away from the ever-popular Chevrolet Corvette. The solution was to introduce the Firebird into the pony car market and have it share the F-body platform and much of its sheet metal with its cousin, the Camaro. Of course, the Firebird was given a look and identity all its own. "

Unlike the Camaro, the Firebird's front bumper is integrated into the front end's overall design, and it featured slit-style taillights that were inspired by the '66-'67 Pontiac GTO. Protecting the cabin is a new white convertible top. A set of PMD wheels sit on all four corners."
