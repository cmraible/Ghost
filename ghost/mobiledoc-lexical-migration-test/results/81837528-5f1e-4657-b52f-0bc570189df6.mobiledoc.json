That’s especially true for Dodge Hellcats, be they of the Challenger or Charger persuasion. Now, Stellantis has tried to claim the propensity for criminals to target these high-powered muscle cars is overblown, while at the same time rolling out additional security measures for owners."

What wasn’t shocking to us was 2 of those cars were Dodge Charger Hellcats, one was a Dodge Challenger Hellcat, and the final one was a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. Is it a complete coincidence that all 4 are from the same automaker, Stellantis?"

On the black market these vehicles, either whole or parted, fetch a good amount because they’re in high demand. It’s the sad truth anyone who’s a Hellcat owner needs to understand."

One would think there would be enough security to keep thefts to a minimum, but in this day and age where car theft is rampant that’s not the case. In fact, the investigative team was told there was zero video of the car break-ins, so that means no meaningful surveillance. Gee, we can’t possibly understand why thieves are going hunting at the airport parking."

It gives them plenty of time to work on defeating your locks/alarm and to hack into your ignition to program a new key. This is why movie theaters, universities, malls, etc. are popular hunting grounds. If you have a cool, high-powered car it’s a better idea to take your beater to those places. Leaving a Hellcat unattended for hours at a time in such a place is probably not going to end well."

There was broken glass on the ground, a sure sign you’re dealing with a rookie, but this could be how these guys are getting experience, working up to stealing people’s Hellcats outside their home at night, in their employer’s parking lot, or wherever else. Hopefully the police catch them and the courts don’t just thrown them back on the street with a slap on the wrist. In the meantime, Hellcat owners and anyone who has a cool car needs to take extra steps to secure their ride."
