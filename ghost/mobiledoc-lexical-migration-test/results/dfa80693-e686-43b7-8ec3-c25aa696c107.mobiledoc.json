Well, some guy with a YouTube channel decided to take matters into his own hands, installing a gas generator on his Model 3. Instead of towing it with a trailer, this genius took out the rear window and plopped the generator there, which we’re sure cops are just going to love."

So hats off to this guy for recognizing the problem and trying to do something about it."

After all, he’s getting gas and burning it to create energy for driving, so why not just use a traditional engine and cut out all the batteries and electric motors? Plus, the generator is far noisier than pretty much any car engine. It seems like an unnecessarily complex solution to an otherwise easily solved problem."
