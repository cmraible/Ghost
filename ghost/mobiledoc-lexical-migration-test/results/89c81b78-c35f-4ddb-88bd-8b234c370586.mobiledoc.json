While some would get turned off by the fact this is a restomod with an LS swap and modern Camaro interior, there are still quite a few enthusiasts who like that sort of thing. What really kills this build for us is the huge 22-inch wheels and low-profile tires, which technically make this a donk, or so we’re told."

There’s no culture to get with these atrocities. Sure, that might sound harsh to some people but it’s true."

Yes, it’s really annoying when people who are filming things act like a kangaroo on its fifth espresso of the day, but this sort of thing is all too common on the internet. Maybe invest in a rig if you want to have better content for your YouTube channel? Anyway, check out the video if you want to see this car in greater detail."
