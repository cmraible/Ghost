Conti is one of the more popular Corvette YouTubers, but his upcoming stunt of jumping a C8 Corvette just might make him the most popular out there, or the most notorious."

He also disclosed that he “really screwed up the car” but that “it doesn’t really bother me.” That might make same Corvette fans upset, especially considering how many people would be willing to part with certain limbs to own a C8. However, Conti assures his followers he’s already fixed the mid-engine sports car, so it’s not headed to a salvage yard. However, the damage was apparently more severe than Conti was anticipating."
