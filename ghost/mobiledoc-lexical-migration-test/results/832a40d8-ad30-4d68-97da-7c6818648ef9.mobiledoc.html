<h3 id="california-mental-health-workers-go-on-strike">California Mental Health Workers Go On Strike</h3>
<p>As the <a href="https://ufw.org/">United Farm Workers union</a> embarks on a <a href="https://ufw.org/caagvotingchoiceact2022/">24-day, 335-mile march</a> to protect members‚Äô right to vote for a union, 2,000 Kaiser Northern California behavioral health workers of the National Union of Healthcare Workers <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/2022/08/kaiser-mental-health-worker-strike/">announced</a> an open-ended strike. Protesting how patients are being forced to wait months for therapy and urgent services, California mental health workers are demanding that Kaiser Permanente, the nation‚Äôs largest nonprofit health maintenance organization (HMO), improve conditions for workers and patients needing such care. </p>
<p>According to the union‚Äôs <a href="https://nuhw.org/more-than-2000-kaiser-permanente-mental-health-clinicians-to-start-open-ended-strike-august-15/">statement</a>, Kaiser reported $8.1 billion in profit last year, with $54 billion in reserves. ‚ÄúKaiser Permanente refuses to adequately invest in additional staff; take steps to reduce the burnout of current employees; and do what is necessary to bring its mental health clinics into parity with other health services the HMO provides,‚Äù said the statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPatients are getting ripped off while Kaiser‚Äôs coffers are bulging,‚Äù said Sal Rosselli, president of the National Union of Healthcare Workers, in the <a href="https://nuhw.org/more-than-2000-kaiser-permanente-mental-health-clinicians-to-start-open-ended-strike-august-15/">statement</a>. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt take striking lightly but it‚Äôs time to take a stand and make Kaiser spend some of its billions on mental health care.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="cities-in-southern-california-raise-wages-for-frontline-health-care-workers">Cities In Southern California Raise Wages For Frontline Health Care Workers</h3>
<p>This week, Long Beach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-04/more-california-cities-are-backing-25-an-hour-minimum-wages-for-these-workers-heres-why">became</a> the fourth city in Southern California to move forward with an ordinance to raise the minimum wage of health care workers in the private sector to $25 per hour. Rather than waiting to vote for the policy on a November ballot, the measure will be brought to a final vote before the Long Beach City Council next week.</p>
<p>After Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/07/09/la-enacts-25-minimum-wage-for-healthcare-workers/">signed</a> a $25-an-hour minimum wage ordinance for health care workers last month, the progress in Long Beach shows that the campaign led by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) United Healthcare Workers West to <a href="https://www.seiu-uhw.org/winning25minwage/">establish</a> a $25 minimum wage in ten Southern California cities is paying dividends.</p>
<h3 id="a-victory-for-abortion-rights-in-kansas">A Victory For Abortion Rights In Kansas</h3>
<p>In the country‚Äôs first vote post-<em>Roe v. Wade</em>, voters in Kansas soundly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-rights-referendum-reaction">rejected</a> an anti-abortion measure. The results were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/us/kansas-abortion-amendment.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur">deemed</a> a win for anti-abortion activists, especially since Republicans in the state hold legislative majorities and the vote took place at a time when only Republicans had competitive primaries.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church poured millions of dollars into the ballot measure campaign, ¬†while voters were subjected to a last-minute, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/02/kansas-abortion-texts/">misleading text message campaign</a> designed to confuse them.</p>
<p>Despite these odds, abortion rights supporters won by 59 percent, and according to <em>The</em><em>Guardian</em>, the referendum on abortion in Kansas drove up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-voter-turn-out-abortion-rights-election">record numbers</a> of voters at the polls.</p>
<h3 id="decarceration-efforts-in-hawaii">Decarceration Efforts In Hawaii</h3>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/07/25/hawaii-zero-girls-youth-correctional-facility/">result</a> of a ‚Äúsystem-wide push‚Äù for trauma-informed care, there are no longer any girls currently incarcerated in juvenile detention in Hawaii. Advocates for an end to incarceration for women and girls see this development as a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Nationally, the <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/girls-make-ever-growing-proportion-kids-juvenile-justice-system/">proportion</a> of young women incarcerated by the juvenile detention system has increased over the last two decades, but this development in Hawaii shows that care-based alternatives ‚Äî like housing and therapeutic programming ‚Äî to punishment are necessary to support young people who disproportionately targeted by the criminal justice system.</p>
<h3 id="librarians-score-a-major-raise">Librarians Score A Major Raise</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.leoglam.org">LEO-GLAM</a>, a union of librarians, archivists, and curators <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2022/07/17-salary-increase-part-of-first-ever-librarian-union-deal-with-university-of-michigan.html">won</a> a 17 percent salary bump in its first-ever bargaining deal with the University of Michigan. The deal includes individual pay raises of up to 30 percent for some of the lowest paid librarians, archivists, and curators. In addition to the salary gains, the workers won the right to be considered faculty, guaranteeing academic freedom for scholarly research, funds for professional development, and new guidelines for workload and remote work.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSince achieving recognition just over a year ago, our members have worked tirelessly to build a strong union grounded in collective action for a common good,‚Äù Meredith Kahn, GLAM campus chair, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2022/07/17-salary-increase-part-of-first-ever-librarian-union-deal-with-university-of-michigan.html">told</a><em>MLive</em>. ‚ÄúI hope our success can be a signal to others at the University and to information and cultural heritage professionals elsewhere.‚Äù</p>

<p>On Thursday, Democrats removed a measure from their Inflation Reduction Act that would limit a tax loophole benefiting wealthy private equity managers. Instead, they will reportedly include a one percent tax on stock buybacks, which divert funds to juice stock prices and enrich shareholders and executives.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take some time to read Aimee Nezhukumatathil‚Äôs poem about small moments, <em>‚Äú</em><a href="https://poets.org/poem/ode-sitting-booth"><em>Ode to Sitting in a Booth</em></a><em>‚Äù</em>:</p>
<p><em>It‚Äôs the closest thing to a cave. I have to resist</em></p>
<p><em>this wild urge to carve a name or word in it.</em><br></p>
<p><em>My favorite way to sit here is with cold vodka</em></p>
<p><em>& grapefruit juice & whatever bitter concoction</em><br></p>
<p><em>you‚Äôre sipping. Under the table I‚Äôll nudge you</em></p>
<p><em>with my heels ‚Äî a sign no stalactite or dripstone</em><br></p>
<p><em>will stop us. Bats do not require any energy</em></p>
<p><em>to claw-dangle upside down. All they need</em><br></p>
<p><em>is to relax & gravity & there‚Äôs plenty of both</em></p>
<p><em>swirling to go around. No matter how loud</em><br></p>
<p><em>this bar, within these three walls we can drop</em></p>
<p><em>straight into a very electric flight. We can</em><br></p>
<p><em>pretend we don‚Äôt answer to anyone ‚Äî including</em></p>
<p><em>the waitress ‚Äî & no one even knows where we are.</em></p>
