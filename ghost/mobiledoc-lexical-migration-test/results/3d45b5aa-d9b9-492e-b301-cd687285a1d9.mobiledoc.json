Starting with the Black Sparkle Metallic paint job from House of Kolors, this body features unique elements like the heat extractors on the hood, C6 ZR1-style carbon fiber fender vents and custom-made wheels (19-inch front, 20-inch rear) with a knock-off design. The rear quarter panels have also been subtly modified to house those taller and wider tires. The interior is also mostly stock looking with the exception of the late-model sport bucket seats."

For starters, it rides on a custom tube chassis using the basic suspension setup from a C7 with coilover shocks, but the heart of this beast is a 6.2-liter supercharged LT4 V8 from a C7 Z06 that's rated at 650 horsepower. Power is fed to those fat rear tires through a five-speed Tremec manual gearbox and a billet aluminum Dana 44 rear end with 3.50 gears."
