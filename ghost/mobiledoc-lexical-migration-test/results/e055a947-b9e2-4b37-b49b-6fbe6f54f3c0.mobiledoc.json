To be exact about 2000 hp flows through the engine Making it quite a difficult competitor on any dragstrip. Clearly, this car Was built for a purpose and that is shown throughout the entire engine bay. On top of that block you’ll find a set of Ford Voodoo heads whose presence mixes very nicely with the Comp Cams camshaft. Overall, this is a car set up to compete under some truly extreme circumstances."

You’d be exactly right and the insane acceleratory capabilities of this vehicle are what allowed it to do what it did next. Of course, that action was achieving 213 mph in a mere 6.66 seconds with very little difficulty. That means, according to the YouTuber that filmed the video, it might just be the fastest Coyote Mustang in the world. At the very least it might be the fastest one recorded making it a beautiful legend in the eyes of enthusiasts everywhere."
