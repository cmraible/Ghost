<h3 id="the-man-responsible">The Man Responsible</h3>
<p>By Mathew Cunningham-Cook</p>
<p>This week, the 4,761 residents of East Palestine, Ohio were left grappling with another instance of corporate greed poisoning communities, after a Norfolk Southern freight train derailment led to mass evacuations and a fiery “controlled release” of toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>What will be the public health impacts of this disaster on the local community? On the frontline workers who rushed in to contain the damage? Nobody knows for sure.</p>
<p>This is just the latest transportation woe to befall the country. In December, millions of Americans had their holiday travel plans derailed thanks to lax oversight and aggressive industry cost cutting. The previous month, the Biden administration forced a contract down struggling rail workers’ throats, despite the fact that many of them had rejected it, barring the workers from striking for their rights.</p>
<p>On top of that, you have the nation’s beleaguered freight rail industry, which moves about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/why-freight-railroads-are-so-successful-in-the-us.html">40 percent</a> of the country’s long distance freight volume, contributing to the nation’s brittle supply chains and fueling aggressive inflation.</p>
<p>In all these matters, all roads lead back to Pete Buttigieg, President Joe Biden’s transportation secretary.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>Buttigieg, as you might remember, was the McKinsey wunderkind who, as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/463614-young-turks-jonathan-larsen-documents-raise-questions-about-buttigiegs-record/">fired</a> a Black police chief and replaced him with a racist. He was also the candidate who lied about winning the Iowa caucus in his 2020 presidential campaign, and who removed every interesting idea from his platform the moment that corporate CEO cash started flooding into his campaign coffers.</p>

<p>Now, as the country’s top transportation official, he has ample regulatory powers at his disposal — but he has for the most part declined to use them, or done so only in the face of great pressure.</p>
<p>Take for example, his department’s response to the 2022 holiday airline crisis. Despite the thousands of flights canceled by airlines during the holidays, Buttigieg has yet to assess any fines on the industry for the morass. The Transportation Department has also failed to fine any major U.S. airlines for routinely posting flights they can’t fly due to staffing shortages and canceling those flights at the last minute — even after United Airlines’ CEO <a href="__GHOST_URL__/airline-ceo-admits-ticket-scam-permitted-by-buttigieg/">called out</a> this practice last month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, instead of championing the critical role played by the country’s 100,000-plus railroad workers, Buttigieg took a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/transportation-secretary-buttigieg-took-personal-trip-europe-intense-rail-strike-negotiations">back seat</a> in the Biden administration’s railroad union negotiations, <a href="https://www.masslive.com/politics/2022/09/marty-walsh-reveals-how-the-rail-strike-was-averted-food-was-involved.html">delegating</a> much of the work to Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.</p>
<p>Buttigieg’s silence on the massive railroad labor dispute was critical in maintaining the corporate media’s preferred <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cheat-sheet-whats-really-driving-inflation/">narrative</a> about inflation: that the inflation problem was <em>not</em> the result of supply chain bottlenecks and corporate greed — no, it was that workers’ wages <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-declares-war-on-workers/">were rising</a> too quickly!</p>
<p>Even CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/economy/freight-railroad-service-problems/index.html">noted</a>,“Many of the problems tangling up the supply chain, driving up prices, and slowing the economy can be traced to the steady decline in freight rail service in recent years.” More specifically, the federal Surface Transportation Board — which is independent of Buttigieg’s department — has drawn attention to the fact that “embargoes,” or significant delays that dramatically slow down rail traffic, <a href="https://www.stb.gov/news-communications/latest-news/pr-22-49/">increased</a> from five in 2017 to more than 1,000 in 2022 at Union Pacific, the country’s second-largest railroad.</p>
<p>In a “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8a7cdc0d-99aa-4ef6-ba9a-fd1a1180dc82">just in time</a>” <a href="https://wagingnonviolence.org/2012/10/how-workers-are-using-globalization-against-walmart/">economy</a>, whereby inventory is kept moving as quickly as possible with as few workers as possible, embargoes mean price increases.</p>
<p>But by sidelining critical discussions about supply chains — including failing to acknowledge the critical role that railroad delays played in price increases — Buttigieg and his staff refused to participate in an honest discussion about inflation. Meanwhile, our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/powell-lets-wall-street-pay-skyrocket-while-targeting-workers-wages/">private equity executive</a><em>cum</em> Fed Chair, Jay Powell, was able to convince the people who mattered that the only way to address inflationary pressures was to “get wages down.” The Fed hiked interest rates <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/">six</a> times from March through November, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-chairs-november-surprise/">resulting</a> in Republicans taking control of the House.</p>
<p>Now, back to Ohio. Instead of cracking down on railroad abuses, Buttigieg has remained in the background — although his Federal Railroad Administration has, to its credit, <a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/train-crew-staffing-nprm#:~:text=A%20minimum%20requirement%20of%20two,the%20public%2C%20or%20the%20environment.">revived</a> a long-overdue rule mandating a minimum two-person crew on trains. But there has been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/there-will-be-more-derailments/">no effort</a> from Buttigieg to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/">revive an Obama-era rule</a>, later killed by Donald Trump, mandating further adoption of electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes, which could have limited or even prevented the Ohio disaster — even after a former federal safety official <a href="__GHOST_URL__/there-will-be-more-derailments/">warned</a> Congress that without the better brakes, “there will be more derailments [and] more releases of hazardous materials.”</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>Instead, Buttigieg’s transportation regulators have been considering a rail-industry-backed proposal that could weaken existing brake safety rules.</p>
<p>What would happen if Buttigieg was held accountable for his failures and shown the door? For one thing, there are enormously qualified successors waiting in the wings. For example, former House Transportation Committee Chair Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), who recently retired, is extremely knowledgeable and boasts strong progressive credentials, as was showcased in his recent <a href="https://www.callin.com/episode/how-to-fix-americas-transit-woes-w-peter-defazio-yqcJoTSMub">appearance</a> on our weekly Callin show, <em>Lever Live.</em></p>
<p>But competence and knowledge aren’t what wins the day in Washington — it’s fealty to wealthy donors. So, for the time being, you should expect Buttigieg, the man who should be held primarily responsible for all this, to remain right where he is. But in the meantime, you can count on us at <em>The Lever </em>to keep investigating.</p>
