According to videos posted on social media, dozens of drivers were stuck on the interstate while others blocked the road to do burnouts."

These illegal acts have garnered the attention of Charlotte City Council Member Tariq Bokhari, who stated his plans to talk with the district attorney about the problem. “We have to figure out ways to get more proactive or lives will be lost,” Bokhari said. For those of you out there that still don’t see this as an issue that affects all of us, take this in. A council member is a policy maker and when they get involved it usually results in overreach. A prime example of this is the super speeder laws of Georgia, which bump the fine for driving over 85-mph on the interstate (that's only 10-mph over on some roads) up by $200 and gave the DDS the right to revoke licenses."
