<p>As we rapidly approach the country‚Äôs November midterm elections, corporate media seems uninterested in one of the biggest threats to democracy: Billionaires and Big Business using huge sums of money to try to secretly buy elections on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>Increasingly, a small handful of donors hold outsized influence in American elections, thanks in large part to the Supreme Court‚Äôs 2010 ruling in <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, </em>which gave wealthy donors and special interest groups license to spend unlimited cash on elections. This year is no exception.</p>
<p>We know little to nothing about some of the biggest donors this cycle ‚Äî and that is by design. These political advocacy nonprofits, as <em>The Lever</em> has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-secretive-billionaire-handed-his-fortune-to-the-architect-of-the-right-wing-takeover-of-the-courts/">extensively</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/barre-seids-attack-philanthropy/">reported</a>, are 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, named after the corresponding tax code section that deems them tax-exempt. More commonly, they are known as dark money groups, because they are not required to publicly disclose their donors. </p>
<p>In this first edition of Election Insider, we break down the biggest spenders in the 2022 election cycle, from dark money groups to billionaire chief executives.</p>
<p>So far in the 2021-2022 midterm election cycle, <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_dyn_SuperPACs.aspx?&td=3_2">billions of dollars</a> have been funneled from dark money groups and other interests into super PACs, which can spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections. Republican super PAC donations have so far totaled $865 million, while donations to Democratic super PACs have hit $2.7 billion. Below, we highlight the top donors fueling each party, according to data from Political MoneyLine.</p>
<h3 id="top-five-2022-cycle-donors-to-republican-super-pacs">TOP FIVE 2022 CYCLE DONORS TO REPUBLICAN SUPER PACS:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein</strong>, founders of shipping supply giant Uline, have donated <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_dyn_superpacsdetails.aspx?sCycle=2022&sCID=1137343">$50.5 million</a> to conservative outside groups. The donor couple has spent big money over the last several years funding the GOP in Wisconsin and nationwide, going so far as to feed the coffers of the most extreme right-members of Congress, including QAnon conspiracy theory supporter <a href="https://twitter.com/geostanley/status/1360004572740214787">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green</a> of Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ken Griffin</strong>, founder and head of Chicago-based hedge fund behemoth Citadel, along with his ex-wife <strong>Anne Dias</strong>, have donated <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_dyn_superpacsdetails.aspx?sCycle=2022&sCID=42873">$48 million</a> to Republican groups. In total, hedge funds have spent more than <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F2700&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U&mem=Y&cycle=2022.">$10 million</a> on federal candidates during the current cycle, according to OpenSecrets. This part of the finance industry has an interest in policy decisions on tax issues like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-stealth-gift-to-wall-street-donors/">carried interest loophole</a>, which allows private equity and some hedge fund managers to enjoy much lower taxes on some of their income.</p><!--members-only-->
<p><strong>3. American Action Network</strong>, the House GOP‚Äôs dark money arm that does not disclose its donors, has donated <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_dyn_superpacsdetails.aspx?sCycle=2022&sCID=113729329">$34 million</a>. Most of that money has gone to its sister super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, which recently launched a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/26/gop-ad-biden-student-loan-plan">$350,000 national ad blitz</a> slamming President Joe Biden for his decision to cancel some student loan debt.</p>

<p><strong>4. One Nation</strong>, the dark money group affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that helped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-slush-fund-bankrolling-the-insurrectionist/">bankroll insurrectionist GOP senators</a>, has donated <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_dyn_superpacsdetails.aspx?sCycle=2022&sCID=1173762286">$33.5 million</a> to its affiliated super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund. One Nation is largely focused on five competitive Senate races, having spent <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/25/mcconnell-dark-money-spending-senate">more than $17 million</a> alone on trying to crush Sen. Raphael Warnock‚Äôs (D-Ga.) chances of keeping his seat this November. The <em>Washington Examiner</em><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/mitch-mcconnell-allies-gird-to-defend-senate-majority-amid-impeachment-uncertainty">described</a> One Nation as ‚Äúthe primary source of outside air cover for Senate Republicans.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>5. Jeff Yass</strong>, mega-wealthy founder of Wall Street trading giant Susquehanna International Group who is notorious for sketchy <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/jeff-yass-susquehanna-tiktok-tax-avoidance">tax avoidance</a> and his championing of school privatization, has donated <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_dyn_superpacsdetails.aspx?sCycle=2022&sCID=66231">$30 million</a> to conservative causes. According to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/jeff-yass-susquehanna-tiktok-tax-avoidance"><em>ProPublica</em></a>, since the passage of former President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2017 law that massively cut taxes for the rich, Yass has backed several pro-Trump candidates. (Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, longtime friend of Ohio Senate GOP candidate <a href="__GHOST_URL__/j-d-vances-wall-street-tax-dodge/">J.D. Vance</a>, has also donated $30 million to Republican groups.)</p>
<h3 id="top-five-2022-cycle-donors-to-democratic-super-pacs">TOP FIVE 2022 CYCLE DONORS TO DEMOCRATIC SUPER PACS:</h3>
<p><strong>1. George Soros</strong>, billionaire hedge fund tycoon and long-time Democratic megadonor, tops the list with a whopping $127 million in political contributions so far this election season.</p>
<p><strong>2. Samuel Bankman-Fried</strong> made billions launching the cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX, and while the 30-year-old entrepreneur has pledged to use his fortune to promote the concept of ‚Äúeffective altruism,‚Äù much of the $35 million he‚Äôs spent this cycle could encourage his politician recipients to shield crypto from increased regulation, even as crypto has proven to be highly speculative, worsening inequality and the climate crisis alike. Bankman-Fried poured $4 million into the Anthony Scaramucci-backed GMI PAC, focused on supporting crypto-friendly candidates. He also used $27 million to almost wholly fund the ‚Äúpandemic prevention‚Äù super PAC Protect Our Future, which appears to have done more to support Bankman-Fried‚Äôs favored candidates than it has to address specific pandemic risks. <br><br>Bankman-Fried‚Äôs bankrolling of establishment candidates could be hurting progressives. He contributed more than $1 million to help corporate-backed Shontel Brown defeat progressive Nina Turner in the Democratic primary for Ohio‚Äôs 11th congressional district, and spent more than $11 million trying ‚Äî and failing ‚Äî to stop progressive Oregon state Rep. Andrea Salinas from winning the Democratic primary in the state‚Äôs 6th congressional district. He also shelled out a quarter million to the pro-Israel Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) PAC that has spent millions to crush progressives this year, and has donated $1.4 million to the Republican-aligned America United PAC and the Alabama Conservatives Fund.</p>

<p><strong>3. Majority Forward</strong>, a Democratic Party-aligned dark money group affiliated with Senate Majority PAC, has donated $28 million to groups boosting Senate Democratic candidates, as well as promoting voter turnout.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fund for Policy Reform</strong>, a dark money group founded and funded by Soros that focuses on supporting criminal justice reform and election administration policy efforts, has donated $25 million to another Soros-backed group.</p>
<p><strong>5. Democratic Governors Association</strong>, the group charged with supporting the party‚Äôs gubernatorial candidates, has poured $23 million into this year‚Äôs races. The organization is particularly focused on beating back Republicans in states where abortion access is endangered in light of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<h3 id="key-2022-cycle-donation-recipients">KEY 2022 CYCLE DONATION RECIPIENTS</h3>
<p>Most of the donors listed above have given to super PACs. These efforts have turned these operations into political juggernauts, with the power to drastically shape elections and in turn, federal and state policy outcomes<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The following political organizations are some of the biggest donation recipients to date for the 2022 midterms and boast noteworthy top donors, according to data from OpenSecrets and Political MoneyLine.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¢ Senate Majority PAC</strong>, a Democratic super PAC that boosts Senate campaigns, has brought in <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/senate-majority-pac/C00484642/summary/2022">$149 million this cycle</a>. Majority Forward, the Democratic Senate‚Äôs dark money arm, has supplied $27.3 million of that amount. Other top donors include Chicago-based Newsweb Corporation founder and billionaire Fred Eychaner, who has donated $8 million, as well as the Greater New York Hospital Association, which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">flooded</a> former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs campaign coffers before he signed legislation shielding hospital and nursing-home executives from the threat of COVID-related lawsuits. Renaissance Technologies hedge fund founder and billionaire James Simon, and Indiana-based Deborah Simon of <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/19/simon-sisters-donations-democrats-828606">shopping mall business fame</a>, have each given $3 million.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¢ House Majority PAC</strong>, which seeks to retain a Democratic House Majority, has raised <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/house-majority-pac/C00495028/summary/2022">$85 million</a>, with billionaires Eychaner, Bankman-Fried, and Simon collectively contributing $17.5 million to the organization. In addition, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/25/dems-launch-secret-money-ad-blitz-to-back-house-majority-1436416">House Majority Forward</a>, a dark money group launched in 2019 and is affiliated with House Majority PAC, has contributed $4 million. George Marcus, chairman of the massive real estate brokerage Marcus & Millichap and the real estate investment trust Essex Property Trust, has also spent big this cycle with a $2 million donation ‚Äî <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-scored-real-estate-cash-before-letting-eviction-ban-expire/">half of which</a> came in just before Democrats let the pandemic eviction moratorium lapse.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¢ The Republican Governors Association</strong> has raked in <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_MG_527_Filer.aspx?&sEIN=113655877&sCycle=2022">$120 million</a> so far. The top donor, with a $3 million contribution, is Sedona Magnet LLC, a company registered in Nevada whose sole officer is <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_nv/E10377022020-3">Robert Bigelow</a>, <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/pac-led-by-former-lt-gov-hutchison-reloads-ahead-of-2022-midterms-with-2-million-contribution">owner of</a> Budget Suites of America and hundreds of real estate properties and developments. Bigelow is also an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">extra-terrestrial enthusiast</a>, having pressed former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to initiate a government study of UFOs. Other notable donors include the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which also gave $3 million, likely to protect its <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/08/18/biden-administration-says-florida-seminole-tribe-gambling-deal-should-get-ok/">lucrative gaming compact</a> with the state of Florida, and health care giant Centene Corporation, which donated nearly $1.5 million and stands to benefit from potential new Medicaid contracts and state tax incentives. Stockbroker giant Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and his wife Marlene, and Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus and his wife Wilma, have also donated significant sums.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¢ The Democratic Governors Association</strong>, which has brought in a whopping <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_MG_527_Filer.aspx?&sEIN=521304889&sCycle=2022">$112 million</a><strong></strong>this cycle,<strong></strong>is among the biggest donors in key gubernatorial races this year. It‚Äôs a perfect example of how these types of groups funnel money back and forth to serve a broader partisan agenda. Illinois Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker tops the list of the association‚Äôs supporters, with a donation of $24 million. As <em>The Lever</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/pritzkers-nra-hospitality/">reported</a>, Pritzker and his administration have still not passed an assault weapons ban, despite his rhetoric suggesting interest in doing so. His family hotel chain, Hyatt Hotels, has hosted NRA events for years, including one this May. Dark money group <a href="https://www.americaworksusa.org/">America Works USA</a> is another big-ticket donor, having contributed $6.5 million this cycle.</p>

<p><strong>‚Ä¢ The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee</strong>, which focuses on securing Democratic majorities in statehouses nationwide,<strong></strong>has raised <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_MG_527_Filer.aspx?&sEIN=521870839&sCycle=2022">$31 million</a>, with dark money group Emerging American Majorities ‚Äî which is interested in improving diversity in state legislatures ‚Äî having contributed upwards of $600,000. Tobacco giant Altria Group has donated a similar amount, since the company is a huge investor in e-cigarette giant Juul, which has been subject to growing scrutiny from state and federal lawmakers. Other top donors include major unions representing workers in the public sector, telecommunications industry, and electrical industry.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¢ The Republican State Leadership Committee</strong>, the Republican counterpart to the DLCC, has received <a href="https://politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_MG_527_Filer.aspx?&sEIN=050532524&sCycle=2022">$43 million</a> in political contributions. Corporate lobbying behemoth U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its affiliates have donated more than $1.5 million to protect business interests at state capitols, while tobacco companies Altria and British American Tobacco have together given $1.6 million. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dark-money-went-in-supreme-court-rulings-are-coming-out/">The Concord Fund</a>, the powerful right-wing dark money group led by anti-abortion activist Leonard Leo, has donated $1.1 million. And oil and gas giant Chevron, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/18/climate-change-inflation-reduction-act-oil-gas/7837956001/">stands to benefit</a> from the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act thanks to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-just-admitted-a-taboo-truth/">pseudo-Democratic</a> Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) conceding to his industry donors‚Äô demands, donated $778,000.</p>
<p>All in all, there‚Äôs a lot to keep an eye out for in the midterms in the coming weeks ‚Äî and <em>The Lever</em> will be here to supply you with everything you need to know as these key elections unfold. </p>
