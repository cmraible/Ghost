It’s also one-of-a-kind with a whole range of options. Perhaps the most expensive and impressive of them is a full visual exposed carbon fiber body, which cost $297,575. To show that off, the car wears Transparent Fux Green paint plus Emerald Green tinted carbon, and the combination is amazing."

The result is a peak 789-horsepower and 590 lb.-ft. of torque. Using a 7-speed dual-clutch SSG transmission, this McLaren can do 0-60 in 2.7 seconds and hit 211 mph."

It’s been engineered to handle excellently on tracks at high speeds, offering the kind of precision you normally wouldn’t expect from a road car. A carbon-fiber Monocage III chassis with extruded aluminum subframe, electrohydraulic rack-and-pinion steering, as well as aero enhancements like the prominent front splitter, diffuser, and rear wing help greatly with that objective."

White leather with green contrast stitching graces the seats, door panels, dash, and steering wheel. A Bowers and Wilkins seven-speaker sound system is great for cruising through the city, while the McLaren Track Telemetry system will help you shave off valuable seconds from your hot lap times."
