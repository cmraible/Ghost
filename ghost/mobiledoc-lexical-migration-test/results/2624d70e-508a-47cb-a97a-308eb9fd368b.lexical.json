It’s pumping everyone up for a technology which is admittedly in its infancy (ok, maybe toddlerhood now) and accounts for a small sliver of new car sales currently. Sure, they say it can be scaled quickly, but those are just words, not actions. Can automakers truly supply enough batteries to grow EVs into even 10-percent of annual vehicles sales? There’s serious doubt they can. However, governments around the world seem to think they can decree such a thing and it will happen. Those laws and regulations don’t solve the battery supply issue or the key questions about generating enough electricity to keep those cars charged, let alone building the infrastructure for conveniently charging them on the go. There are far more moving parts to the rollout of such impactful technology than the everything-is-sunshine-when-it-comes-to-EVs crowd would like everyone to believe.
