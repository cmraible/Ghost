Found by AMMO NYC after it and another car sat in a parking garage for 16 years, the thing has accumulated plenty of dirt and grime. The plan is to clean it up and flip it."

However, time has been pretty kind to these cars and interest in them has been on the rise, so cleaning this one up to make an excellent presentation is completely worth the effort."

And while it’s not the fastest or sexiest thing, it would make a good first classic for someone wanting to get into the hobby, if they’re into Mercedes and such. This just goes to show that you don’t have to be rich to be a gearhead, you just have to go for options not everyone else is piling onto."
