<p>When it comes to interesting modern-day vehicles, a two-wheel drive, four-cylinder <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Nissan/Frontier">Nissan Frontier</a> probably ranks about as high as a Toyota Prius when it comes to enthusiasts. That being said, taking care of any old vehicle is a daunting task, so we have to give proper credit for a job well done, and that's exactly what this unassuming 2007 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Nissan">Nissan</a> Frontier has experienced with a single owner who has driven the truck more than 1,000,000 miles!</p>

<p>On January 27, 2020, Brian Murphy, an independent delivery driver in the Chicago area, joined the million-miler club, and Nissan didn't miss the chance to celebrate the occasion. Averaging 77,000 miles per year over the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/category/truck/">truck</a>'s 13-year life so far, Murphy manages this mileage by driving Â 12-14 hours and 300-400 miles per day while delivering packages. His monthly average is around 6,400 miles, but he says that he's driven as much as 12,000 miles in a single month. That's the almost average for miles that Americans drive in an entire year!</p>
<p>As joyous as this feat was, the moment was sort of anticlimactic as Murphy was deprived of watching the odometer roll back to all zeros as it stayed stuck on 999,999; now only the trip meter track the truck's mileage. Surprisingly, the Frontier 4x2 King Cab is still on its original engine and transmission, and even the list of maintenance and repairs are impressive for the mileage. Murphy changes the oil himself every 10,000 miles, and major required repairs include original parts including the alternator (at 400,000 miles), water pump (at 600,000 miles) and clutch (at 601,000 miles), while the timing chain was replaced at 700,000 miles as preventative maintenance. Despite driving that many miles and living in the Chicago area, the truck is surprisingly clean.</p>

<p>In no way coincidental, this news comes during the Chicago Auto Show, where Nissan confirmed that the next-gen Frontier will be introduced next year. The current-generation Frontier is already halfway to classic status as it debut in 2005! To celebrate the accomplishment, Nissan gave Murphy the keys to a brand-new not-on-sale-yet 2020 Frontier, according to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8PZsduHj1H/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" rel="noopener">post on Instagram</a>!</p>
