<hr>
<p>Even among other Corvettes, this <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8KE/1986-chevrolet-corvette-indianapolis-500-pace-car">1986 Chevrolet Corvette Indianapolis 500 Pace Car</a> is special. The fact it’s a limited-edition pace car definitely helps, but so does the low 1,161 miles and show-worthy condition. Part of the <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/auctions/4-DE84I/motorious-convertibles-only-online-auction">Motorious Convertibles Only Auction</a> starting April 24, this would be both an great investment and entertaining vehicle to own.</p>

<p>As you no doubt have noticed, because it hits you with emphasis, this car has a nice, bright yellow exterior. Complementing that perfectly is the black convertible top. Side graphics make everyone aware this is not your average C4. The factory aluminum wheels look just as perfect as the rest of the car.</p>

<p>If you know your ‘Vettes well, then you’re aware this car has the tuned port injected 5.7-liter V8. Paired to that is a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, so technically anyone could manage to drive it without problems.</p>

<p>Even the grey leather interior has all the original equipment intact and functioning as designed. There are plenty of luxuries straight from the factory, like electric seat adjustments, air conditioning, Bose sound system, power windows/locks, power steering, and even halogen automatic cornering headlights. For 1986 this was pretty futuristic, showing off the might of General Motors at the time.</p>
