          " is small but diverse. With the inclusion of different biomes, each with their own unique plants and environmental conditions that affect gameplay, this inclusion serves to make the small map feel much bigger and break up some of the repetition. Each environment is complete with NPCs that dress and speak differently; different plants, animals and weather, it all feels like a big step forward for the series and is hopefully the new standard. The weather feature also affects how quickly your stamina drains and adds a layer of realism to this chibi-farming simulator. Finding all the new plants felt like filling up a Pokédex and kept me engaged throughout my entire playthrough."

Between this and the bland dialogue, the story suffers from the same blight as the rest of the game: repetition to the point of being forgettable. Sadly, the NPCs are about as stimulating as watching your virtual grass grow: there wasn’t enough substance in any conversation to make me want to talk to anyone. Luckily if you just want to be a hermit and grow vegetables you can now sell your items by placing them in a dropbox, which is either a cruel reference to the hellscape 2020 was, a convenient way to sell vegetables or both."
