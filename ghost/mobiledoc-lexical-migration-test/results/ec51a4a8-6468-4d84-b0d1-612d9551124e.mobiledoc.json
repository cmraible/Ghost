The whole point of the Corvette has always been accessible performance, so don’t hold your breath on GM using anything from this for the C9. With a mere 24 Ares S1 Project cars planned, there’s no doubt these will be far more expensive than any C8 on the market."

The cockpit sits far forward and the hood slopes rapidly forward to a low front splitter, plus the side mirrors extend out like those on many of today’s hypercars. Designers even placed dual exhaust tips in the rear engine cover, not in the massive diffuser."
