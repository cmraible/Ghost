<p>Porsche is probably best known for its 911 range, and the 356 before that, but over the year the German marque has diversified beyond sports cars. The Panamera was a controversial car when it launched, but there was no denying that this four-door supercar packed pure <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche/">Porsche</a> DNA. <a href="https://www.texasmotorworks7.com/vehicles/67/2012-porsche-panamera-4dr-hb-turbo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Texas Motor Works</a> is currently listing one of the most potent means of getting four adults to their destination — a Panamera Turbo.</p>
<p>Some people find the Panamera’s looks quite challenging, but its certainly a more subtle looking car in this shade of black. Its long hood leads into a substantial glasshouse, finished with a heavily sloping rear end. Strong shoulder lines give it plenty of presence, while chrome touches adds a layer of sophistication to this luxury car.</p>

<p>The interior is an interesting blend of modern Porsche and old-school dark wood trim — not a typical specification for a Turbo. Each of the four passengers in this car receives a bolstered leather sports seat design to hold you in place when the driving becomes spirited. An interesting design feature is the console that leads from the dashboard all the way through to the rear quarters, dividing the back seats. Another practical point of the Panamera is its large hatchback opening and substantial trunk.</p>

<p>But what makes the Panamera really special is that it combines all of the above practicality with serious supercar performance. A 4.8-liter V8 engine is boosted by a pair of turbochargers for an output of over 500hp and a Tarmac torturing 516lf ft of torque. An advanced all-wheel drive system deploys this performance at an alarming rate, with 0-60mph completed in around 4 seconds and then going on to a top speed of 188mph.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a high-performance car, but also need to keep the family happy, the Panamera is a good choice. This 39,000-mile example is listed at $58,995 and appears to have been treated with great care throughout.</p>
