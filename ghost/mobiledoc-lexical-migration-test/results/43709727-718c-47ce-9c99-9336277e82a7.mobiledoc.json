All first year GTOs were powered by a 389 cubic-inch V8, and this one is equipped with its original engine with a four-barrel carburetor and a 325 horsepower output. This GTO was equipped with a three-speed automatic transmission and factory air conditioning, although the the A/C compressor is missing from this car."

This '64 GTO looks great with its triple-black color scheme and mag wheels, and all of the original chrome and badging is in great shape. Whether you're looking for a cruiser or a restoration candidate, this 1964 Pontiac GTO convertible is a perfect choice that will be fun either way."
