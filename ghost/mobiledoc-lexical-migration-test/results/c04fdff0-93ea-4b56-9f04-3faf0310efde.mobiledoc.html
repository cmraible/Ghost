<hr>
<p>The old saying is you can outrun the cops but you can’t outrun a Motorola. Well, these days police have more advanced technologies at their disposal, thanks to devices like plate scanners, so even if you get away in a chase you’ll always be looking over your shoulder. We don’t think a Ford Mustang GT driver in Arkansas was thinking clearly about this fact when he took off from an Arkansas State Police trooper who had pulled him over.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the latest Motorious Podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaKBrGIpgVc">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As captured on dashcam, Trooper Rand Lace starts following the pony car for a few moments, likely calling in the tags, then activates his lights and pulls the guy over. Everything seems to be going smoothly as the driver hands over his license and such after the trooper explains his reason for initiating the stop.</p>
<p>Then things go sideways when the trooper returns to declare the man has warrants for his arrest, ordering him to step out of the vehicle. Rather than surrender on the spot, the suspect decides he’d rather have his freedom even if he has to live on the lam. This wasn’t the smart choice, but the man had the right vehicle for the job.</p>

<p>Punching his S550 Mustang GT, the suspect easily takes the trooper to Gapplebees. We have to hand it to this guy, he doesn’t wreck out but seems to know his car quite well, smoothly slipping away into the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the only problem here is this guy isn’t going to get away with what he did. With video evidence on top of the fact the trooper confirmed the driver’s identity plus the fact he already has warrants, this suspect is going to be constantly looking over his shoulder until one day he slips up and he’s finally arrested. It’s better to just face the consequences of your actions in life instead of just delaying the because they tend to grow and become worse.</p>
