Most hearse heads are separated into two categories: restorers and traditionalists. The restorers do exactly what they sound like they do, but the traditionalists have the ultimate challenge before them. This special breed seeks out old hearses and rather than completely restore them, they just slap some tires on it and drive it until it falls apart. Chris Diganci is a self proclaimed hearse lover, he felt that the traditionalist aspect needed a little more representation. So he took his prized 1972 Cadillac Miller-Meteor hearse, changed the tires, added some preventative maintenance, and hit the road.",

He called a friend who ordered a new pump from a shop nearby, and the problem was solved the next day. After using close to 315 gallons of gas the couple made their way back home. As many problems as the car ran into along the way, the owner still seems to love what he does. It would appear that a cross country road trip in an old hearse is to die for.",
