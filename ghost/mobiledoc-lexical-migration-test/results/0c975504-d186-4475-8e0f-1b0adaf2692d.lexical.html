<p>November 2nd is my 45th birthday, which means I am entering what is statistically the <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/scientists-just-discovered-mid-life-crisis-peaks-at-age-47-heres-how-to-minimize-effect-of-happiness-curve.html">least happy phase of life</a> in the middle of a pandemic — and on the eve of the most important election in recent American history. So to celebrate, I’ll be breaking out the whiskey to kick off the first official DAILY POSTER LIVE CHAT. Our special guests are journalist and fellow <a href="https://theithacan.org/news/park-center-for-independent-media-awards-seventh-annual-izzy-award/">Izzy Award winner Naomi Klein</a> as well as Bernie 2020 pollster Ben Tulchin.</p>
<p><strong>Mark your calendar: The event will take place from 5:45pm-7:00pm ET (3:45pm-5pm Denver time) on November 2nd.</strong></p>

<p>Rock the boat,</p>
