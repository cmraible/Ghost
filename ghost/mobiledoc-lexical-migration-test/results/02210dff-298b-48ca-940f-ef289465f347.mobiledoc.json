For some weird reason, the Kia Stinger and Toyota Camry just aren’t getting the Aussies’ blood pumping. This has been driving up the values of everything from classic to some of the last examples of Australian muscle cars and utes, leaving us to wonder if Australian muscle might re-emerge at a later date due to popular demand."

After all, some great muscle cars came from the island back in the day, so it’s not too difficult to understand why enthusiasts there get misty-eyed when thinking about them, shortly before emptying their life savings to buy one."
