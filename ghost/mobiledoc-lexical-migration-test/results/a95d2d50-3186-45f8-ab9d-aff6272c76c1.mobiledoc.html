<p>Taylor Lorenz, on of the better writers on internet culture out there, has published an interview she and Alex Hawgood did with the owner of an account called @GaysOverCovid, which shames people in the gay community who are breaking COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>This struck me as an interesting insight:</p>
<blockquote>"The crazy thing is was we only had 8,000 to 10,000 followers, but the views we were getting on a story were 35,000 to 40,000," Gays Over Covid said. "That told me people didn't want to follow the account because they didn't want to be associated with it or look like they were supporting it. But they would peek at the stories."</blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, one of the problems with very public following mechanisms. There's a while bunch of social psychology around public shaming to unpick in this interview. </p>
