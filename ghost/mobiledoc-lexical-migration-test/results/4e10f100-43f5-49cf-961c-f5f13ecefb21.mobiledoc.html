The model has quite the run with 11 distinct generations, but it was the early part of the model run of the Thunderbird that people still think of with love and collectors tend to scoop up. Was this because the television commercials were so good? Maybe, maybe not, but watching them sure does give us the warm and fuzzies. Here are a few vintage Ford Thunderbird commercials that will send you back to a simpler time.</p>
