According to the auction house, this will be the largest online car auction of its kind ever held. Over 200 classic and collector cars will cross the block, like a 2014 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black Series and a 2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, so it should be a good one to watch from the comfort of your house."
