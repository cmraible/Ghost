It’s a sad time to see such a legend put out to pasture and we’re sure people who were planning on throwing this into the perfect build are scrambling to get theirs before they’re gone."

Some thought the less-expensive alternative to the LS7 would be offered to consumers for at least a few more years, but that expectation has been subverted."

The crate engine became popular with builders since it provides loads of instant power throughout the rev range. Sure, there are smaller engines with forced induction which match or exceed the 505-horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque made by the LS7, but peak power figures aren’t everything."

It’s possible there will be no replacement as the offerings for V8 crate engines shrink. Sure, Chevy still offers quite an array of options, but one can’t help but wonder if we’ll see them slowly picked off and not replaced, like dinner guests in some mystery movie. Ultimately, it might be part of the push to get everyone on the electrification bandwagon, but we’ll just have to see how things play out."
