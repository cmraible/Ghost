There are plenty of news sources repeating what Ford CEO Jim Farley said a couple of weeks ago, that the shortage is waning and will be over by the beginning of next year. That talking point has been repeated by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger rained on that parade, declaring the chip shortage is going to last another two years."

Considering that for May of this year, US car sales were down 21 percent year-over-year, even though consumer demand is still strong, it would seem a recovery could very well be a long way off. New car prices are also continuing their upward trend, with many shoppers paying well over sticker."

Manufacturing facilities were scaled back or even shut down as many treated covid as a civilization-ending condition. When consumer demand for automobiles bounced back much sooner than many in the industry were expecting, the supply chain couldn’t handle the strain. That meant fewer new cars being made, the cost of old cars skyrocketing, and plenty more market weirdness."

The demand for chips in the automotive market is increasing steeply. That demand is on a collision course with the brutal reality that Russia’s military actions are throwing global supply chains into chaos, especially when it comes to neon."

          "Just how long the currently supply of neon gas will last is an item of great debate. Some think it’s already pretty much depleted. Others argue we have at least a few more months. But the production of neon typically happens at steel plants since it uses some of the same processes and technologies, so it isn’t a natural resource only found in Ukraine. After Russia invaded Crimea, some US steel plants adjusted their air separation so they could capture neon. Other countries began taking similar steps. Before those changes, Ukraine was responsible for about 70 percent of the global neon supply."

While that’s certainly possible, even as the world moves to pick up the slack in the neon supply, the Russian invasion poses other threats to the semiconductor industry. Russia has been a huge supplier of materials needed to produce chips, like palladium, nickel, and C4F6. Military conflict can absolutely throw global supply chains into disarray, especially when heavily industrialized nations are involved."

While he said the commercial end is doing just fine, with fewer individuals demanding chips he sees an opportunity to play catchup and hopefully cure some of the supply chain woes. However, there is a risk inflation could wreak havoc instead of becoming a positive for the chip shortage situation."
