After all, if someone shoves an old car in a barn, garage, basement, or wherever else and piles junk all around it, once they die and the car is discovered it’s like digging up gold. That’s especially true of the 12 cars featured in the video below."

It’s always curious when someone essentially buries a regular car, but when it’s a vehicle worth a considerable amount from the get-go, you have to ask why they wouldn’t take better care of it?"

Buy a cover, stabilize fluids, keep it somewhere dry, etc. Not everyone is mindful of these factors, showing that money does not buy sense, even though it can buy expensive cars which are subsequently ruined. What these 12 barn find cars sold for is almost unthinkable, certain ones even crossing into seven-digit territory."

Even if the cars are absolute classics and worth quite a bit, their condition doesn’t justify paying as much as you would for one in pristine condition, whether original or restored. Again, that seems obvious to most, but either some of the sellers don’t get it or they’re of the grifter variety."
