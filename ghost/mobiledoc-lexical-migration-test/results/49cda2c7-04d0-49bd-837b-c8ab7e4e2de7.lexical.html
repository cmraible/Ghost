<p>International car collectors usually hold some of the most incredible automobiles ever to hit the asphalt of Germany, Italy, and other European automotive tycoons. These vehicles mainly consist of manufacturer icons such as the Lamborghini Hurrican or Porsche 911. However, it is scarce to see a collection as incredible as this one with probably hundreds of vehicles. This is an astonishing feat of an automotive legend. Deemed "Germany's Hidden $40 million Car Collection," this insane group of vehicles holds some of the world's most valuable cars with price tags well over a million dollars. </p>

<p>Sitting on the front lines of this incredible collection is a row of beautiful German and Italian supercars, including two ridiculously rare Ferrar SF90 twins, of which only 500 units were made. To the left of these vehicles is a section dedicated solely to some beautiful black Mercedes Maybach, which all sport different body styles, including a van, sedan, and coupes. A stunning white Bently is proudly presented as it shows off its incredible aesthetic and attractive body design. The layout of this warehouse allows you to take a step into the future of supercar design as you discover some genuinely innovative vehicles such as the Lamborghini SVJ, which is regarded as one of the brand's most performance-based models ever to hit the race tracks of Italy.</p>
<p>Alongside some other Mercedes Maybachs is a low-key Rolls Royce which boasts an incredibly menacing and dark presence. One of the most incredible vehicles in the entire collection is a car currently covered by a cover. However, it appears to be a Bugatti Divo which is confirmed by the "Divo" lettering on the cover's exterior. This $5.4 million hypercar makes up about 13.5% of the value of this insane collection. This $40 million gathering of some of the world's most insane vehicles is a ridiculous inventory spanning a vast array of cars from around the world, and it is fantastic!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XdU_U7tI0gs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
