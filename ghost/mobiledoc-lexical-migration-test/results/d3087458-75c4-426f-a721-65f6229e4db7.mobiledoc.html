<p>In a new podcast, Sirota talks to ProPublica senior reporter Jesse Eisinger about his bombshell report on a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">recent leak of IRS data</a> showing how billionaires are able to accumulate vast wealth while paying little or nothing in taxes. Recent<a href="__GHOST_URL__/why-are-billionaires-presumed-innocent/"> analyses</a> have estimated that every year, the richest 1 percent are not paying between $174 billion and $250 billion of taxes they owe. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">documents leaked to ProPublica</a> illustrate how tax loopholes, preferences, and shelters allow moguls such as Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett to pay a lower effective tax rate than everyone else. Eisinger also reviews the<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank"> story</a> of how right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel used low stock valuations and a Roth IRA —- which was designed for middle-class Americans — to shelter roughly $5 billion of wealth. The discussion concludes with a review of new legislative proposals to rebuild the IRS so that the agency can better police billionaire tax avoidance.</p>
