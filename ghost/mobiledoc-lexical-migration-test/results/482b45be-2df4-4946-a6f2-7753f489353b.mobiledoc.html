<p>There are a lot of expensive items in Monster Boy and the Cursed King, like Gold weapons and armor costing 1000 gold a pop! So, we’re going to need to farm gold coins!</p>
<p>After many hours of playing this game, we have uncovered the easiest way to farm gold coins, and it wasn’t even very well hidden, you literally come across it in the main story.</p>
<p>So, we’re going to want to be in this frame (you can easily get here by teleporting to the Village of Aeria and flying left)…</p>

<p>Here, we want to head to the far left as the lion and ground-pound through the blocks (make sure that you don’t attack and kill the bat because he’ll drop a health elixer… and we don’t want that).</p>

<p>As you fall down, each block with gold in it is actually worth a single gold piece. That may not sound like much at first, but they definitely add up very quickly!</p>

<p>I like to stick to the left for most of the ride down, but you can try to get as much as you can to make it more fun.</p>

<p>Once you go through a row completely filled with gold blocks, you only have three more rows that you want to stick to the left for until you want to make for the middle. Because once you get up to the last row, the gold blocks are in the shape of a sword facing downwards, so you want to be in the middle for all of that!</p>

<p>Now here’s the sneaky part! Once you get to the bottom, you’ll land on a platform that will float along the lava. Simply jump off of that into the lava. Once your health goes down to zero, you will respawn where you last saved, which just happens to be back at the top of the blocks.</p>

<p>So now you can repeat the process and watch that gold pour in! If done well, you can get 250 gold each time you go through!</p>
