The problem is that it is virtually impossible to find a reasonably priced well-running example of these cars. With this Porsche 911SC, you get a beautifully crafted vehicle with an astonishing slant-nose body kit, rear spoiler, and vents. To top all of that the bidding for this car, up until this point, has been relatively low. That makes this car a rare example of an amazing car at a reasonably low price. "
