<p>I have nearly two decades of history advocating for news organisations taking advantage of publishing on social platforms under my belt. Sure, I had and have misgivings about Facebook, but the general thrust of my work has always been that we need to be where the people are, and figure out what to do with the relationships we build there.</p>
<p>So, it’s really strange to find myself now cautioning about investing too much time and effort on TikTok because its future outside China is looking distinctly rocky right now. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this over the last couple of months, and here’s how I recommend <em>you</em> think about the situation:</p>

<h2 id="we%E2%80%99re-nowhere-near-peak-subscriptions-yet">We’re nowhere near peak subscriptions yet</h2>
<p>I do wonder about the journalism business’s obsession with “peak”. We keep talking about “peak podcasts” or “peak newsletters”, but did we ever talk about “peak magazines”?</p>
<p>Anyway, friend of the blog, the ever-insightful Greg Piechota, researcher-in-residence at INMA, has been looking at subscription levels in news, and his thesis is that we’re a long way off “peak subscription” yet. Sure, this will be a challenging few years for subs businesses, but there’s still plenty of headroom for growth.</p>

<p>Hey, you know that really useful function of Tweetdeck, where you can build a column of tweets by location, which is great for live news coverage and verification work?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s broken. Or, at least, suddenly a lot less accurate.</p>
