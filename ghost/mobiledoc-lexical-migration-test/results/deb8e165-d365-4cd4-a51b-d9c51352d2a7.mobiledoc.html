<p>What a diverse market the collector car industry represents. Every week, the Motorious editorial staff does a dive into the classified section of the site to find the cars for sale that we would want to buy for ourselves. These cars are more than worthy of a new garage, and we're thrilled to be able to share our picks with the readers each week. Here is a list of cars to check out as February rolls on.</p>

<p>Pontiac, and GM overall, had several big cars in the 1960s, and the Catalinas were an interesting car in the mix - while these cars were considered to be lower down the line than the Bonnevilles, they carry a lot of the same options, including powertrains. This particular 1966 Pontiac from Carlisle's Lakeland Winter Collection is a rare 2+2 that proves that the Bonneville was hardly an inferior cousin in the B-Body lineup from GM.</p>

<p>The classic car community has many incredible facets that make the art of vintage performance vehicle collecting an intricate and tasteful experience. Many of the older cars are in various states of disarray upon discovery. The car enthusiast's job is to restore and maintain the vehicle's legacy through their hard work. Many people have differing opinions on whether a classic should be modified past its original design, but the truth is that the insane muscle cars of the 1960s and 1970s were meant for one thing, performance. In recent years, the sudden realization of this fact has sprouted a movement of restomodders and power-hungry classic car enthusiasts ready to compete with some of the craziest cars from the modern muscle car era. Of course, this particular car is the perfect example to show you just how amazing one of these projects can be, and the best part is that you could soon own it!</p>

<p>With a massive 454-cid monster of an engine under the hood, the LS6 Chevelle essentially threw the last punch in the muscle car fight. Although small brawls continued throughout the decade, none could come close to Chevy’s ultimate muscle car. Making 450-horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque, the 454-cid LS6 engine was equipped with 4-bolt mains, and an 11.25:1 compression ratio.</p>

<p>The General Lee is a big name within the classic Mopar muscle car community because of the “Dukes Of Hazzard” TV show that swept across the nation and quickly cemented itself as an icon in American car culture. The sight of the vintage Orange paint scraping up against trees, dirt, and tall grass as the Duke brothers ran from the cops is one that brought a smile to everyone’s face in the 1970s. However, most of the cars were demolished during the shooting of the show, which means that anyone with the dream of owning a General Lee of their own would be out of luck. Luckily we have a few particular automotive enthusiasts in the classic car community who are willing to put in the work to recreate one of those classic beasts. This car is a perfect example of that dedication!</p>

<p>McLaren is possibly one of the most outstanding supercar manufacturers to ever hit the European sports car market for their incredible performance, style, and engineering. With the full force of a track-bred design team under its belt, the Mclaren brand has risen to heights that other companies could never imagine in just 59 years. The sound pouring out of the exhaust pipes of the McLaren racing vehicles is purely musical as it has been designed for function, which has led to an intense form. But, of course, these cars don't come cheap as they mainly were constricted to a limited number of vehicles per production model. So how are those car enthusiasts, with a little extra cash to spare, supposed to find one of these incredible masterpieces of automotive innovation?</p>

<p>Porsche has made a big name for itself over the last 90 years for producing some of the world's fastest German sports cars ever to hit the European sales floor. These tiny vehicles boasted potent yet small, four-cylinder engines whose reputation for speed made the cars the perfect choice for any hot-blooded driver ready for some action. But, of course, to drive one of these cars, you had to be prepared for the ride of your lifetime, and that came in the form of a short wheelbase, lightweight body, and your choice of coupe or roadster body types. This particular vehicle was an iconic car for its day because of the sleek Porsche style that still stands out to this day. So what car is so incredible that it deserves the title of the best Porsche representative from the mid-1960s?</p>
