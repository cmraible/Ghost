Sure, some are obviously staged, but there are still plenty of cool cars tucked away in barns, sheds, garages, or other places where few people know about them. Today, we get a look at an epic 39-car barn find consisting of some of the most desirable Chevy muscle cars ever made."

Some are rough and others look like they’ve been at least mostly restored. These amazing classics have been tucked away at a working farm in Oklahoma, taking up 5 different buildings on the property."

As we’ve seen plenty of times, there are wanna-be barn find hunters who don’t understand trespassing laws and certainly don’t respect people’s private property as they quest to become rich and famous. However, you can tell from the beginning of the video wherever the farm is, it’s a pretty remote area, so it’s probably not a place you would just happen upon while traveling from one city to the next."

The guy who discovered this stash has an excellent reputation for being a Chevy authority, so that helps tremendously. After all, people who have squirreled away cars for decades understandably want them to go to someone who will appreciate and respect what they are."

Someone who has hidden away some beloved rides for decades isn’t going to hand them over just because you can work on anything. You’ll need to gain their confidence, show you’re a professional, and be keenly aware of the delicate emotions attached to the classic cars."
