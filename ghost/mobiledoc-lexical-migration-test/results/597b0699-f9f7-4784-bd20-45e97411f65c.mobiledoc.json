        "markdown": "* If you plan on buying a Sleep Number mattress, you also need to buy the bed frame/base (that's what allows you to position yourself in zero gravity, etc). It really makes absolutely no sense to just buy the mattress. It would be like buying a Ferrari without wheels. \n* If you buy a Sleep Number flextop king mattress (like we did), you will need to buy special sheets. Sleep Number sells flextop sheets, but you can also find them for [less money on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2CeW5N3). \n* Sleep Number sheets need to be washed a few times before they feel super soft and comfortable. I'd recommend 2-3 washes before use.\n* If you have any pets you **should always be aware** of where they are *before* adjusting the bed to the flat position. This is because they can potentially get trapped and crushed if they're under the bed when you are adjusting it. So for everyone's sake, please take a second and do a quick head count.\n* These beds are expensive, Sleep Number offers great no interest financing (in our case for 48 months) through a Synchrony bank credit card. Just make sure you pay off the minimum amount due each month and you'll be golden. "

I found the Zero G setting to be extremely comfortable for watching TV while laying on your back, however, the second you want to roll to your side--it's not as comfy.

It didn't work well on the auto setting--and really, what other setting would you leave it on? We quickly noticed the lights would flick on depending on how we moved in the bed so that little experiment ended rather fast. When it comes to the privacy mode, the only reason I'd recommend enabling it is if you're completely privacy paranoid and don't like hosting any of your data in the cloud. Otherwise, you should keep privacy mode turned off as enabling it will result in none of your sleep data being collected. "

However, as I mentioned, Sleep Number offers interest free financing often for up to 48 months which means that we're only paying around $150 per month for the bed. That, I can live with. If you can qualify for the interest free financing I would absolutely recommend taking advantage of it. It's like free money. "

Plus, when you think about the core feature of a Sleep Number bed (the ability to adjust the firmness) I'd imagine as you age your mattress needs will change too – with a Sleep Number bed you can simply adjust your Sleep Number setting without having to buy an entire new mattress. Something to consider for sure. "
