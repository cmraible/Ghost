According to Sean, from Autotopia LA, this can run you anywhere from $10,000 for a rough condition classic to upwards of $100,000 for a high-end example. While it makes sense for most enthusiasts to spend a bit more for the higher quality, most, if not all, of the original parts will likely be replaced in favor of modern alternatives, so it may be better to find a cheaper model for the project."

While this seems borderline ridiculous for some renderings, these designs will be an essential part of the entire endeavor as they essentially determine the final product."

While some builders opt to use the factory chassis and frame, most will advise a fully customized chassis to fit your ideas surrounding performance. Speaking of performance, the engine is a massive part of the car, which requires a lot of attention from engineers and designers alike. Unless you go for a stripped-down junkyard LS from a long-forgotten Chevy truck, the powerhouse is going to cost anywhere from $2K-$3K to upwards of $30,000."
