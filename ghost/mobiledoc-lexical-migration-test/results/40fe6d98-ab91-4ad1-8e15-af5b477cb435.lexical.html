<div class="flickr-frame"></div> I set out for home at around 6.30pm, fully expecting the streets to be thronged with people walking home. I was wrong.<p></p>
<p>The staggered departure from London, with many people heading home from 4pm onwards seemed to have take the pressure off, and the streets were busy without being packed. As I approached London Bridge station, it was getting positively quiet.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Transport For London for getting the buses and trains running again so quickly.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
