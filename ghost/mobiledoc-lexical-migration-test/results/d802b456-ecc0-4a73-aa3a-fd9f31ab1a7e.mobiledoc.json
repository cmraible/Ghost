If you’re not a fan, maybe you’re wondering what all the hubbub is about. Well, the car is a real classic, a British beauty, so naturally Hammond screwed it up and had to pay people to fix it."

He also seems to lack some sense because the man was so excited about the classic Jaguar looking so great, he took it on a vacation to France even though it mechanically wasn’t completely sorted."
