Some fans probably remember his collaboration with Chrysler in the 1980s, too.</p>

<p>When Shelby decided to take another swing at making his own sports car in the 1990s, he didn't opt for Ford or Mopar power, though. Instead, he built the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0017-1999-shelby-series-1/820676#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Shelby Series 1</a> with a worked-over version of the Oldsmobile Aurora V8, as well as numerous interior components raided from the GM parts bin.</p>
<p>The Series I was the first and only car designed from the ground up by Carroll Shelby. The tuned Aurora V8 produced 320 horsepower and 290 lb/ft of torque from just 4.0 liters. This was enough to propel the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0017-1999-shelby-series-1/820676#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Shelby Series 1</a> from zero to 60 in a scant 4.4 seconds, with quarter mile times in the high 12 second range.</p>

<p>This was heady stuff for the late '90s, and all 249 production examples found happy homes as soon as they were built. In fact, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0017-1999-shelby-series-1/820676#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this car</a>, #238, was ordered before production had even started. That's quite a vote of confidence, but Shelby's proven track record likely made it an easy choice.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0017-1999-shelby-series-1/820676#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">just 249 examples built</a>, it actually stands as one of Carroll Shelby's rarest creations. In the early 2000s, there were plans for an updated Series 2 car, which would have included more power and a minor restyling effort.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, more stringent federal regulations meant that the Seris 2 project was dead in the water. <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0017-1999-shelby-series-1/820676#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The Series 1</a> remains Carroll Shelby's only design not based on an existing production car.</p>

<p>Incredibly, this Shelby Series 1 has covered just 2,679 since it was built. It's spent is entire life as part of the prestigious <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0017-1999-shelby-series-1/820676#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Elkhart Collection</a>, which is heading to auction on October 23 and 24 through RM Sotheby's.</p>
