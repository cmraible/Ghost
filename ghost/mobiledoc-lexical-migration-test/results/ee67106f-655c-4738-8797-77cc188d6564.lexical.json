Under the hood you’ll find an engine specifically modified for the racing track with a velocity stack. Back in the day, the owner of this car used to really tear it up around the local test and tune events. This is, oddly enough, something that viewers of the mini documentary were sort of upset to hear. Maybe it has something to do with its current condition but that could have been avoided with proper maintenance.",
