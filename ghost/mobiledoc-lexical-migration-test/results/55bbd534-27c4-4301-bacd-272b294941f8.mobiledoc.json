You can actually find a decent number of Cherokees (and Wranglers) with a right-hand drive configuration in the U.S., but where this JDM Cherokee stands out is its different taillights, darker front turn signals and side marker lights on the front fenders. Other than the export market lights, this Cherokee is no different than your typical XJ, and that includes the 4.0-liter inline-six engine and legendary four-wheel drive system."

With its low mileage, this 1994 Jeep Cherokee would be perfect to take to a '90s-era car show, and its and JDM origins would even let you take this to an import car show! Or you could just drive it as is... although you might have to update the info for the Panasonic in-car navigation system."
