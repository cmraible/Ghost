<p>Simon Owens’ reason for <a href="https://medium.com/marketing-102/why-every-blog-post-should-be-crossposted-to-linkedin-and-medium-659be418ebe9">cross-posting to his blog, Medium and LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The harsh reality is that only a tiny fraction of your social media followers will click on a link to an outside website, and most prefer to interact and consume content that’s native to the platform they’re browsing. So if you’re only publishing, at most, a few articles per week and don’t have an enormous social following, chances are your content is getting lost in the noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a new reality we’re living in that’s going to make it ever harder to build destination sites. What’s becoming important is finding ways to expose your ideas to a wider audience, and that now means, inevitably, working with other platforms to spread your writing and content.</p>
<p>I suspect that people working in video are well ahead of those of us who are more text-centric here. Do you know anyone working in video who isn’t uploading to Vimeo, YouTube or Vine?</p>

<p>We’ve talked for a long time about sites having “fuzzy” boundaries – that content diffuses beyond the “wall” of the website – but now we’re seeing that spreading further. I’m fascinated by the way <a href="http://euansemple.com/theobvious/">Euan Semple</a> cross-posts everything he writes to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+EuanSemple/posts">Google+</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/euan.semple">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/1701?trk=prof-sm">LinkedIn</a> and his own blog. He’s <em>clearly</em> more interested in sharing his ideas than building website <em>per se</em>.</p>
<p>And that’s a difficult idea for those of us from a publication background to adjust to.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
