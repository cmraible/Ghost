As a callout to the famous “Paint Chip” Barracuda, Dodge will be offering a multi-color wrap option for any current-gen Challenger. We guess the rainbow in Dodgeland tastes like tire smoke."

However, you’ll need to shell out for the installation at a shop certified by 3M. In other words, this will be a pretty pricey option, so it’ll be interesting to see how many people pony up for it and for which models."

If you really stop and think about it, there’s got to be a reason for the brand blowing its wad like this, almost as if they know what’s coming down the pipeline won’t work with any kind of nostalgic callouts or something. I really hope I’m dead wrong but have a bad feeling I’m not."
