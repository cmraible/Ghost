<p>Stanley and Gene Simmons formed Kiss in 1973 along with Peter Criss and Ace Frehley. The band is known for their outrageous costumes and makeup with each rocker having his own on-stage persona, and like the band's costume designs, Stanley's 2020 Chevrolet Corvette is rocking a similar black and white paint job. In fact, all that's missing to transform this C8 into Stanley's "Starchild" persona is a star painted over the right headlight!</p>
<p>In his Facebook post, Stanley doesn't seem to be too big of a fan of American cars in the past saying "For years the auto industry said 'Buy American.' I said 'When you manufacture world class cars I'll buy them.'" The good news is that he sounds pretty enamored with the C8 so far. </p>
<blockquote>"For me the 2020 Corvette C8 is beyond that. It raises the bar with cutting edge technology. It's a machine I'm proud to drive AND it's drop dead GORGEOUS. I LOVE mine!"</blockquote>
<p>This C8 is sporting an Arctic White paint job with optional black trident spoke wheels, and the interior is done up in Adrenaline Red with the sportier GT2 bucket seats. Without the Z51 performance package, this Corvette has the base 490 horsepower tune from the 6.2-liter LT2 V8.</p>
