From modern-day powerhouses such as the Silverado to the classic stallions of yesteryear which will forever live on in our hearts as some of the coolest trucks ever produced. Today's subject of discussion is an example of the latter. This is, of course, the Chevy C-10 pickup truck. Though they may not have the luxury or power we've come to expect in our modern trucks, these iconic vehicles have become famous in the automotive community for their classic styling and awesome engine options for their time.

Due to the truck’s widely accepted reputation as a great platform for a street truck build, the suspension has been lowered. This gives the truck a striking figure and an aggressive command over the street. Another aspect of this incredible truck is the updated rear sway bars and front tubular control arms. This gives the truck great handling and an amazing driving experience. "
