<p>FC Bayern <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/aubameyang-likes-exotic-supercars/">forward</a> Kingsley Coman got in trouble recently when he rolled up to the team’s training facility in his personal <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-isnt-just-another-mercedes-300sl/">Mercedes</a> G-Class. Per team rules, he and all over members of the German <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cristiano-ronaldo-bugatti-la-voiture-noire/">soccer team</a> (that’s football for everyone on the other side of the Atlantic) must drive an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/audi-abandons-combustion-engines/">Audi</a> to practices and games. Audi is a major sponsor for FC Bayern, so the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/porsche-reveals-secret-hypercars/">German automaker</a> wants everyone to see the players thoroughly enjoying its cars and no other rides.</p>

<p>Coman didn’t just roll up in any old Mercedes G-Wagen, but instead really made a statement with a G63 AMG. They’re like someone took a good off-roader, shoved a supercar engine in it, and the result is far more power than would be reasonable for something designed for low-speed, technical maneuvering on a trail. It’s an ego vehicle in every sense, so Coman was probably sending a loud and clear message.</p>

<p>This isn’t Coman’s first incident with driving the wrong car to an FC Bayern function. About a year ago he rolled up to the Sabener Strasse complex behind the wheel of a McLaren 570S Spider, incurring a hefty fine for the offense. What can you say, the man is a rebel and has good taste in cars, yet he’s persecuted for that.</p>
<p>After the previous incident, Coman claimed his supplied Audi had a broken side mirror and so was in the shop for the repair, making it necessary to drive his McLaren instead.</p>
<p>If it isn’t already obvious, Coman reportedly isn’t really happy playing forward for RC Bayern. He supposedly will be looking for a new soccer club during the off-season, so the man likely is tired of the silly car rule and other club policies.</p>
