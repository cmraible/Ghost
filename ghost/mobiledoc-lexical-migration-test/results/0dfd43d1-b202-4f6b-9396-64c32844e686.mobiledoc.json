The distinctive design from the house of Bertone is still a striking thing to look at today. DNA that went on to serve future BMW’s can be clearly seen in this model with its notable kidney grilles. Its sharp-edged silhouette made for a contrast amongst some of the more curvaceous models on display at the prestigious event."

An intriguing  feature of the concept car’s cabin is a large passenger vanity mirror that sits up write from a jewellery box-styled glove compartment. Vertical controls and a large thin-rimmed steering wheel completes this blast from the past."
