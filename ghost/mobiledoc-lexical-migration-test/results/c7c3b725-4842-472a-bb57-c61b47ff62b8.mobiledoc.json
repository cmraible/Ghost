          ", while simple, is incorporated very well. The notes are placed in a circle, with the melody showing you the timing of when to hit them; if you make a mistake, the melody will repeat and if you make enough mistakes, a light will travel along with the circle to assist with the timing. Don’t be afraid of missing notes though; the music is performed in such a way that even if you have to repeat a section one hundred times, it still flows naturally with the song. For those of you who strive to perfect rhythm games (while I won't spoil it), there is something for you at the end of the game if you perfect every chapter."
