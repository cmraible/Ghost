<p>The only concern you should have is which car you want to win. First off, there's <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a brand new 2020 Corvette</a> in Elkhart Lake Blue Metallic, in 3LZ trim.</p>
<p>This one has <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">all the right options</a>. It comes with the Z51 Performance Package and the Engine Appearance Package. There's carbon fiber detailing everywhere to set off that beautiful blue paint, with the factory staggered wheels finished in Carbon Flash as the perfect accent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This Corvette</a> hasn't even been built yet. If you win, you're going to be the first owner, and likely the first person to ever drive it. How cool is that?</p>

<p>There's one thing that might be even cooler, depending on your preference. This <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">beautifully restored 1966 Corvette coupe</a> has been carefully restored to award-winning condition, and it's a compelling alternative to the new Corvette.</p>
<p>Finished in Rally Red, <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Corvette</a> has its numbers matching 427 cubic inch V8 under the hood. That powerful big block makes 390 horsepower and an impressive 460 lb/ft of torque.</p>
