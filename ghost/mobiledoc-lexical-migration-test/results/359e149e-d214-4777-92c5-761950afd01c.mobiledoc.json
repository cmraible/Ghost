Owners will input the 4-digit code on the infotainment touchscreen, not through a connected smartphone. The automaker declined to disclose anything about what kind of encryption the technology uses, saying it's \"proprietary information.\" And while the company says it will be notifying vehicle owners directly, it encourages anyone who believes their vehicle qualifies for the upgrade to reach out to their local dealership to confirm that. We'll know soon enough how well this move works. "
