          "We’ve been told repeatedly electric is the future of the automotive market, but as we’ve suspected for years, that future doesn’t involve large swaths of the industry. That suspicion has seemingly been confirmed by a new report claiming Ford is preparing to slash 8,000 jobs so it can pursue future electric vehicle plans. Bloomberg claims layoffs of both salaried and hourly employees will be announced in the next few weeks."

That was created to manage internal combustion engine operations, casting serious doubt on whether Ford will continue manufacturing ICE vehicles in the near future. Executives have talked extensively about reshaping the entire company under the Ford+ plan, which they feel will increase value to consumers and deepen brand loyalty."

          "Like Elon Musk, Ford CEO Jim Farley has said recently that the automaker has “too many people” onboard and needs to lighten the load some. Musk has justified layoffs because of an impeding recession, but there’s no indication Farley will do the same. It will be telling if automakers which haven’t been enthusiastic about full electrification shed many employees in the coming months."
