<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Happy New Year and welcome to 2022 — the year that could be the beginning of the end of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/democrats-fdr-new-deal-financial-crisis-1248615/">what’s left of American democracy</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/does-not-present-sufficient-cause/">the planet’s livable ecosystem</a>, unless things fundamentally change.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em>’s regular publishing schedule starts back up tomorrow, but I just wanted to remind you about our first big live event of the year on Wednesday, January 5, with Academy Award-winning director Adam McKay, about the film <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81252357"><em>Don’t Look Up</em></a> (which I co-produced). The film is a climate allegory that instantly became the most popular movie on the world’s largest streaming platform.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/1-5-live-chat/"><strong>Details about the live event are here</strong></a><strong> — it is exclusive for our paying subscribers (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/subscribe/"><strong>click here to become one if you aren’t already</strong></a>). Make sure to watch the movie before the event, and consider reading <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2022/01/adam-mckay-dont-look-up-climate-change-review"><strong>this insightful article</strong></a> about the film.</strong></p>
<p>I spent New Years Eve <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1477148915568836612?s=20">playing board games with the family</a> and reading all of our subscribers’ end-of-the-year feedback <strong>—</strong> thank you so much for sending us such thoughtful input about the coming year, and for the kind words about <em>Don’t Look Up.</em></p>
<p>If you’ve watched the film, you know the movie’s fictional TV show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjUPjJdiD_o"><em>The Daily Rip</em></a> is a proxy for how corporate media has become one of the big obstacles to addressing the crises bearing down on our world.</p>
<p>As we head into the new year, <em>The Daily Poster</em> will keep trying to be part of fixing that problem. At a moment when the ruling party seems barely interested in delivering on its promises and right-wing authoritarians are threatening to take over the government, we will do the opposite of what corporate media typically does: We will continue following the money, holding politicians accountable, and focusing on the emergencies that imperil humanity.</p>
<p>We will do that because we know that when it comes to journalism, corporate media will never be part of the solution — a more robust, independent reader-supported media is the only way forward.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our team as we head into the new year and expand our work. We will have more news on that expansion soon — until then, I hope to see you on January 5!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
