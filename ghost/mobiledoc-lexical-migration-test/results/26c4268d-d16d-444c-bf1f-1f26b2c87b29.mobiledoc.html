<p>Our politics tends to lead us to focus on specific causes, but there are a few issues — call them super-issues — that are related to all the others. Campaign finance, for instance, is a super-issue that determines outcomes across nearly every policy debate. Likewise, democracy and voting rights determines who gets elected, which then determines what policies have a chance of passing.</p>
<p>But one of those super-issues gets a lot less attention, even though it too is shaping our world: monopoly power.</p>
<p>It seems no matter where you look these days, there is a corporate monopoly using its power to change our world, and most often for the worse. And yet even though our nation has a rich and vibrant history of anti-monopoly movements, this entire super-issue of monopoly has not been an explicit, organized mass-movement cause for decades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that is starting to change because of people like Zephyr Teachout, the law professor, political icon and antitrust expert. Thanks to her work — and the work of others like the American Economic Liberties Project — fighting monopoly power is once again starting to become a serious political cause, to the point where Congress on Wednesday will hold antitrust-focused <a href="https://twitter.com/zephyrteachout/status/1287736473916186625?s=21">hearings</a> with the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>To really understand what’s at stake, I asked Zephyr to provide TMI readers an exclusive excerpt of her terrific new book called <a href="https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781250200891">Break 'Em Up: Recovering Our Freedom from Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money</a>. I encourage you to read it here, buy her book -- and get involved in this fight.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-the-tools"><strong>We Have the Tools</strong></h3>
<p>By Zephyr Teachout</p>
<p>Today’s progressive populism traces back to September 2008, when the banks crashed the world economy and were bailed out. All the major institutions—Congress, statehouses, universities, think tanks—acted like nothing major had changed and went on talking about policy and arguing about solutions just as they had during the prior generation.</p>
<p>The complete inability of mainline institutions to deal with the crash in a serious, honest, and equitable way gave rise to new institutions, new ideas, new, unafraid communities—the Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter, the Sunrise Movement, the Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign. Out of those movements, ideas that were once considered ludicrous began to be taken seriously: the Green New Deal, Democratic Socialism, universal healthcare, the student debt jubilee, reparations, universal voting.</p>
<p>This fierce new activism has enjoyed some startling successes. However, when it comes to divestiture (the technical term for breaking up a company), there has not been one single, notable, in-the-street protest targeted at fracturing one of the giants.</p>
<p>We are in the early stages of a major battle to reinvigorate the anti-monopoly movement. There are huge toolboxes of existing laws that can be enforced right now; a lot of bad Supreme Court precedents that can be overturned by Congress; and new laws that will need to be passed to address weaknesses in the old laws and new obstacles.</p>
<p>The new antitrust era, to meet the crisis of concentration we now face, will require us to do all three.</p>
<p>First, we can start by demanding that the federal government and states enforce the laws already on the books and demanding executive leadership. Under existing law, past mergers between WhatsApp and Facebook and Instagram, and Bayer and Monsanto, could have and should have been stopped, and can be unwound. The predatory actions and other unfair business practices of Uber and Amazon and Google can be investigated.</p>
<p>Some of this is already happening: attorneys general are investigating big tech and opioid manufacturers, and have sued to stop the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. But we’ll need more resources for state attorneys general, and far more action on the federal level.</p>
<p>There are also countless opportunities for federal regulators, and for states whose laws mirror federal law, to pursue those remedies already mentioned and hundreds of other cases. For this to happen, antitrust enforcers must be ready to seek significant structural remedies, instead of simply agreeing to company concessions. But under existing law—and with the political will—the great breakup could begin. A major <strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/supreme-court-apple-decision-antitrust/">win against Apple</a></strong>in the Supreme Court last year created a huge opportunity for private antitrust cases.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission—right now—can also play a critical role in changing basic competition rules. As Sandeep Vaheesan argued in a <strong><a href="https://harvardlpr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2017/02/HLP110.pdf">significant article in 2017</a></strong>, the FTC has substantial power to define the scope of federal laws. Congress, anticipating changing business practices and changing methods of unfairness, purposefully gave the FTC the power to define “unfair methods of competition.”</p>
<p>Executive agencies have enormous discretion to act. The FTC can and should change merger law by making mergers presumptively illegal in competitive markets, and should lay out very particular clear, bright-line rules—like speed limits—against certain kinds of “vertical” behavior, like when Tyson forces farmers to use the building firms it prefers.</p>
<p>The next president, in particular, will have outsized power when it comes to antitrust; he can unilaterally promulgate new merger rules, directing the FTC to adopt clear guidelines that declare that it will oppose mergers of a certain size and percentage of the market. The new guidelines for the Department of Justice and the FTC can adopt the posture that policing conduct violations is a top priority. They can strongly signal that they won’t stand for a few small changes, but will require structural reorganization.</p>
<p>Even with strong enforcement, we need new laws. Congress should start by overturning all the <strong><a href="https://prospect.org/power/new-era-supreme-court/">bad decisions made by the Reagan judges</a></strong>. During the golden age of antitrust law, courts treated particular business practices as presumptively bad. As noted, since 1980, they have applied what is called the “rule of reason” to those same business practices and treated these unfair practices as unfair only if they hurt consumer prices.</p>
<p>While it sounds sensible, we have all seen the result: judges effectively created an impossible hurdle, a fact-intensive examination of any given conduct that determines only whether that conduct is good or bad for consumer prices. The result is too much discretion in the courts, high and uncertain hurdles to overcome for plaintiffs or prosecutors, and laws that exist in theory but not in practice.</p>
<p>For instance: Congress should pass a law restoring the 1960s approach toward tying contracts. Congress can likewise pass a law overturning bad precedent on predatory pricing and say that predatory behavior is per se illegal. States aren’t bound by congressional action. They can do the same thing.</p>
<p>But if we are honest about the scale of our predicament, we need to do more than get back to 1970s laws and enforcement levels. Mere return to the past is insufficient, for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, there were weaknesses in those laws. This time, they should have clearer bright-line rules, and not leave so much discretion to enforcers.</p>
<p>Second, the state of the economy now is different from what it was in 1981. It is now so concentrated that more radical action is required than even those laws allowed. Updated anti-merger laws, for instance, won’t help us unwind companies that have already merged.</p>
<p>Finally, we didn’t face the unique threats of big data and big tech.</p>
<p>To address our current threats, Congress and statehouses should pass new laws banning companies from becoming too large in absolute terms, in terms of their market, and in terms of the economy. We have done this before, in particular sectors. No depository institution, <strong><a href="https://ilsr.org/rule/market-share-caps/2137-2/">for instance</a></strong>, is allowed to be larger than 10% of the market. What if we applied that same rule to all industries: no more than 10% or you’re broken up?</p>
<p>We could supplement market-share rules with size rules; we could require divestiture—or significantly higher taxes—for any company that grows larger than a certain absolute size or GDP percentage size. Congress should also pass laws to break up companies by function. Glass-Steagall forced the separation of investment and depository institutions. The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/mail-contracts.htm#Public_Relations">1934 </a><strong><a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/mail-contracts.htm#Public_Relations">Air Mail Act</a></strong> broke off airlines from aircraft companies.</p>
<p>We can apply the logic of the Air Mail Act and Glass-Steagall to other industries. For instance, we can decide that a search company cannot also be an ad com- pany, or a store, or a map provider. A function-like divestiture rule would apply to companies over a certain size or domi- nance and likely be sector-specific.</p>
<p>These new laws would serve as bulwarks against self-dealing and unfair business models, against the temptations that occur when one entity owns two unrelated companies and may want to use power in one area to engage in unfair business practices in another.</p>
<p>Addressing the particular threats of big tech will require reshaping old principles. Even after the behemoths have been broken up into subsidiary parts, some functions of Facebook, Google, and Amazon may be best designated as public utilities and regulated as such. We should require neutrality for all platforms, and ban Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple from using the data gleaned from their marketplaces to compete against the companies that use their services. We should ban them from using targeted ads, or at least in the aspects of their business that have become essential to our ability to communicate with each other in the online public sphere.</p>
<p>With such a ban, some companies might become state-owned, like the post office or public library. Or they might become fee-based, like other essential infrastructure—water, transportation.</p>
<p>Facebook, for instance, and its rivals in social media (which it will have, once it is broken up) could choose to charge $1 a month. They could be <strong><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/from-private-bads-to-public-goods-adapting-public-utility-regulation-for-informational-infrastructure">funded by non-targeted ads</a></strong>—Google keywords, for instance, do not require surveillance to work, and are more than sufficient to provide Google with a profit.</p>
<p>Taking these steps would mean that Facebook and Google would no longer be competitors against the news organizations they serve, and local news would have an opportunity to recoup the losses of the last decade. Companies dependent on Amazon and Google would have a chance to compete against each other instead of serving Google and Amazon—and democracy would have a fighting chance again.</p>
<p>At the same time, we need to outlaw the arbitration regime and block common ownership by Wall Street, so that a few institutional investors don’t control huge swaths of the economy. We must repeal laws that make it hard for workers to organize in solidarity with each other, like the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which banned secondary strikes.</p>
<p>We need to pass publicly financed elections at all levels of government, either using the New York City model in which each small donation is amplified by public funds, or the Seattle model in which every voter gets a voucher they can use to support candidates for office, or—ideally—a combination of the two. We need to rewrite our corporate laws so that workers have a voice in decision making, and profit doesn’t drive everything.</p>
<p>This may seem overwhelming, but the truth is that we are already on our way toward a new anti-monopoly moment, and the biggest hurdle is not identifying solutions, but overcoming passivity. That is already happening.</p>
<p>When Democrats took over control of Congress in 2018, the Congressional Antitrust Subcommittee, led by David Cicilline of Rhode Island, started a major investigation and began holding hearings. Those hearings, in turn, seem to have helped spur state attorneys general around the country to begin their own investigations. Within a few months, a once-moribund area was suddenly lively.</p>
<p>Investigations may seem like weak sauce compared with actually breaking a company up, but action builds on itself, and creates its own energy. Federal investigations by Congress can spur the FTC; the FTC can spur states; major hearings can spur outrage; and outrage can lead to laws being changed. The key thing is that people get involved and antitrust returns to the center of politics.</p>
<p>Above all, we must remember a few basic anti-monopoly principles:</p>
<p>1. Open, competitive markets, working together with publicly provided services and neutral infrastructure, are necessary for economic liberty. There is no one-size- fits-all answer to every industry, but unregulated private monopoly poses a unique threat.</p>
<p>2. We should make it easier to organize people and harder to organize capital. It should be as easy to unionize, or to create a cooperative, as it is hard to merge goliaths.</p>
<p>3. It’s better to err on the side of decentralized private power. Democratic governance is messy and will lead to mistakes, but corporate government will lead to tyranny.</p>
