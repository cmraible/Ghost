          "Batman is a hero whose incredible feats of physical prowess, showmanship, and wealth have been cemented into the culture as the best a human can possibly be. Along with heart-wrenching stories, such as those found in the Nolan Batman series, viewers' eyes were caught with a plethora of gadgets and gizmos designed to take down the worst of criminals while still abiding by the "

Instead, we're going to focus on the great car that has carried the Bats in and out of so many ridiculous scenarios."

          "Let's talk specifically about the original Batmobile, but don't worry, it's not the obscure '39 Cadillac that accompanied the actual show. Instead, this was the first car to ever-present the flamboyant style that fit the crime fighter so well. Any of you Batman nerds out there will know this car quite well as the Adam West Batmobile. However, this car is a tribute to the original rather than one of the actual picture cars. That means that you could own this incredible Batman masterpiece for far less than one of the \"real\" Batmobiles with just as much style and recognizability."

          "This car started its life as a stunning 1979 Lincoln whose body was removed and re-sculpted to fit the exact specifications of the first episode's car. So, of course, this straight-bodied masterpiece is enormous, along with being so extravagant and boastful. That's precisely why it needs a powerful engine to help the heavy chassis drive at high speeds. Under the hood is a massive 400 ci V8 engine which puts out more than enough power to move this extra long masterpiece. This car is the perfect vehicle for any car enthusiast with a particular affection for the most iconic era of Batman."
