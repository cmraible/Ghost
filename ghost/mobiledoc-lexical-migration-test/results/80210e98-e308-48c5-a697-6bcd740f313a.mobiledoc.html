<p>I wouldn't normally start with a minor software update ‚Äî but Apple's release of iOS 14.5 last night isn't minor for publishers. Once you install the upgrade, your phone (or iPad) stops <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">advertisers from tracking you between apps</a> and websites by default:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/IMG_0078.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Apple's Do Not Track on the iPad" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/IMG_0078.jpeg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/IMG_0078.jpeg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/IMG_0078.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>You can go into that setting, switch it on, and you get asked, on per app basis, if you want to allow them to track your data, instead of blocking everything by default.</p>
<p>Here's Apple's own explanation of the change:</p>

<p>Whatever <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/331612538028890?id=428636648170202">Facebook says</a>, this could well be a good thing for publishers. If they've got a good data strategy already, if they've invested in building a useful, definable audience, and if they've built ways of reliably reaching those audiences ‚Äî they can now offer something many of the big ad networks will struggle to do. </p>
<p>Happy times ‚Äî if you're positioned to take advantage of the switch. </p>

<p>However, my opinion is clearly not universally shared. A group of German publishers is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a48d9aa-244b-4945-b2a0-01c68683544a">taking Apple to court over it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>A group of Germany‚Äôs largest media, tech and advertising companies have accused Apple of antitrust abuse as it introduces changes to the privacy settings of iPhones that they say will harm the ads market. Nine industry associations, representing companies including Facebook and Axel Springer, the owner of Bild, Die Welt and Insider, filed the complaint on Monday with Germany‚Äôs competition regulator.</blockquote>
<p>They're predicting a 60% decline in ad revenue from apps, and a need to app developers to switch to a paid model. </p>
<p>Which seems, well, OK‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>As Thomas put it:</p>

<p>It's a simple question, really: are you treating your audience as a valued set of subscribers, whom you have a relationship with? Or as a cohort of data points to be sold to whomever will pay? </p>
<p>There's a spectrum between those two, of course, but where you sit on that spectrum will have a huge impact on how this affects you. </p>
