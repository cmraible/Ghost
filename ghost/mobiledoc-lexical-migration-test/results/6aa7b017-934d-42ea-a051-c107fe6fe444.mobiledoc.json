In addition to putting one of its most powerful power plants behind the driver’s seat, engineers were also able to shave 143-lbs from the Gallardo Spyder thanks to the use of lightweight materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastic throughout the entire design. Lightweight metal also played a big role in the savings as well, such is the case with the 19-inch wheels and titanium wheel bearings and bolts."

Healey did design the aluminum-bodied convertible but instead of producing the bodies himself, production was outsourced and then returned to him for final assembly. It was a complicated, and expensive, collaboration that got even more complicated as production progressed. The next year Pininfarina was tapped in to handle the body work which meant each Nash-Healey was imported and exported from three different countries before reaching its buyer with a sticker price of almost double that of the Corvette."

This particular model Ford was the successor of the Model AA Fords, and was offered in a longer platform. It’s this longer platform that gave it the capacity to hold six-benches and a striped canopy to bus around visitors for the Morton Arboretum in Illinois."

A pivotal moment in BMW racing history and a car that amazes even to this day came about in the late 1960s when two BMW personnel both made the same modifications to their personal 1600-2 coupes, installing 2.0-liter engines in place of the 1.6-liter engines. A request for a sports coupe from Max Hoffmann could not have come at a better time, and thus the BMW 2002 was born. At the 1973 Frankfurt Motor Show the legendary 2002 Turbo was unveiled, becoming BMWs first turbocharged production car."

Along with the fact that they rarely ever get sold in good condition, when they are in good condition they often come with a hefty price tag. While we can't say much for the price, you’ll have to contact the owner for that, the condition of this Charger is perfect. Everyone remembers the Mopar focus on performance from the 60s and 70s. However, this car takes the classic styling of old Mopar and couples it with the blistering performance that we all know Dodge for today."
