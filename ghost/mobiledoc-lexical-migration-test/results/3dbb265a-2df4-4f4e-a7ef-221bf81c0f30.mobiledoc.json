We constantly run into the attitude covid and the lockdowns created the problem, a claim which unravels when you look at car theft data nationwide over the past several years. While we can debate what the cause is, the fact is many cities are awash in the problem with no end in sight. That’s why one Marlboro, New Jersey has decided to impose stiffer penalties on car thefts as they continue spiraling out of control."

While a report from ABC7NY didn’t get into details, it does mention fees for car theft will increase starting on December 15. This sounds like the kind of move which could and probably should spread to more municipalities."
