<p>There is no better prize to reach for this year than the <a href="https://tri-industries.tapkat.org/wina2020fordshelbygt500?utm_campaign=motorious&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=motorious.com" rel="noopener">2020 Shelby GT500</a>. With 760 horsepower from its supercharged 5.2-liter V8, the GT500 is the most powerful factory Mustang ever made. It's been turning the muscle car world on its head with a 0-60 time of just 3.3 seconds and quarter mile time of 10.6 seconds at 133 miles per hour. Those aren't muscle car numbers. They're not even supercar numbers. They're hypercar numbers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tri-industries.tapkat.org/wina2020fordshelbygt500?utm_campaign=motorious&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=motorious.com" rel="noopener">2020 Shelby GT500</a> isn't merely a machine made for speed, though. Based on our time behind the wheel, it's also docile enough to use as your daily driver. Thanks to its magneride suspension system and selectable drive mode system, you can tune the GT500's demeanor to match your own.</p>
<p>Your GT500 grand prize will come in Rapid Red with the killer Painted White Stripes option that costs an insane $10,000! It also has the Carbon Fiber Track Pack ($18,500) with its <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/385580/mustang-shelby-gt500-catch-can/?utm_campaign=motorious&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=motorious.com">hidden surprise</a>, the Technology Package ($3,000) and a Shelby Car Cover ($95). It's as loaded as they come.</p>
