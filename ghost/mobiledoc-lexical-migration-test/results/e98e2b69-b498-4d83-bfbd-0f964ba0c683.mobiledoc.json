When a study starts slicing data differently for different points, it’s usually because using the same time period for everything doesn’t support a narrative being carefully constructed. In fact, that’s what’s going on, because if you dig into the study, data shows year-over-year drops in fatal crashes from 2016 to 2019."

Sadly, because of the panic over covid, in-person outdoor motorcycle safety courses weren’t as plentiful. The result has been many riders on the road without the necessary skills to ride safely. That point is backed up by Las Vegas motorcycle dealership owners in a 2021 report. They’ve seen many people who have never ridden before getting their first motorcycle, hitting the road without understanding how to do so safely, so they started offering free safety classes."

Sometimes it’s a car operator that is a problem, but oftentimes, most crashes can be avoided. So, we call them crashes, not accidents.”"

Then the author contrasts that with the risk of death for people in cars and trucks. His conclusion is motorcycle manufacturers must be force to make their products safer through the use of technologies like stability control, crash warning systems, and anti-lock brakes. Would such technologies prevent a significant number of crashes, or would increasing rider training be more effective?"

They focused on drivers talking on the phone or texting while behind the wheel, despite a state law banning holding a phone while operating a vehicle. I think even most drivers can agree this is a problem, but for me personally it’s one of the top reasons I don’t take anything with two wheels on the road anymore. Another report from November of last year out of New Mexico echoes this sentiment that drivers are more distracted than ever."

Frustrated, officials talked a lot about not only distracted driving, but also driving while intoxicated as well as drivers who just don’t look for motorcycles."

Admittedly, that sharp increase comes as e-bikes went from incredibly rare to more fashionable in the Big Apple, but it does go to show motorcyclists aren’t the only ones on two wheels facing danger on city streets."
