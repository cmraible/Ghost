<p>To make sense of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, corporate media has made a habit of turning to former defense officials. These hawkish talking heads have tended to push for bolder U.S. military action against Russia — with little acknowledgement of how these moves could escalate tensions between the two nuclear-armed superpowers.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qulx0I2Awlg">our new video</a> demonstrates, these pundits are also neglecting to mention something else: Many of them <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-defense-industrys-ukraine-pundits/">are getting paid</a> by defense contractors that stand to profit from increased or prolonged conflict in the region, the threat of World War III be damned.</p>
<p>Who are the biggest talking heads failing to disclose their defense industry ties? Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qulx0I2Awlg">our new video</a> to find out — and then <a href="https://twitter.com/LeverNews/status/1522312682627608576">share it on social media</a> and forward this email to friends and family.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-ukraine-plans-face-wall-street-roadblock/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-national-security-revolving-door/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
