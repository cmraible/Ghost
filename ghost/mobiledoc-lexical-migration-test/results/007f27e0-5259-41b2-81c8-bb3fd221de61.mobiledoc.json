In terms of its historical significance, this 1926 Fordson was the only truck like it to be delivered to a customer, and while it sounds like other Fordson trucks may have been built as prototypes, this one is believed to be the only surviving Fordson truck left in existence. This truck was previously displayed at the National Automobile Museum (The Harrah Collection) in Reno, Nevada before being auctioned off in 1983."

While the engine and transmission were production units, the chassis was purpose-built for this heavy-duty truck. The Fordson prototype used Ford's standard beam axle, transverse leaf spring front end, but to handle the heavier payloads, the truck utilized a unique four-link rear suspension setup with inverted, cantilevered leaf springs."
