<hr>
<p>Pontiac’s up-model to the Tempest coupe was introduced in 1961 <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/3/?ahid=20717">as the LeMans </a>but by 1963 it had come to be recognized as a completely separate model. In 1964 <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/3/?ahid=20717">the LeMans</a> embarked on its second generation which gave way to a high-performance option called the GTO. 1965 marked a dramatic restyling for the model, with a new vertically stacked four headlight and elongated grille front end design and more powerful engine options.</p>

<p>GTO models for 1965 featured 335-horsepower and 360-horsepower engine options and a sportier hood bringing a lot of attention to the model. However, the standard <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/3/?ahid=20717">LeMans model’s</a> accomplishments for the model year were not to be overlooked. These fantastic cars featured exceptional style and were available with a slightly less powerful 326-cid V8 engine.</p>
