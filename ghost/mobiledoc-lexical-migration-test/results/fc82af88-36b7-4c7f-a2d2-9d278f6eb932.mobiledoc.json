          ". Standing for Super Sport, the SS has stunning good looks mixed with big-block power. This fully restored 1969 Camaro Super Sport is finished in a menacing shade of red with a black vinyl top. It has recently undergone a bumper-to-bumper restoration that includes $20,000 of engine-performance upgrades, a show-quality paint job, and a perfect muscle car interior. A four-speed Muncie gearbox offers quick and smooth shifts and a Positraction rear end helps put the power coming from the 350-cid engine to the ground. This 1969 Camaro would be perfect for the Saturday night cruise or cars and coffee or even as a daily driver. All you have to do to enter for the chance to win this car is make a generous donation "
