There are no big AAA titles this week and we are still waiting on a Nintendo Direct. However, there are still a few gems here and we want to highlight each and every one of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Christmas is well behind us and we’ve counted in to the new year, gamers have grown tired of playing games with their family and want to play on their own. Publishers seem to have realised this as this week’s releases are majoritively single-player titles.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: All prices are in AUD and all release dates are for the Australian eShop. Also, releases can still be subjected to change after the release of this update.</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moorhuhn Knights &amp; Castles</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Moorhuhn Knights &amp; Castles for Nintendo Switch Trailer en\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-t6qrObYto?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Developed By </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young Fun Studio</span></p>\n<p><b>Published By </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young Fun Studio</span></p>\n<p><b>Release Date </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">08/01/18</span></p>\n<p><b>Genre </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategy / Action / Shooter / Arcade</span></p>\n<p><b>Price </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$45.00</span></p>\n<p><b>Required Space </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">154 MB</span></p>\n<p><b>Players </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1</span></p>\n<p><b>Also Released On</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build your castle, set up your defences and get ready to fire on your opponent’s castle.
