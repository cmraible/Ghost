Resprayed in its gorgeous hue of Amazon Green just a decade prior with the hood partially repainted at a later date, this car is in pristine shape. Exterior modifications made by the current owner include European-market bumpers and a set of 16-inch Alpina-style alloy wheels wrapped with Bridgestone Potenza RE760 rubber (205/55 front, 225/50 rear). Also, the side marker lights were removed, and the rocker trim, weatherstripping, headlamps, and grilles have been replaced. In 2016, the motor and seals for the optional factory sunroof were replaced as well. "

When new, the power rating is 180-horsepower. Stopping power is provided by disc brakes on all four corners, and Bilstein HD dampers were added back in 2009."

Interior aesthetics include the black upper dash surfaces with fancy wood trim accents. A Retrosound radio was installed that gives a vintage appearance but is equipped with an auxiliary input that plays your favorite tunes through aftermarket speakers that sit in place of the factory speakers. The current owner repaired the driver's seat, and the horn contact switch on the wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel was replaced in 2016. To keep the cabin cook, the air conditioning system was converted to run on R134a refrigerant. In front of the driver is VDO instrumentation that includes a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer that redlines at 6,500-rpm, a clock, and gauge that monitors both water temperature and fuel."
