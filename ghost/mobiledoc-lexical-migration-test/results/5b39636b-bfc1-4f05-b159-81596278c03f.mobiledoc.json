Rebuilding over half the body with new material, Gazoo Racing also reinforced the rockers and suspension mounting points, upgraded the ignition system, and updated its interior. Painted white, red, and black to match Gazoo Racing’s modern livery, the race car is stunning and due to the extra chassis and suspension reinforcement, and better ignition system the car performs better than it did in its prime."

          ", and years of build up to it, Toyota is really making headlines. But as exciting as this news is, with this restoration Toyota has proved it is not a one-trick pony. While the brands focus may be mainly on where they are headed, they clearly haven’t forgotten where they have come from and take great pride in their history. Toyota’s efforts in 1966 set the stage for their successful heritage in motorsports and the restoration of the winning Sport 800 pays perfect homage to that heritage."
