<p><a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26617/lot/110/?category=list&length=12&page=1">The Porsche 356</a> is considered by many enthusiasts to be one of the all-time great sports cars. Some even may consider them to be on par with the 550 Spyder and the 911 though not quite as powerful as either. As the <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26617/lot/110/?category=list&length=12&page=1">first Porsche model</a>, the 356 was based off of the Volkswagen Beetle which Ferry Porsche’s father designed. </p>
<p>By 1954, the 356 had undergone many changes and upgrades and a limited production variant dubbed the 356 Speedster was tailored by Max Hoffman to bring the roadster to the American market. Only 200 were built in its first year of production. With so much interest, production numbers jumped to more than 1,000 the following year. The 1958 model year was one of the most desirable <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26617/lot/110/?category=list&length=12&page=1">356 Speedster’s</a> thanks to multiple upgrades, including a refined transaxle and steering box design. In all less than 1,500 356 Speedsters were made that year.</p>
