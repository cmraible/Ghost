Paired up with that is a Tremec 5-speed manual transmission for that pure, three-pedal driving experience."

That’s not the case with this ride, with a 2.5-year build sparing no expense and addressing each detail to high standards. In other words, this is a car which not only looks great, it should perform beautifully as you push it on the track."
