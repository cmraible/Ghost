<p>Jeep made a big name for itself in the late 1940s and early 1950s for their incredible feats both on the battlefield as well as the American roadways. Everything from conquering mud bogs to rock climbs could be accomplished with the right Jeep model. However, most people don’t know that Jeeps are also in the business of making good road cars for their time as well. One of the main proponents of showcasing Jeeps versatility both on and off the road was called the Willys. At the upcoming Carlisle Auctions spring sale, a few examples will be ready for a new garage, which would you choose?</p>
