<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder — our first Daily Poster live chat starts today at <strong>5:45pm ET (4:45pm Chicago time, 3:45 Denver time, 2:45 West Coast time)</strong>.</p>
<p>This event is exclusively for supporting subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>To participate, subscribers should go to this link: <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-daily-posters/"><strong>https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-daily-posters/</strong></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Use the password: DailyPoster2020</strong></p>
<p>We are starting 15 minutes earlier than originally announced because we have added Bernie 2020 pollster Ben Tulchin to the lineup. He is going to give us a rundown of the polling in advance of Election Day. Then we will chat with journalist Naomi Klein.</p>
<p>You will be able to ask questions of all of us.</p>
<p>I hope you will join the conversation — it should be fun.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
