<p>If you’re going to tow a trailer using a Lamborghini, the Urus would probably be the most reasonable option. Even more reasonable would be to grab one of the very capable and proven full-size pickup trucks a Lamborghini owner could undoubtedly afford with ease. However, there’s little fun or drama in doing the reasonable thing, especially when it comes to YouTube videos where ridiculous and outlandish reigns supreme, which is why one YouTuber decided to tow his Urus on a trailer using his Huracan.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, the trailer and Urus tip the scale at over 10,000 lbs. That’s a lot for even some pickup trucks to handle. Don’t worry, the Lamborghini Huracan is heavily modified, thanks to forced induction via twin snails, putting down well over 1,000-horsepower – at least according to the owner.</p>
<p>Instead of just jumping into the fire and towing over 10,000 pounds using his heavy-duty hitch attached to the Lambo’s frame, he works up to it. He starts off by hauling a dirt bike on the hitch. Later he goes to a U-Haul store and tries to convince them to rent a car trailer for use on the supercar, which didn’t go over well at all.</p>

<p>Borrowing a trailer from a friend, he tries going for it with pulling his Urus. However, there’s a problem with fitting the Italian-German SUV on the trailer itself, showing that maybe, just maybe, this whole plan was a bad idea from the get-go. But the guy doesn’t let that deter him, even though he’s forced to abandon his plans for a moment.</p>
<p>Lots of random things happen in this video, a hallmark of many YouTubers’ style. You might find that annoying or you might find it amazing, depending on if you grew up watching screens constantly instead of spending time outside. Ultimately, he tows several vehicles on the trailer, even doing stupid stunts which on the road which could get someone killed. All of this is for clicks, and with almost 1.8 million views on the video at the time of writing this, it seems to be working.</p>
<p>Check out the video for yourself, if you so dare.</p>
