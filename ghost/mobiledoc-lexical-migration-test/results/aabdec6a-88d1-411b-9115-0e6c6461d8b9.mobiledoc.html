<p>Well, it’s looking like the judgement that gives people the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-05/cp140070en.pdf">“right to be forgotten”</a> is rapidly becoming the “right to censor”. In the last 24 hours I’ve seen these:</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28130581">blog post from Robert Peston</a> has been “forgotten”:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Now in my blog, only one individual is named. He is Stan O’Neal, the former boss of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.</p>
    <p>My column describes how O’Neal was forced out of Merrill after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made.</p>
    <p>Is the data in it “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant”?</p>

<p>A whole chunk of <em>Guardian</em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/02/eu-right-to-be-forgotten-guardian-google">stories have been effectively removed from Google’s index</a>, for the purposes of direct searching:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The first six articles down the memory hole – there will likely be many more as the rich and powerful look to scrub up their online images, doubtless with the help of a new wave of “reputation management” firms – are a strange bunch.</p>
    <p>Three of the articles, dating from 2010, relate to a now-retired Scottish Premier League referee, Dougie McDonald, who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a Celtic v Dundee United match, the backlash to which prompted his resignation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stories are still live on <em>The Guardian</em> site – they just can’t be easily found through the obvious Google searches.</p>
<p>Anyone seen any others yet?</p>
