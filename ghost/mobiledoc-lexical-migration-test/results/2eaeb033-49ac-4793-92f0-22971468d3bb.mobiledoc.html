<p>We have keys to keep people from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">breaking into our homes, businesses, and cars</a>. They’re an essential safety measure, so it’s understandable <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-orlando-classic-cars/">why thieves would be focused on swiping them</a>. However, a different kind of scheme had been swirling around the theft of almost 2,000 vehicle key fobs in February 2018. We know the details of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alleged-ford-gt-flip-scheme-ends-in-lawsuit/">alleged crime</a> thanks to reports detailing recent court filings.</p>
<p>Jason Gibbs has been accused in Detroit federal court of taking the key fobs before new cars, trucks, and SUVs from Ford, General Motors, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-dodge-charger-scat-pack-widebody-review/">Fiat Chrysler</a> were shipped to dealerships. Complaints began pouring in from the dealers that new vehicles had arrived with just one key fob instead of two.</p>

<p>Authorities claim Gibbs was taking the key fobs and selling them on eBay or through an unnamed person in Foothill Ranch, California. The intent was for people to pay $69 to $160 for the brand new key fobs, then have them reprogrammed for their vehicle. Some speculate the fobs might not have been reprogrammed but instead were used to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-steal-hellcats/">steal cars from dealerships</a> in the Detroit area.</p>
<p>Gibbs worked for a contractor for CSX, Auto Warehousing Co., which processed new vehicles before they were loaded onto trains. This would have given him access to the key fobs.</p>
<p>It’s bad enough that drivers with newer vehicles need to worry about people replicating the signal from their key fob in a public parking lot, now there’s a possibility someone out there has one of the original key fobs. There’s no indication in the court filing that car VINs were supplied with the purchase of a fob, but this serves are a reminder that you might want to do a little more to secure your vehicles, especially with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">theft at a high during the coronavirus lockdowns</a>.</p>
