<hr>
<p>In the ever-evolving automotive industry, it's important to try and stay ahead of the curve. GM did just that with its <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">C8 Corvette</a>, now a mid-engine configuration found in high-end exotics such as Lamborghini and Ferrari. Even more, <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">the new 'Vette</a> is considered the most powerful entry-level model to date with the quickest acceleration time, but that is if opting for the high-performance Z51 package. Here we have an opportunity to own a potent <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">2020 Chevrolet Corvette Z51</a> through the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation (CMAF). </p>

<p>One of the Corvette's biggest enthusiasts was Chip Miller, who owned about 80 of them over his lifetime. He was also the founder of Carlisle events with his business partner Bill Miller (no relation). Sadly, Chip Miller passed away in 2004 of amyloidosis, and that's when his wife Judy and partner Bill started the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation in his honor. Many know Carlisle as the place to be for collector and classic cars as it is one of the biggest events in the country, and the Spring Carlisle show is a must on every enthusiast's calendar. Corvettes of Carlisle is the largest gathering of 'Vettes in the world, bringing in about 5,000 each time.</p>
<p>Even the exterior of the new <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">2020 C8 Corvette</a> screams supercar with an aerodynamic body that doesn't follow the norm. The mold was broken with the C8, and this Z51 features the Carbon Flash Exterior Badge Package with exterior accents, side vents, and front/rear grille accents. More exterior features include a unique rear spoiler and front splitter along with front brake cooling inlets. A set of staggered Bright Silver-painted aluminum 5-spoke wheels grace the exterior and come wrapped with all-season black-wall performance rubber (245/35ZR19 front, 305/30ZR20 rear). Other options include front intermittent wipers, daytime running lamps, LED headlamps, Solar-Ray light-tinted glass, a removable roof panel that is color-matched. Even the manual-folding side mirrors come with turn signal indicators, and they are also outside-heated and power-adjustable.</p>
<p><a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">Powering the C8 Z51</a> is a mid-mounted LT2 6.2-liter V8 engine with direct injection, variable valve timing, and active fuel management that comes backed by a M1L 8-speed dual-clutch transmission featuring manual and auto modes. Sitting on an aluminum-structured frame, the Z51 package includes a performance rear axle ratio and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Stopping power is provided by anti-lock and disc brakes on all four corners with black-painted brake calipers. Keeping the Corvette in line and planted to the ground is the FE1 Corvette suspension, all-speed traction control, and active handling stability control. Additional performance and adding to the V8's soundtrack is the aluminized stainless steel exhaust with stainless tips. The oil life monitoring system keeps vital signs in check. </p>
<p>Generating a stout 495-horsepower and 470 lb/ft of torque, <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">the new Corvette Z51 </a>can reach a top speed of 184 miles per hour. It can also sprint from 0 to 60 in just 2.9 seconds and dominate the quarter-mile in 11.2 seconds during testing. Dyno testing actually shows that GM may have underrated the power input with some reading as high as 558-horsepower and 515 lb/ft of torque at the wheels. </p>
<p>Behind the doors of <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP5">this Z51 'Vette </a>are GT1 Competition seats with Mulan leather seating surfaces complete with perforated inserts. In front of the driver sits a leather-wrapped steering wheel with power tilt and telescoping functionality. You favorite tunes can be bumped through a Bose 10-spark premium sound system. An 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen displays Chevrolet's latest infotainment systems along with a 12-inch cluster display that can be changed to any color your heart desires. Of course, the car is equipped with an HD rear-vision backup camera and keyless open and start.</p>
