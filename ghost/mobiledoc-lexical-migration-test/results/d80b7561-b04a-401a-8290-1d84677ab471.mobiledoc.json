Sponsors helped with the fundraising, as did Ferrari customers. There was even a silent auction with several items featured, like a painting of God touching Adam’s finger, just like on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, only with a Ferrari F40 between the two. This proves yet again car people have heart and love to help out others in need, especially children."
