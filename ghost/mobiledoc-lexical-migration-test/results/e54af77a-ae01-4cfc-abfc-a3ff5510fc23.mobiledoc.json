Ford thinks it can leverage this phenomena to get everyone really excited for the next-generation Mustang when it’s revealed on September 14 by asking fans to dress up as their favorite generation of the pony car."

It also suggests there will be a two-to-one female-to-male ratio for this contest, which could be the truth."
