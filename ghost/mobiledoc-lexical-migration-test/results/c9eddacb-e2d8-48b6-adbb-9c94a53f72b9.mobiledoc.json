          "A former Mercedes-Benz employee in Spain decided to go on a spree of wanton destruction just before the beginning of the new year, apparently out of disgust for his ex-employer. The 38 year-old man reportedly used a front loader to break into a facility and trash about 50 Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles, causing considerable damages we’re sure will total a large sum. It all went down at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vitoria, which is in the middle of Basque Country in the northwestern portion of the country."

While here in the United States we don’t have too many high-end luxury vans wearing the three-point star, in Europe and other markets Mercedes-Benz vans like the V-Class are quite popular."

That might be a relief to enthusiasts who were concerned something cool and rare was wrecked by a disgruntled former employee, but keep in mind a V-Class can sell for nearly six figures, meaning the damage done was financially significant."

It was also handy for smashing, gouging, and even flipping different vehicles as he reportedly exercised his rage. He reportedly stole the bulldozer, meaning he’s likely facing charges for that as well as the damage he caused and probably a few other laws broken."
