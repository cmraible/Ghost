<p>This car, <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444471/1965-shelby-427-cobra-roadster/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">chassis number CSX3178</a>, was owned by Carroll Shelby since new until his death in 2016. Originally, it was painted in charcoal grey – one of just five 427 Cobras finished in this color.</p>

<p>It was <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444471/1965-shelby-427-cobra-roadster/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">originally delivered</a> to Carroll Shelby's ranch in Texas in early days of March of 1965. A few years later, in 1972, Shelby had the car repainted in Guardsman Blue with a gold front end.</p>
<p>At some point, the original 427 cubic inch V8, fed by a pair of four barrel carburetors and backed up by a Top Loader four speed manual transmission, was ditched. It was replaced by an aluminum head 427 side-oiler engine and an automatic transmission. Shelby, apparently, needed <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444471/1965-shelby-427-cobra-roadster/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">even more power</a>.</p>

<p>In 2002, the Cobra was once again repainted, this time in red. When Shelby passed away in 2016, this car was purchased from his estate, and it was almost <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444471/1965-shelby-427-cobra-roadster/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">immediately restored</a> to the same condition it was in when it was originally delivered.</p>
<p>Every original Cobra is special, and to collectors, that's doubly true for 427 Cobras. <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444471/1965-shelby-427-cobra-roadster/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This car</a>, though, is the most special one of all, being Carroll Shelby's personal car. The auction listing states that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we'd agree – that's not just sales hype. </p>

<p>Now it gets to go home to a very lucky new owner, and we will continue to track its legacy.</p>
