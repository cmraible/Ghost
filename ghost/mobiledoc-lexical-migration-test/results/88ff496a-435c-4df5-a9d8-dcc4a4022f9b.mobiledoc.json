The game is overall challenging yet absolutely fair, except for some short yet very poignant and mandatory sequences where the player is subjected to having their progress and upgrades invalidated and enemies that permanently diminish their health. It makes for a few sections where the difficulty feels more like padding and unfair rather than the previously seen straight and narrow difficulty approach - although temporary, it certainly leaves a lasting and annoying impression."
