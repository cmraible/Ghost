Featuring Rothman's livery, the car is one of the most recognizable Porsche cars involved in motorsports. It was driven by #186 by René Metge (winner of the Paris-Dakar in 1981 and 1984 while piloting a Porsche Type 953 911, and again in 1986 behind the wheel of a Porsche 959) along with Dominique Lemoyne.
