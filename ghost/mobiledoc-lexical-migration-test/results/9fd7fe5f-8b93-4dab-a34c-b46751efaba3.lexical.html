<p>If you were to argue that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/buy-this-rare-1962-mg-mga-mk-ii-roadster/">British</a> made some of the most entertaining, stylish, and performance-oriented <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1932-bugatti-type-55-super-sport-roadster-to-auction-for-big-money/">roadsters</a> in the 1950s, you would definitely be able to defend that position. That’s what made cars like this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/bid-on-this-1956-austin-healey-100m-bn2-roadster/">Austin-Healey</a> 3000 Mark I BN7 so enjoyable for drivers in America who wanted <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-sunbeam-tiger-auction/">something which they could push through turns on open country roads</a>, yet not spend a fortune to buy or maintain. Today, these British roadsters are much harder to come by, especially in such <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/immaculate-1964-jaguar-e-type-series-i-available-now/">immaculate condition</a>.</p>

<p>This Big Healey went through a full rotisserie restoration, so everything on the body, chassis, and interior looks amazing. It’s the perfect way to transport yourself back to the late 1950s while feeling that perfect mix of driving engagement and refined comforts.</p>

<p>For two years this Austin-Healey 3000 was stripped down and restored to its factory condition by marque specialists at Fourintune Garage. The painstakingly detailed work brings back all of the original glory of this roadster, of which a mere 1,691 were made.</p>

<p>Thanks to the professional restoration, the results faithfully adhere to factory specifications. It wears the correct Primrose Yellow and Black paint, a black canvas convertible top, 15-inch Dayton 72 wire wheels, and is powered by a 2.9-liter British Motor Corporation 29AH six-cylinder engine with twin carburetion. The four-speed manual transmission even has the correct, optional electric overdrive.</p>

<p>The Black interior features yellow seat piping and many other factory-correct options, like a heater telescoping steering column, and a Les Leston steering wheel. Restoration photos and a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certified Copy of a Factory Record are included with the roadster.</p>
