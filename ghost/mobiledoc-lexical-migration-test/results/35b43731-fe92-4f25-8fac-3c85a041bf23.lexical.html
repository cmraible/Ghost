<p>The Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance is the annual jewel in the classic automotive crown. Nowhere else will you find such high caliber cars sharing the same space, with many competing for the prestigious top prize. Several auctions will be conducted over the event with <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/auction/pebble-beach-2019/" rel="noopener">Gooding & Company</a> offering some highly decorated machines.</p>
<p>Gooding & Company has revealed the first lots to go under the hammer on 16 - 17 August 2019 at Pebble Beach. One such star car is a <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/vehicle/1958-ferrari-250-gt-tour-de-france-berlinetta-2/" rel="noopener">1958 Ferrari 250 GT Tour de France Berlinetta</a> — a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/special-edition-cars/" rel="noopener">special car</a> in any circumstance, but his one even more so as its restoration by Motion Products Inc received a Platinum Award at the 2013 Cavallino Classic.</p>
<p>Also in the Ferrari's trophy cabinet is a first-place Blue Ribbon awarded at the 2013 Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance, and a Premio d’Onore award at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2013.</p>
