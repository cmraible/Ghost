In place of the Mk I's factory 260 cubic-inch Ford V8, this one comes with a 347 cubic-inch V8 that has been tuned to produce a whopping 426 horsepower, which is laid to the rear tires through a Tremec five-speed manual gearbox. Add in the MagnaFlow performance exhaust, roll bar and Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes, and you're looking at a small British roadster that is ready to dominate any road course. With the modern setup, it's just as capable of cruising to car shows, too."

          "From the factory, the Sunbeam Tiger was a surprising little roadster, but this example is by no means a sleeper thanks to that Competition Yellow paint job and the lowered stance; there's no doubt that this car is all business. The polished set of American Racing wheels finishes off the Tiger's aggressive stance, and the interior received equally sporty upgrades with bolstered leather seats and vintage-style gauges. Finally, the engine compartment and undercarriage are just as clean as the rest of the car."
