<hr>
<p>When <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/prince-philips-royal-car-collection/">Prince Philip</a> is finally interred, his body will be taken on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-redeye-hearse/">that final trip</a> through the grounds of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/queen-elizabeth-bentley-limousine/">Windsor Castle</a> in the back of his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/land-rover-defender-90/">Land Rover Defender</a> 130 Gun Bus. The highly customized truck was built by Foley Specialist Vehicles with significant input from the Duke of Edinburgh. Completion of the work was achieved back in 2016.</p>
<blockquote><em>A better way to go out is in the back of a Dodge Hellcat Redeye hearse you can see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-redeye-hearse/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Created as a transport for hunting parties on the grounds of the royal family’s Sandringham House estate, it’s a pretty big departure from what you’d normally find in a Land Rover <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-land-rover-defender-ev-conversion/">Defender</a> 130. It was more recently outfitted to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/flamethrower-cadillac-hearse/">serve as a hearse</a> at Prince Philip’s request. He yet again provided feedback on what it would feature as far as customizations.</p>

<p>Prince Philip’s Gun Bus has been appointed quite nicely with French Oak trim, green leather seats, all LED lighting, and plenty of storage compartments. Those large windows in the back also open, providing fresh air for the up to 10 passengers, plus there are 2 roof vents.</p>

<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2003-aston-martin-vanquish-royal-family-auction/">royal family</a> has a longstanding relationship with Land Rover, especially Queen Elizabeth II, who served as a mechanic during WWII. While members of the royal family traditionally have been carried to the grave in a horse-drawn carriage, it seems fitting Prince Philip takes that final journey in the back of the Land Rover Defender.</p>
<p>Jaguar Land Rover released an official statement the day Prince Philip passed away:</p>
<blockquote><em>At Jaguar Land Rover, we are deeply saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Our thoughts and condolences are with Her Majesty The Queen and the Royal Family at this time. His Royal Highness devoted his life to public service and made a significant contribution to British manufacturing, engineering and design.</em></blockquote>
