            "text": "The chip shortage seems to have been driven by a variety of factors, although most news outlets focus almost exclusively on the novel coronavirus. As Fortune noted recently, the freak winter storm which hit Texas in February shuttered semiconductor factories there. Then a drought in Taiwan at about the same time constrained manufacturing there. In March there was a fire at a Renesas factory in Japan, one of the key chip suppliers for the auto industry. Call it a series of unfortunate events, the end result is cars both new and used are overly expensive as automakers struggle to make new ones.",
