          "Imagine spending $420,000 to sit in the same 1987 Ferrari Testarossa as Elton John. Someone did just that recently as the musician’s old sports car crossed the auction block. You might think that’s a crazy figure to pay for any Testarossa, a Ferrari some have looked down on rather harshly. Or you might think that’s a bit much to shell out for anything which has been sat in by Elton John – the opinions on this one probably run the spectrum."

The only explanation for the bidding bonanza on the Ferrari was the fact Elton John owned it for an extended period. Many times celebrity-owned cars sell for more on the open market as people who are big fans seem willing to pay large sums to own something which once was used by their idol. A lot of people were watching this auction, with the lot listing recording 9,440 views."
