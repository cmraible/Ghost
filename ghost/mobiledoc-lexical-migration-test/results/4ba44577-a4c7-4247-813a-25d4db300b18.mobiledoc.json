When you’ve got the right image on the camera, you print-screen and fax it to Dr Scholz, at which point she calls you on the phone in your caravan if you’ve been successful with your image capturing."

Yes, you do spend most, if not all, of your time positioning cameras to try and capture images of cute squirrels, but this game is set against a significantly darker backdrop with a plot that intertwines scientific research with environmental and deforestation issues. I’m not sure if this is what the developers intended but throughout the whole game, I was expecting some kind of Blair Witch Project situation to develop because it really does have a creepy undertone to it.
