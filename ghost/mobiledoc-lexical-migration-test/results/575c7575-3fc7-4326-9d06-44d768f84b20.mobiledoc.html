<p><a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">The Ford Mustang GT500</a> is already a powerful beast of a car with over 750-horsepower. <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">Ford's Signature Edition package</a>, however, bumps the Mustangs power output to more than 800-horsepower and adds a ton of other features. The bad news is that the production was limited to only 100 examples in 2020 and those examples came with a hefty price increase. While it is not completely clear if more or less of these limited production packages will be made in 2021, what is clear is that you do not have to worry about that if you win this one.</p>

<p>So what makes <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">this particular GT500 special</a>? Besides a blistering 800-horsepower, nearly everything else about it. From the extra sharp handling to the new Antimatter Blue paint, this is a true one-of-one Mustang. It comes with nearly every optional package, including the Technology Package and the Carbon Fiber Track Package. The interior is finished with a slick leather upholstery that features an embroidered Carrol Shelby signature. <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">One of the best features of this car</a>, though, is that it was made specifically to benefit a cause that affects way too many people.</p>
