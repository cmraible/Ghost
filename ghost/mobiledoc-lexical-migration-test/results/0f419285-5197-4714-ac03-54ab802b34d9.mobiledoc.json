According to police, crime gangs are paying teens and young adults to boost the vehicles, which then are used to commit all sorts of violent crimes, including murders. We see this sort of thing here in the US as well as in Canada, the UK, and pretty much everywhere else. However, the problem seems to be especially bad in the Sydney area."

For example, the police recovered an S550 Mustang, which might be a nice car here but isn’t a BMW E-Class. Just keep in mind in Australia a Mustang is foreign and fairly rare, plus vehicles cost significantly more there. Also, the Aussie auto market has been flooded not only by cheap Korean brands like Kia and Hyundai, but even cheaper Chinese brands. We actually really feel for them because of all that, especially since there used to be some really cool cars made Down Under."
