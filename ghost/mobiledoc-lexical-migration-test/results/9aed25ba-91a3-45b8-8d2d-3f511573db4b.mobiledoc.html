<p>With the year cooling down, the November <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles?q%5Bbranch_id_eq%5D=34?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars auction</a> is only heating up! For the next few days, some of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-for-sale-pollenocolyspe/">coolest cars ever made</a> will exchange hands, and Motorious is front and center to bring you the results, the stories, and imagery that will put you in the moment.</p>
<p>From now until Saturday, 650 cars will go up for sale, and we fully expect to see some record breaking bids. There are special collections being featured, and there is truly something for everyone. If you browse our site, you’ll see that we’ve already been hard at work publishing the highlights ahead of the auction, and are now on the floor.</p>
<p>As you would expect with such a large docket, bidding happens fast, and these cars are snatched up by brokers and individual buyers who are looking for their next toy, or an investment.</p>
