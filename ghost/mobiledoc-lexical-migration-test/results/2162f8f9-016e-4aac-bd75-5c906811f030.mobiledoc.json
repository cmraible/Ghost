Now that’s a very odd situation since we’ve been told both by Australians and Americans that gun crime doesn’t happen Down Under thanks to gun control."

There was a “short pursuit” at low speeds, but officers abandoned it “due to safety concerns for other road users.” We don’t really understand the logic in that since the vehicle was speed-limited, but whatever."
