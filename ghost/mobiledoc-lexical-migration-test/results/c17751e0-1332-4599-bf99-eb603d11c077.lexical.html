<hr>
<p>Even before it was announced that the first-year <a href="https://corvettemike.com/c8-corvettes/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">C8 Corvettes</a> are going to be pure unobtanium at your local Chevrolet dealership, these cars were already selling extremely fast on the resale market. Due to the COVID shutdown, only 2,700 mid-engine Corvettes have rolled off the Bowling Green, Kentucky assembly line, but if you're in the market for a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette, <a href="https://corvettemike.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike</a> has you covered!</p>
<p>So which one of these rare 'Vettes would you choose?</p>
<p><a href="https://corvettemike.com/used-corvettes-for-sale/2020-black-corvette-z-51-coupe/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious"><strong>Black 3LT Z51</strong></a></p>

<p>With just seven miles showing on the odometer, this C8 Z51 is about as close as you can get to buying a brand-new 2020 Corvette. On the outside, this car looks sinister in all black with the bright red brake calipers, and opening the door reveals an interior covered in Adrenaline Red leather decked out in the Corvette's top 3LT trim level. There's no price listed for this C8, but it will likely cost more than the orange Corvette below to bring this bad boy home.</p>

<p>This Corvette definitely has more visual impact painted in the eye-catching Sebring Orange, and although it does have delivery-low miles, its odometer reading of just 112 miles is still pretty close to brand new. Starting with the 2LT trim level, this Corvette adds plenty of options like the performance data recorder, navigation, Carbon Flash aluminum wheels and the performance exhaust system that bumps the engine's output up to 495 horsepower. To go along with all of its added equipment and the car's overall rarity, this C8 2LT Z51 is priced at $115,328.</p>
