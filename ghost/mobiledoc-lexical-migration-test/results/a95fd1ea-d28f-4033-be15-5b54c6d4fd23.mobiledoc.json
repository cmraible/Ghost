That’s clearly illustrated by this Ford Model A which was abandoned in the woods for over 8 years, yet the owner was able to get it started in short order without much trouble. These things were built to be durable, reliable workhorses, not some iPhone on wheels which cracked apart because the temperature changed to quickly, needing thousands and thousands in repairs just to run again."

This guy is one of the better-known master car detailers out there, thanks to his popular YouTube channel and great work ethic. Seriously, the guy knows his stuff and executes well on projects like this, so his fame is well-earned."

The guy calls this a “disaster” detailing because as you can imagine the grime has built up in disgusting ways during all that time. However, he gets everything to just come pouring off the body and all the different nooks, instantly transforming how the classic car looks."

Not everyone is a huge fan of patina and that issue can be argued for days on end, but with this Ford it seems appropriate and adds character. Plus, the vehicle has been in the guy’s family this entire time, so all those blemishes are like part of a legacy."
