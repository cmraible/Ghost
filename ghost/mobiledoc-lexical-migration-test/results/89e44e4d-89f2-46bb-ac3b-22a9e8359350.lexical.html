<p>Besides being one of the most potent cars on the racetrack, one of the coolest things about the 2019 ZR1 is just how unique it is. As a model, nothing else on the road comes even close to looking like it. Even the Stingray only vaguely resembles it and that's only in looks. Performance wise, the ZL1 may just be the fastest production car on the street. Unfortunately for the dreamers out there, its uniqueness is what also makes the ZR1 extremely hard to get your hands on. On an individual car basis, General Motors offered almost limitless options and packages, allowing buyers to tailor the ZR1 to their liking. All things considered, if you are looking at one of these fantastic cars chances are you might just be looking at one of the only ZR1s like it.</p>

<p>General Motors was probably the biggest beneficiary of the Pace Car program, and in 1967 the new Chevrolet Camaro got a big boost from the marketing genius. The Ermine White Camaro SS/RS convertible wearing contrasting Blue graphics with a Bright Blue interior was an instant hit which helped solidify an epic place in history for the Camaro. Of the 285,748 Camaro’s produced in 1967 only 104 of them were Official Pace Car models, so getting your hand on one has never been an easy task.</p>

<p>There are an infinite number of custom classic builds out there, but we can't think of one that has as much attitude and know-how as this 1941 Dodge Command. The Command Car was part of Dodge's WC military vehicle lineup that pre-dated the Dodge Power Wagon, and this example, being auctioned off by Cord & Kruise, combines the truck's vintage looks with a modern chassis and powertrain, making it one of the most unique restomod trucks you'll find.</p>

<p>Built Not Bought. This is the Factory Five Racing motto. While truly unique, it is also a bit of a throwback to a time in automotive history that has in many ways been squashed by the big names in the automotive industry. Nevertheless, kit cars have survived as a dream car for many in the automotive community and just like the Cobra, Factory Five Racing kit cars are some of the best. Despite the gritty and tough Motto though, you actually can buy one of these awesome kit cars fully completed.</p>
