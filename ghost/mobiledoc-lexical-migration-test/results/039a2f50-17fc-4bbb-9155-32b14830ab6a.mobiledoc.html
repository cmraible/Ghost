<hr>
<p>Using the upcoming London Classic Car Show as a backdrop, <em>The Grand Tour</em> host <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/richard-hammond-sold-motorcycle/">Richard Hammond</a> will be revealing his new classic car restoration business. That’s right, the man who <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hammond-screwed-up-jaguar/">messed up his classic Jaguar XK150</a> is now going to help others restore their classic rides. Well, to be fair the man will own the restoration business but likely won’t be managing its day-to-day affairs. And we feel confident he won’t be performing the restoration work himself. In other words, this business has a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/richard-hammond-car-thieves/">fighting chance</a> to really make it.</p>
<blockquote><em>See how Hammond screwed up his classic Jaguar <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hammond-screwed-up-jaguar/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Called The Smallest Cog, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/british-authority-richard-hammond/">new business</a> of Hammond’s will be fully revealed at the show on Saturday, June 26 at Talks Theatre. This venture is as much about fueling the man’s passion for classic cars as it is supporting the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/former-rolls-royce-factory/">talented craftsmen</a> who work hard to restore them using true skill. Working with Hammond on the project are Neil and Anthony Greenhouse, whom you might recognize from Hammond’s video updates.</p>

<p>Of course, Hammond has a personal connection to automotive craftsmanship. His grandfather was a coachbuilder at Mulliners and Jensen. Already, The Smallest Cog team has been laboring to restore a few of Hammond’s cars, which will be on display at the show. If you follow the man on YouTube, you have been getting some updates, but this will be a chance for those who can make it to London to see the cars in the flesh. One of those cars is indeed the Jaguar XK150. Adding to the excitement is the announcement that a surprise will be on display, possibly a guest.</p>
<p>The London Classic Car Show will be held June 25-27 at Syon Park. The show is celebrating its 7th year and has become a gathering for not only enthusiasts but collectors, classic car owners, and industry experts. With Hammond making his announcement at the show, awareness of its existence will only increase.</p>
