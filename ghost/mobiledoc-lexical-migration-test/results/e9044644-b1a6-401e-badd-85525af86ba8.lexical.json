By combining a few key\nelements into a landing page and ensuring that the traffic is made up of\nqualified visitors then they can have a higher percentage than the average of\napproximately 4%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing landing pages need a strong image\nor video, an obvious call to action, the use of a compelling header and sub-header,\nan outline of the features and benefits, and some form of social proof. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are 7 examples of high conversion\nlanding pages and what they are doing right: </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nedX</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a conversion rate of 52.68% <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\">edX is in the education industry</a> and offers\nonline courses. They chose to place a simple message on their landing page that\noffers a few precise points about what can be learned from the course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their reasoning behind keeping the message so\nsimple was that no matter how much they babbled on about what the course\noffers, the extra information would not convince people to take it and would be\na wasted effort.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSimply Business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurance industry has a vast array of\nproducts and the legal terminology behind them are often too complex for most\npeople to understand. Simply Business has a conversion rate of 62,26% and their\nsuccess lies in how they present their products in a way that’s easy for people\nto understand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their introduction appeases the concerns\npeople have about the cost and difficulty of getting insured. People are\noffered with the bulleted steps to an easy sign-up and then they are given a\ncall to action where they then proceed to fill in their details, a little more\nchallenging by now, but at this stage, most users are convinced enough proceed\nfurther. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe Listing Lab</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring a simple design, this website for\nrealtors shows all the information a visitor needs on the landing page with no\nneed to scroll down. Even though there is quite a bit of text it is has been\neffectively arranged and condensed to look neat and uncrowded.&nbsp; The text is bold, the call to action nicely\npointed out and easy to find. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The content offers alternatives to problems\nfaced by realtors in copy that is benefit-oriented convincing the user to read\nthe guide and improve their business. Their privacy statement is casual, yet\ninstills confidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTyresOnTheDrive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This landing page offers clarity and the\nuser can instantly see that they don’t have to go out of their way to have\ntheir tires changed but TyresOnTheDrive will go to them. Once again\nbenefit-oriented advertising is creating the conversions rather than offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also take the opportunity to use their\nlanding page to back their service with social proof. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nExtreme Lounging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extreme Lounging proves how a simple\nlanding page can be extremely effective as well. Nothing other than a huge\nimage, a headline and an email form that prompts visitors to subscribe and stand\na chance to win a chair from their limited edition. The concept is simple: a\ngiveaway campaign is used to create leads. The message is just as simple:\nVisitors exchange their email for the chance to win the chair they desire. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTwillory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This shirt company has a conversion rate of\n46,85% and is a firm believer in offering its mobile visitors custom\nexperiences. Most consumers make their first contact with brands on their\nphones and most online audiences are now on mobile. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twillory.com/\">Twillory</a>\nhas created a separate experience for its mobile users and while its desktop\nlanding page uses elements like videos and GIFs to drive conversions, its\nmobile version is leaner but just as appealing and has a fast loading speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBestMattressBrand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bestmattress-brand.org/\">BestMatressBrand’s</a> land page leaves\nno doubt in the user’s mind that this is where they will find a good mattress,\nbase, and bedding for their new bedroom. Their landing page has a high\nconversion rate and this can be attributed to several reasons. It uses a captivating\nimage and outlines the benefits of buying from the website in a concise and\norganized format with bold print with a header and sub-header. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Like\nmost high converting landing pages, BestMattressBrand uses social proof on\ntheir landing page in the form of a few well-placed reviews that draw the\nvisitor’s attention. Their call to action is cleverly placed, offers a chance\nto win one of the premium mattresses if the user registers. </p>\n"
