The third option is exactly what makes this 1965 Shelby 427 Cobra FAM listed by Mecum for its upcoming Glendale 2021 auction so interesting. We’re expecting bidding for this American sports car to be pretty fierce, making this lot something worth watching when it crosses the block."

          "If you know about Paul Walker beyond just that he was in the Fast and Furious franchise, you might be aware the actor was a savvy car investor. The guy had a knack for sniffing out vehicles which would appreciate nicely over time, whether they were American muscle cars, European luxury models, or JDM sports cars. And in this case Walker certainly seemed to have honed in on something quite special."

In true Carroll Shelby fashion, FAM stands for “Ferrari’s Ass is Mine.” To emphasize that statement, this Cobra wars Rosso Corsa over Tan, the classic Ferrari color combo."

It still has the numbers-matching Shelby 427ci FE V8, an aluminum monster which should offer plenty of fun for anyone brave (and rich) enough to even dare driving the roadster. Paired to that is a Tremec TKO600 5-speed manual."
