All chrome trim is show-quality, and the beautiful paint could not be better. In pristine condition inside and out, this car went under the knife for a full frame-off restoration cosmetically and mechanically and was brought back to factory specifications with no expense spared. Because of its meticulous restoration with the components provided by CJ Pony Parts, this Mach 1 appears brand new as if it just rolled off the assembly line. Even better, only 49,000 miles have accumulated on the clock over its lifetime. Open the doors to reveal an immaculate deluxe interior made of black-knit vinyl and complete with Mach 1 hi-back bucket seats. Also, this car features a radio delete."
