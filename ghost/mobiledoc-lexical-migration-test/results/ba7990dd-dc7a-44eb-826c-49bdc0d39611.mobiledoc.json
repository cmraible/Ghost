Ford says for June 2021 it sold 2,240 Mustangs – that’s the gas-burning kind – versus 4,522 in June of 2020. The difference was a 50.5 percent drop in sales year over year. That certainly seems to fit the narrative that internal combustion engines are on their way out, something you’ve probably seen quite a bit in the news lately."

Keep in mind the EV wasn’t out last June, so there’s no year-over-year comparison. However, so far this year Ford has sold 12,975. Considering the crossover hit dealerships in Q1 that’s not too bad. But if you compare it to the 31,950 ICE Mustangs sold so far this year, that number starts to look a little less impressive. In fact, that begins to tear apart the story that EVs are taking over the market."

We’re willing to bet this was a strategic decision on the part of management since profit margins on the all-electric crossover are likely much fatter. Also, excitement for the Mach-E is high since it just released and Ford knows to capitalize on the launch of any new model line."
