<p>The car <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1965-factory-five-racing-mark-iii-shelby-cobra/?utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">seen here</a> was completed in 2016, and it's powered by a 460 cubic inch V8 hooked up to a Tremec five speed manual transmission. Ford Performance calls this crate engine the Boss, and rates it at an astonishing 575 horsepower.</p>
<p>The silver paint with blue stripes <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1965-factory-five-racing-mark-iii-shelby-cobra/?utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">looks stunning</a>, and it's a nice change from the standard blue and white we're used to seeing on Cobras. We aren't sure about the FR500 Mustang wheels. They look good, but we might prefer something a little more era-appropriate.</p>

<p>This gorgeous blue pickup has been fully restored, right down to the Mercury-exclusive grille, badging, and trim. Besides these small visual details, it's more or less identical to a 1948 Ford pickup we'd find at any car show stateside.</p>
<p>There's a flathead V8 under the hood, a floor-shifted three speed manual, and a wooden bed floor, stained a pretty blue. That's probably our favorite feature.</p>
