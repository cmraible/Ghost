A Heidts front end and a DTS rear end equipped with Wilwood S/S Disc Brakes ensure a modern ride feel and enhanced braking and handling capabilities. Power steering, brakes, seats, windows, and door locks are among the many upgraded features that this car did not originally come with. Under the hood is a 360-horsepower 5.7-liter LS1 EFI engine mated to a 4L60E transmission. Adding a little beauty to the notoriously unsightly engine is a set of custom engine covers and a billet serpentine belt system."
