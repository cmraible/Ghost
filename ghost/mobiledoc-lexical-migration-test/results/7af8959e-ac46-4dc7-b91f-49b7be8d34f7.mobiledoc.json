Which is why I’m currently strapped into a lightweight competition seat by a six-point harness, with flashing instruments in front of me and, perhaps wisely given what those displays are revealing, an FIA-approved roll cage above my head. Of course, that roll cage means Jaguar had to remove the F-type’s folding roof. But thankfully, as would be the norm in February in the United Kingdom, it’s not actually raining. Why a convertible and not a coupe? The XK120 was a roadster, and, well, drivers were made of tougher stuff back in those days."

The wheels are now 16-inches, a fact that sent a ripple of discord through Jaguar’s design office – the last time a Jaguar wore such diminutive alloy wheels was back in the days of the XJS. The suspension hike only serves to diminish the scale of those wheels even further, but high side-walled, Maxport gravel-specification tires help claw back a visual advantage. The suspension these meaty tires hang from uses height-adjustable Eibach competition springs – with spring rates around 40 to 50 percent softer than those of the road car, – as well as EXE-TC dampers with remote reservoirs for higher travel and better thermal protection. The uprated brakes get hot."

Unlike track driving where you can build up a rhythm, there’s little opportunity to do so on a rally stage. It’s a constant push to feel limits that change with every turn, and the variable surface making that process so much more demanding. There are countless small changes required, yet occasionally, there’s the need to be brutal; to provoke the car to turn, be it a big flick of the steering, a pull of that hydraulic handbrake, a sizeable lift off the throttle, or a combination or sequence of all of the above. It’s intense, intoxicating, and hilariously good fun."
