          "First, know that Pontiac only made 943 Firebird and Trans Am Super Duties for the 1974 model year. A mere 212 came with the 455 Super Duty and a manual transmission. This powertrain isn’t just desirable because of its rarity. Each V8 was built by hand and was essentially a race engine. That meant Pontiac had them built off the assembly line, adding to the cost significantly. At a time when automakers were detuning their powerful V8 engines in the face of tight emissions regulations and oil shortages, Pontiac was bucking the trend and catering to enthusiasts."

Same thing goes for the Screaming Chicken on the shaker hood, which is the styling highlight of the car. Other details look excellent, from the badging to the wheels and upholstery. People undoubtedly will admire this handsome muscle machine."

You can blast vintage tunes using the AM/FM 8 track radio. Factory air conditioning and power steering are included, as are power disc brakes. The original tach and gauges are also present, adding to the authentic feel of driving this muscle car."
