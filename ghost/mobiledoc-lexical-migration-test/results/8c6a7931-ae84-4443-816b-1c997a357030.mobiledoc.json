The aim of this fight is to avoid the circular saw. The robot will suddenly drop its saw on either the left or right side and will slide it along the ground, so your job is to jump over it. The trick to figuring out which side the robot is going to drop its saw is by watching its eyes. Either the left or right robot will duck its head for a second, almost as if it&#8217;s winking at you.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4706\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Pikuniku Walkthrough Forest\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?w=2880&amp;ssl=1 2880w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?resize=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?resize=1300%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-14-at-4.51.25-pm.png?w=2700&amp;ssl=1 2700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>After avoiding the saw twice, kick the explosive pinecone that the rebel on the right throws down to you.
