<p>Straight off the factory line, the <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/4234-dfw/2005-ford-gt-twin-turbo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Ford GT</a> became an instant collectible. <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/4234-dfw/2005-ford-gt-twin-turbo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The car world was gifted</a> the GT40 design, with a modern engine, sporty suspension, and benefits of modern luxuries. People were suddenly able to get pretty darn close to experiencing what famous Le Mans drivers got to back in the 1960's, and this time with a full interior and air conditioning. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/4234-dfw/2005-ford-gt-twin-turbo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The 2005 Ford GT</a> cars all came with supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engines, but this particular example is an insane build, with even more power than what a blown 5.4-liter produces. This car has undergone a 840-horsepower, twin turbo conversion that totaled out at over $60K - making this black-on-black, twin-turbocharged monster one of the most sinister beasts on the market. </p>

<p>The custom works include twin Garrett GT35-R dual-ball bearing turbos, an Accufab monoblade throttle blade, a custom aluminum intake manifold, and a full stainless exhaust from the turbos on back – all of which were installed and tuned perfectly by the pros at Underground Racing in Charlotte, NC. Backing the engine is a six-speed Ricardo manual transmission. While it has a radical powertrain, there's only 4,237 miles on the odometer, so this GT has lived a fairly careful life. <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/4234-dfw/2005-ford-gt-twin-turbo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">See it here.</a></p>
