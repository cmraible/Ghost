The thought of riding in the cab of towing a farm truck with our friends and family or even just learning how to drive in a smaller pick-up fills our hearts with tears even now. Classic trucks in particular are something really special. They bring the classic Chevy, Dodge, or Ford styling together with respectable performance and decent rigidity. However, these are not exactly ideal work trucks. Modern times have brought forth an era of millions of hungry mouths to feed with only a few farms supplying the united states within our borders. So what if you want something that will bring that head-turning aesthetic to the table without compromising utility?",

They had to be better, this was a time of all-out war in the automotive world. You had the greats like Carroll Shelby supping up the Mustangs to dominate the streets. All the while legendary designers such as Lee Iacocca were busy creating cars like the Chargers and other Chrysler performance cars.
