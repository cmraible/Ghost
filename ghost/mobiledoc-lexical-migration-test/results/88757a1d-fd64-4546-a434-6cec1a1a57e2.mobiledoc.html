<p>A red <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/chevrolet/corvette">2016 Chevy Corvette Stingray</a> was stolen near Ellisville, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mercury-cougar-mississippi-river/">Mississippi</a> on the night of May 19 and law enforcement is asking for the public’s help finding it. According to the Jones County Sheriff’s Department, the sports car has a Mississippi NASCAR #3 tag P413, although we doubt the thieves have left that on.</p>

<p>While it’s been a while and we don’t see an update on this car, we don’t think it’s time to give up hope. A lot of people are going to say it’s chopped up into many pieces or on a boat on the other side of the world by now, but that’s not always the case. Sometimes stolen cars are kept and joyridden locally for months or years afterward.</p>
<p>Car theft continues to be a problem both in cities and more rural communities. It’s not uncommon for thieves from metropolitan areas to branch out into less populated cities and towns as a way to let the heat die down in their usual hunting grounds. In other words, no matter where you live you need to always take steps to secure your ride.</p>
<p>One of the best things you can do is lock your car up overnight. This means no only putting it in a garage or some other secure facility, but also locking the doors when you do. We’re constantly amazed at how many people believe their garage is a fortress and so don’t bother locking their car doors while parked inside.</p>
<p>It’s also a great idea to get security cameras and even an alarm for your garage. Installing an alarm or extra security features on your car is another good move. You should give serious consideration to using at least one GPS device in your ride, too.</p>
<p>The Jones County Sheriff’s Department is asking that anyone who has information about this stolen 2016 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray call them at 601-425-3147 or Jones County Crime Stoppers at 601-428-STOP (7867).</p>
