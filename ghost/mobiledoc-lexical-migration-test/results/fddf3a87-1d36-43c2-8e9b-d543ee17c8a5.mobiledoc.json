One of the lightweight, low-drag versions, it was created along with its very limited stable of siblings to take on Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. For many avid collectors, this car is on their dream list, especially since they rarely are listed for sale."

Despite allowing the car to slip through the air with less resistance, in 1963 it was set aside as a more lightweight version of the racer was developed. Those 12 cars wore handcrafted aluminum bodies which were also quite aerodynamic."

On shorter tracks they were able to overtake the Ferrari GTOs, however on circuits with longer straightaways they couldn’t keep up. That meant endurance competitions like the 24 Hours of Le Mans were still owned by Enzo Ferrari and his team."
