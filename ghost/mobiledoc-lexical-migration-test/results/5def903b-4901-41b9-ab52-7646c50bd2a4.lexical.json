You can see in the shots of the Pierce-Arrow driving around that it has the white stuff all over it. Not only can that provide a little bit of wind resistance, it’s corrosive and can fly off the body onto the driver, the instruments, steering wheel, etc. so getting rid of it during pit stops is a good idea.
