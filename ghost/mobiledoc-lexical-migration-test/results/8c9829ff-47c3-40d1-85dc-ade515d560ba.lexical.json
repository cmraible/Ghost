Sure, the Tremec 7-speed dual-clutch transmission provides lightning-quick shifts and can carry a lot of power, but at what cost? Farah somewhat jokingly points out it allows for more cupholder space in the center console. That’s a small consolation for what you might consider a huge loss.

That’s not necessarily something muscle car fans will think is good. After all, a muscle car shouldn’t feel like a European sport coupe, but that’s what Farah says it mimics. For him, not just having a bunch of power is what matters but getting that power down is where it really counts, which is what Porsches and other Euro models have perfected.
