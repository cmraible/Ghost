The interior has been reupholstered in blue vinyl and all gauges, switches, and controls work as they should. Under the hood is the original 350-cid engine that has been rebuilt and upgraded with a serpentine-belt system. A stainless steel exhaust and a new clutch were also added. From the stock 4-speed manual transmission back, the rest of the drivetrain is stock. Other modifications include the professional installation of a sunroof and aftermarket wheels but the cut out roof section and the stock wheels will accompany the sale.
