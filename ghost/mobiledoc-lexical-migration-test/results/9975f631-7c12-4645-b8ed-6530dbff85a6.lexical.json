It was the fuel and tire rationing during WWII which was enforced by a national speed limit of 35 mph that originally got him thinking of how to help people maintain a constant speed over long distances. In the early days, the “Speedostat” (Ralph hated the name “cruise control” as suggested by Cadillac later) featured a dashboard-mounted speed selector. Once the vehicle achieved the selected speed, a governor overcame spring tension to actuate a vacuum-driven piston, which in turn would push against the gas pedal. The patent for this amazing invention was filed in 1945, but it wasn’t until the oil crisis of the 1970s that it really caught on. With a national speed limit put in place to help conserve fuel and law enforcement vigorously enforcing it, people clamored for the device which would keep them out of trouble.",
