You probably don’t know – I didn’t – that Roboze is a 3D printing company the Italian motorsports division has been working with for over a year. It helps quickly craft components for motorcycles using super polymers and composite materials, both for prototyping and finished products. This got me thinking about where the state of 3D printing in the motorcycle industry is at this point. After all, it seemed all the rage a few years ago, but you don’t hear nearly as much about it lately.",

The BMW Motorrad iParts program was to be rolled out to 250 dealers worldwide. Each one was to get a large printer for use in the shop, allowing the printing of big, complex components. Even more interesting was the revealing of a small 3D printer which could be transported by motorcycle to remote customers for producing smaller, less complex components on the spot. What many didn’t realize until later was that the press release came out on April 1, so yes it was a joke. Still, some people got really excited about the possibilities, only to feel like their hopes had been weaponized against them. Did this hurt the image of 3D printing in the industry?

Because the electric motor doesn’t generate as much heat as an internal combustion engine, additive manufacturing using polymers which don’t have the heat resistance of certain metals was possible. That in turn helps with lightweighting. Of course, the lithium-ion battery cells aren’t exactly light, so the goal is to balance that out if not achieve a net loss in the motorcycle’s weight. However, like so much of the 3D printing excitement in the motorcycle niche, the Nera premiered in 2018.",
