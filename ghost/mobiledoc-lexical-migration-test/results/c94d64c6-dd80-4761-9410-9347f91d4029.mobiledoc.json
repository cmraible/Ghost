Its name derived from the seven times Jaguar has won the famous Le Mans 24-hour race. Three of those historic wins were in the iconic D‑type, and the brief to Jaguar’s designers with the Project 7 was to conceive a modern-day D‑type. Harry was involved in the car from its formative days, providing feedback on the first prototype vehicles. Harry’s car is number 1 of 250, and as such has a few special features including the striking orange detailing on the front grille, calipers, mirrors and the underside of the rear spoiler.

Bikes that visitors can expect to see on the stand include a 1978 Yamaha XT500, a 1984 BMW R80 G/S Paris Dakar, a Honda XL500R Paris Dakar, a 1989 Honda Africa Twin 650 Marathon, a 1989 Yamaha Super Tenere 750 and a 1991 Cagiva Elefant 900ie – which all help to chronicle the legendary off-road rally event which started out in 1978 pitting competitors against each other on the toughest off-road terrain from Paris France to Dakar, Senegal. He is also bringing along two of his favourite road bikes, a 1974 Kawasaki KH750 (the biggest two-stroke production superbike), which has a fearsome reputation and was banned in the US in 1976 for breaching emissions regulations, and a 1979 Honda CBX which is well-known for being the first ever six-cylinder production bike."
