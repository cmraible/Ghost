However, we happen to know the real purpose of all this technology is to see car collections you would never have access to, just like what barn find expert Dennis Collins has so graciously provided recently. In the video included with this article, you’ll get virtual access to an amazing American muscle car collection which is hidden away from prying eyes."

Mixed in with the muscle cars are plenty of Corvettes and a Ford GT, making the collection all the better. The facility is like one giant man cave with memorabilia, a kitchen, and even a Camaro pool table."

While we understand that, we’ve seen people treat others’ rides at shows with less than respect so many times, it’s easy to see why one would begin to not trust most to be around something this awesome. After all, the cars in the collection wouldn’t be in nearly as good of shape, what with all the scratches, missing shifter knobs, and other sheer disrespect that would undoubtedly be paid to them."
