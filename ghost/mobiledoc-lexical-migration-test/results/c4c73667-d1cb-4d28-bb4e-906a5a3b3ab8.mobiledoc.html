<p>Who are <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a>? They are the paper that got <a href="http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/">the Panama Papers</a>.</p>
<p>Their subscription model has now surpassed the ad model – he’s happy, because he doesn’t think that the ad model is sustainable.</p>
<p>Paid content is a politicised discussion in Germany. However, their adoption of a paywall is not a political statement – it’s just what they <em>need</em> to do. They have a <em>great</em> growth curve – which he shared with us (including figures), but which he didn’t want shared.</p>
<p>Their paid content model is an agile paywall for SZ Plus. Basic news is free. It’s a commodity. You get 10 bylined articles from staff per week for free. Beyond that, there’s a premium paywall – subscriber-only content – and once you’re subscriber you get the epaper edition, too. It’s complicated, but they don’t need to explain it to the readers – because it just works.</p>
<p>All in subscription for €34.99.</p>

<p>They’re in a tower block with (relatively) small floors, so they have to be really creative with setting.</p>
<p>For example, the social media, homepage and managing editors sit adjacent to each other. They have a Textmarketing expert – but what does she do? She identifies the probably bestsellers in the articles they publish – and then she promotes them big time, on every channel that is possible and reasonable.</p>
<p>An agile editorial model:</p>

<p>They’re constantly surprised by what stories create subscriptions – this model allows them to continue doing that. They’ve torn down the wall between editorial and publishing (but not ads), to make sure everyone is working together to generate subscriptions.</p>
<p>They drive conversions with premium, evergreen content, with social sharing and with rebundling content around key dates or events.</p>
