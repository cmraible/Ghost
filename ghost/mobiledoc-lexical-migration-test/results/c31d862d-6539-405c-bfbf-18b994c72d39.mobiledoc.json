Vehicles and a large crowd were blocking traffic lanes, making it difficult for police officers to get to the event and break it up. This sort of tactic is used by street takeover people all the time. And of course law enforcement didn’t make any arrests, which just emboldens these kids further."

Not only can they keep people from getting where they need to be, bystanders get hurt at them all the time, plus they’re magnets for all kinds of other illegal activities. Many of the cars used in them are stolen, and as this case shows others aren’t stolen but are using stolen parts. This is why we as enthusiasts need to do all we can to condemn these gatherings as something toxic and absolutely not a part of car culture."
