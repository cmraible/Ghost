<hr>
<p>When Ford unveiled the Mustang on April 17, 1964, the new car caused a sensation. It would go on to <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31318/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-rs-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">pace the Indianapolis 500</a> just a month and a half later.</p>
<p>Chevrolet worked fast to create their Mustang competitor, <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31318/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-rs-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the Camaro</a>. When the Camaro bowed for 1967, it, too, would pace the Great American Race.</p>

<p>While most folks are familiar with the white and orange 1969 Camaro pace cars, the <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31318/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-rs-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">white and blue 1967 cars</a> are less well known. That might have something to do with the fact that only about 200 pace car replicas were produced for 1967.</p>
<p>Of those, just a few were big block cars, like <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31318/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-rs-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the example seen here</a>. This Camaro left the factory with a 396 cubic inch big block V8 and a four speed manual transmission.</p>

<p>That would be a desirable combination even without the pace car pedigree. Incredibly, both the engine and transmission are numbers matching originals – they've <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31318/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-rs-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">stayed with the car</a> this entire time.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31318/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-rs-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the auction listing</a>, this car has been documented and verified. The floorpans are original and have never been replaced, although the car was restored sometime in the 1990s. The 86,000 miles on the odometer are believed to be original.</p>
