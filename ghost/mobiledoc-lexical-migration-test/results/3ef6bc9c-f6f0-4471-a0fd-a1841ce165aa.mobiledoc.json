At first, the movement is fairly sluggish and does not feel great, but as the player progresses through stages, more and more upgrade options become available. These upgrades include having more water capacity, obtaining more money after each successful mission, getting a faster ax, getting a cute dog to pet in between every outing and more. Getting more powerful is addicting and there’s a very clear turning point where the Firegirl becomes a powerful one-woman fire-fighting force. It is exciting to get more and more money in order to buy more upgrades and the game delivers throughout the whole process."
