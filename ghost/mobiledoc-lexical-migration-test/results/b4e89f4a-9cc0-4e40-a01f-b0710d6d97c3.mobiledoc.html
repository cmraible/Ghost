<p>Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the key battleground states that could decide the presidential election. That is why — as a yesterday’s Daily Poster report detailed —  Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been trying to change election laws in ways that critics say could suppress turnout and deter voters from going to the polls. Meanwhile, Republican operatives have reportedly been exploring ways to use the GOP’s control of the state legislature to shift Pennsylvania’s Electoral College electors to Trump.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro has been in court against the Trump campaign and against the U.S. Postal Service to try to protect voters’ rights. In an interview with <em>The Daily Poster</em>, he says that he believes Trump is actively trying “to make it harder for people to vote in our democracy” — and he discussed what his office is doing to try to fight back.</p>
<p>He also talked about the state of the 2020 race, and what Democrats have to do to win back states like Pennsylvania.</p>
