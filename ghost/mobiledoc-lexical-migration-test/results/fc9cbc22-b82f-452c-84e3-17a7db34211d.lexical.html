<p>Sad news for the engaged journalism community, as the annual migration to Italy is cancelled. I <em>actually</em> had my ducks in a row to attend this year – so of course this happens. Of course. </p>

<p>This, in common with many of the exposés of life as a content moderator, is not an easy read. Don't do it when tired, or feeling down.</p>
<p>The underlying question remains unanswered: how do we stop these sharing platforms amplifying the worst aspects of humanity?</p>

<p>The <em>Bristol Post</em> made the decision to name and shame aggressive commentators who made threats and other abusive comments after Greta Thunberg's appearance in the city. This has received almost unanimous praise, but I am less confident that they did exactly the right thing. I'll dive deeper into that in a members-only post later this week. </p>

<p>Not quite sure where Facebook is going with this app. Right now, it's a more user friendly front end on the Page Insights. Worth sticking on your phone, though, to see if they add the content creation features that the name implies. </p>

<p>The combination of LinkedIn and Stories is guaranteed to bring out the snark in the Twitter bubble, and so it was. However, this is worth watching.

<p>This is going to be handy for both live event coverage, and as a way of driving traffic to older stories, but appending to well-shared older Tweets. Plenty of opportunity for creative experimentation here, too. </p>
