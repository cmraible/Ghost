Richard Rawlings is one of those people who is just drawn to these cars for one reason or another. Luckily he recently uncovered a massive treasure of cars, one of which perfectly embodies the best examples of that generation ever made. Somehow, the automobiles wound up inside a trailer full of muscle cars and eventually made their way onto the set of "

Before actually striking the deal in reference to the Camaro, the legend decided to pick up a nice 1994 Chevrolet Silverado. If you've ever owned a sports car then you'll know how big of an asset a pickup truck can be, plus that generation of Silverado can be very iconic.

It could be a racing vehicle that relies heavily on performance above all or it could simply be the sort of car you take to the canyons.
