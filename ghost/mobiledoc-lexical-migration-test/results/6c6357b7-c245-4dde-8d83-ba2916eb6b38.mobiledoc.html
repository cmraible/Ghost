<p>Finished in a glossy black, this GT-R appears as sinister as it performs. Exterior highlights on the Black Edition include a carbon fiber spoiler out back and exclusive 20-inch RAYS wheels. Keeping the black theme uniform are tinted windows but also allow privacy.</p>
<p>Powering the sports car is a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 engine shifted via an automatic transmission. A GruppeM (designed with K&N) Carbon Fiber Ram Air intake system increases power and torque and improves throttle response. Even more, it features a clean carbon fiber casing.</p>
<p>Open the doors to the cabin and reveal an immaculate interior that shows some of the exclusive features of a Black Edition. Recaro racing seats that were commissioned specifically by Nissan for the Black Edition are bolted down up front, and the interior is finished in red and black leather.</p>
