As stated by the current owner on the for sale ad - \"Don't shoot the messenger.\" While purists may be cringing inside, he did this so he could easily get in and out and drive off since it is tricky to set up the triple carburetors in sequence and have them stay that way. Also, the last owner added an MSD distributor. But don't worry, all three original carburetors and the original distributor are all included with the sale of the car so it could easily be reversed back to its true all-original 6-pack form. All cringing purists should now be relieved. Also, a 4-speed manual transmission with pistol grip twists a Dana 60 rear axle stuffed with 3.54 gears."
