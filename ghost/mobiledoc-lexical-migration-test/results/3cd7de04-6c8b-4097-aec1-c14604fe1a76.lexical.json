In the case of three car photographers from Cleveland, they were approached with a golden opportunity to document the rally and take pictures of the cars. This was a dream come true for the photographers at the time and an incredible opportunity to boost their experience. However something was wrong about this particular rally, something ",

The curator made the additional promise of the presence of a Porsche 918, this excited the boys who were set to shoot the rally. Finally, after arriving almost an hour late, our culprit showed up in a red Durango. He passed around some wavers and began collecting driver's licenses.
