<p>Manny Khoshbin has a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">car</a> collection which makes quite a few enthusiasts as well as regular people drool. Among his collection are five <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>SLR <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mclaren">McLarens</a>, a Porsche 935, a Porsche Carrera GT, a McLaren Senna, three <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Bugatti">Bugattis</a> (one Chiron and two Veyrons), and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mclaren/650S">McLaren 650S</a>. Yes, the guy is into exotics (and his garage is nicer than a lot of people’s homes). He claims to have never added up his annual maintenance costs before, which is most definitely not true, since except in rare cases you don’t accumulate such wealth by accident. Anyway, the full amount is a number which will make you cringe.</p>

<p>Just for his Mercedes-Benz SLR McLarens, annual maintenance is a whopping $35,000. An oil change on the Porsche Carrera GT is $1,500. It goes on, but if you want the complete details you’ll have to watch the video. To cut to the chase, just basic maintenance each year runs him about $115,000. That’s not including tires, which you could really go through if you drive these machines aggressively, and let’s be honest that’s part of the point of owning such things.</p>
<p>So he’s spending more each year just to keep his cars running than most people make. That’s insane. Also, if this video comes across as the guy bragging, that’s because he is. After all, he’s wearing a hoodie which reads “Great Success” repeatedly across the back, so he’s not exactly shy.</p>
<p>If Khoshbin looks familiar, it’s because you might have seen him on the Netflix series Fastest Car, where he used his McLaren 650S in season two.</p>
<p>Of course, how much your car collection costs to maintain will be different if you have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet">Chevrolets</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Dodge">Dodges</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford">Fords</a>, or other less-exotic vehicles than Khoshbin. But this just goes to show that not only do you need to financial might to acquire such cars, you also must have plenty of cash to keep them running properly.</p>
