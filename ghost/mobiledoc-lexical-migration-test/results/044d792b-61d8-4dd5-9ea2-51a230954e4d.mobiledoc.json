The 2002 pickup is based on the 10th generation for the F-Series Ford trucks, but it got a special supercharged 5.4-liter that helped it lay down 380-horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque from the factory. This example has been modified to reach 450-horsepower and over 480 lbs of torque. Backing the engine is a four-speed automatic transmission that feeds power to the rear tires, and it rides on a custom suspension to keep it grounded."

Dodge produced this model to essentially be a Viper stuffed inside the body of a full-size pickup truck. With an 8.3-liter V10 engine under the hood, 500-horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque was sent to the rear tires. According to the ad, “This truck was placed in the Guinness World Records for being the Fastest Production Truck Produced with a top speed of 154.4 MPH in its stock condition.”"
