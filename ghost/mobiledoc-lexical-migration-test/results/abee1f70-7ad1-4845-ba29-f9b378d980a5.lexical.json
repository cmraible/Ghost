But we are seeing a global movement for change that is emerging. We see it in lawmakers facing more and more pressure to act. We see it in the divestment movement. We saw it most recently in Washington this week, when hundreds of staff in the Biden administration and on Capitol Hill publicly blew the whistle, demanding that Democrats who control the federal government stop surrendering on climate action.",
