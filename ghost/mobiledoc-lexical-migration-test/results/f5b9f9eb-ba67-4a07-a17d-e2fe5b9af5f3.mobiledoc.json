Maybe this final Last Call model will be truly spectacular, the true sendoff the Charger and Challenger deserve right before they’re turned into crossovers with straight sixes. However, all this hype makes me skeptical. After all, if the car is really as good as we’re being primed to believe, it wouldn’t need all this hype. Hopefully it is spectacular."
