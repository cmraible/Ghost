<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Many of you already received an email about this new newsletter I’m launching. So, as a quick follow up, I just wanted to thank everyone for <a href="#/portal/signup">subscribing</a> and for the tremendous outpouring of support for the project — and I wanted to let you know I’ll have the first dispatch done soon.</p>
<p><strong>For those who are learning about this newsletter for the first time — <a href="/subscribe-to-tmi-dispatches-from"><strong>click here</strong></a> for a review of what it will be all about, and then consider <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>clicking here to pitch in</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>You can also do nothing and remain as a subscriber to the free version.</p>
<p>And if you want to unsubscribe, just go to the bottom of this email and do that.</p>
<p>Thanks — and hope you are staying safe and healthy in these frightening times.</p>
<p>More soon,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
