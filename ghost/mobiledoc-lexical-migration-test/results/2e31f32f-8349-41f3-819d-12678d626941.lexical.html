It's also, in some ways, yet another form of Trump-era chaos.”</em></p>

Why Won’t They Use It?</strong></a></strong>(Eudaimonia) —<em> The Democratic party has won real power in Washington, but rather than wielding it, is calling for unity and healing. “Passing a bunch of Executive Orders to reverse a few of Trump’s abuses of power isn’t governing like you have a mandate. It’s just the lowest possible bar for reversing authoritarianism,” Umair Haque writes.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://prospect.org/power/what-weve-learned-from-the-robinhood-affair/"><strong>What We’ve Learned From the Robinhood Affair</strong></a></strong> (The American Prospect) — <em>Former Senator and leader of the Biden transition Ted Kaufman tried to crack down on predatory short-selling over a decade ago, but nobody listened to him. He doesn’t have an official role in the Biden administration, but his track record on financial regulation shows that Biden should be listening to his longtime aide.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/tech-labor-progressive/"><strong>These Machines Won’t Kill Fascism</strong></a></strong> (The Nation) — <em>“If progressives are to ensure that technical systems aren’t yoked to a far-right agenda, they’ll need to stop relying on legislative maneuvering or entreaties to corporations and, together with these frontline actors globally, vie for control over the infrastructure itself.”</em></p>

But the information that is public about those agreements shows that governments made a huge investment in vaccine development, and are still paying high prices and are not sharing intellectual property rights with the companies whose names are attached to the vaccines.</em></p>

As a result, only a tiny percentage of climate legislation ever reached a vote––and activists fear this lobbying will continue to block action on climate.</em></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota-"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As you can tell, we have devoted substantial reporting resources to the battle over survival checks, and it’s a decision we are proud of. Lots of media look for clickbait, but this is the opposite of a clickbait story — it is a deep and important story of details and economic hardship.</p>
<p>Put another way: it is exactly the kind of story we started <em>The Daily Poster</em> to cover, because billionaire- and corporate-owned media is not that interested in covering it.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a long investigative project about the early years of the Obama administration, and so I am immersed in the details of how that White House squandered an opportunity to rebuild our economy. While I am under no illusions about the Biden administration, I was heartened this week to see at least some top White House officials rhetorically signal that they understand the danger of once again missing the opportunity to go big.</p>
<p>There is almost always a difference between rhetoric and action, and that’s what we will continue to cover in this debate over the stimulus bill. That is something of a risk for us — our coverage of the Biden administration has has resulted in us losing some subscribers who only want us to scrutinize Republicans.</p>
<p>But that’s the thing: we are not a platform for party propaganda. We follow the money wherever it leads, and that means we end up doing hard-hitting coverage of politicians of <em>both</em> political parties.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful we can continue building a news outlet with a subscriber base that supports that work. The initial signs tell me that there is indeed a large audience for that kind of coverage — and that is what we will continue to provide, even if partisans don’t like that.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the team — and for supporting this work.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
