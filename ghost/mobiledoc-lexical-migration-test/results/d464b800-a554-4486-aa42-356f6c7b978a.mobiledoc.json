But the ’64 Studebaker Commander was limited in production to fewer than 2,000 units, making them rare and not as much of a known quantity for many. Definitely the dark horse in this race, the Studebaker is either going to unsurprisingly be slaughtered by the Chevy or pull off an amazing upset."

Mated to that is a 4-speed manual transmission. A set of 3.73 rear gears help put power to the ground. Before Chevy fans start getting smug, the Camaro Z28 weighs 3,906 lbs., making it pretty heavy."

That difference in how power output is measured for the two cars makes the on-paper comparison a little bit trickier. Moving on, the Studebaker uses a 4-speed manual transmission, just like the Chevy, so both drivers need to be skilled at rowing through the gears and managing the clutch properly. Around back are 4.56 gears. However, this car tips the scale at just 3,584 lbs."
