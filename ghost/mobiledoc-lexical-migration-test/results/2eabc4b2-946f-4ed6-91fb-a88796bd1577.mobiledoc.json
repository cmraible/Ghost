A witness told one local reporter the Mercedes and Lamborghini “going by it just sounded like people yeah racing.” However, a Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said he wasn’t able to confirm if the two driver were racing each other. He also emphasized that charges would be coming, stating “what our roadways are not… are racetracks.”"
