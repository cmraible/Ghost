<p>As part of the exclusive content we offer to supporting subscribers, I am going to periodically publish some podcast interviews Iâ€™ve done that still remain relevant today. This is the first.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, I talked to author Thomas Frank about how the Democratic Party had lost so much power over the previous decade. Though some of the topics are a bit outdated, the overall themes are a constant. Frank has a new book out today that updates much of what he was reporting on back then. It is called <em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250220110">The People, No: A Brief History of Anti-Populism</a></em>. Listen to this podcast and then check it out.</p>
