<div>In many ways, I think Shaneâ€™s [following post](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/shane_richmond/blog/2008/07/23/suddenly_everybodys_buying_blogs) hits the nail more accurately on the head:</div>
<div></div>> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">This seems to be a change in direction for a blogosphere. Instead of bloggers trying to reach the elite on their own, they are now selling into bigger entities, bringing their audience and hoping to gain from being part of a larger whole.</span>
<div>This is a win-winÂ equationÂ much of the time. When we broughtÂ [Flightblogger](http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/flightblogger/)Â into the Flight Global stable, we gained the traffic and skills of a great blogger, and he gained the resources and brand name of a long-established publisher to back him up. And more to the point, we gained a great example of just how powerful, how journalistic and how traffic-generating great MSM-backed blogging can be.Â </div>
<div></div>
<div>I really hope that in the coming months weâ€™ll finally see the blogging versus journalism meme die, and weâ€™ll start to see the true fruits of the great symbiosis between a profession and a style of publishing that the meeting of the two entails.</div>

<div>Time to get some work done. ðŸ™‚</div><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
