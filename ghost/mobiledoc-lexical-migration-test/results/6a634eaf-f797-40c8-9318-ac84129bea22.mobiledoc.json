          " year marked the 25th anniversary of the Chevrolet Corvette. To celebrate this important milestone, General Motors completely redesigned the body with new fastback styling. With the redesign, the American automaker also debuted a unique Anniversary Edition and a limited-edition replica of its Indy 500 pace car. The Anniversary edition cost an extra $399 for the special two-tone paint job, but it wasn't a limited model by any means with 15,283 sold. However, the pace car replica was limited to just one per Chevrolet dealership which equaled out to 6,502 units, and they were available for an additional $13,000 over the price of the car."
