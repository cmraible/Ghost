Those surveyed were pulled from 9 different US Census Regions. A total of 1,172 brands were included for evaluation by these people. An admitted fault with this method is plenty of people won’t want to go through that many brands, and there’s the possibility that partway through participants were just filling in whatever because they were getting bored or had something else to do. In other words, we wouldn’t take this result as gospel truth, but it is interesting that Jeep landed on the top."
