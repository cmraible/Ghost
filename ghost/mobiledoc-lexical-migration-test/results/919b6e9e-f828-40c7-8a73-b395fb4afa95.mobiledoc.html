<p>Indiana Department of Natural Resources conservation officers in made a shocking, accidental discovery while doing a training exercise recently. The routine event held at the White River resulted in the team marking what they believed to be multiple sunken cars in the river. On November 3, a dive team finally removed the vehicles.</p>

<p>In total, 5 cars were submerged in that section of the White River. Authorities say all of them were reported stolen back in 2008. We know what everyone’s mind goes to immediately when they see something like this: climate change. That’s right, if water levels were higher these vehicles might never have been discovered.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, a lot of people will jump to the conclusion this was insurance fraud. That’s certainly a possibility, but it’s also possible thieves stole the cars to commit other crimes, returning to same place to dump them to get rid of evidence. In the end, we don’t know but we’d imagine authorities might want to check out both possibilities.</p>
<p>The police departments which took the original stolen vehicle reports will be contacted about the discoveries, as will the insurance companies. From there, the insurers can decide what they want to do with these vehicles, like the vintage Hyundai left underwater for over a decade. Call it a hunch, but we think scrap metal is about all these cars are good for at this point.</p>

<p>We guess this is a good time to talk about the importance of not hiding unwanted vehicles in rivers. After all, it pollutes and sure looks difficult to remove afterward. Also, you might want to take extra precautions to secure your car. And don’t commit insurance fraud since we all end up paying for that. Also, we have yet to see any stories about collectable Hyundais, so that wasn’t a huge loss, although who knows what the future might bring?</p>
