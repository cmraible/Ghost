<p><a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/1681/1988-ford-mustang-gt-convertible">The Ford Mustang Foxbody</a> has long been considered one of America’s favorite pony car platforms for many reasons. Whether you like it because it was fast for the time, easy to work on, or simply for its good looks, there's pretty much something for everyone to enjoy. The late 1980s were a particularly popular time for the platform making cars like this one stand out as legends of a time when performance was hard to come by. Luckily that's something you won't have to miss out on with this Mustang as you’ll soon see by simply looking into the engine bay.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/1681/1988-ford-mustang-gt-convertible">Under the hood</a> is an engine we still regard today as one of the best to ever see the Ford production line. That's right, you know exactly what we're talking about, the 5.0 which uses its low displacement and small-block configuration to make a ton of power. The power is sent through a five-speed transmission dubbed the T5 which has been regarded as one of Ford’s best performance gearboxes. On top of that, you also get a manual configuration which is perfect for this power level and weight. This is because the car is easily controlled and better handled by a manual transmission through corners and straights while also providing the driver with an engaging driving experience. Overall, this is the perfect ‘80s performance combination and would fit nicely in your automotive collection, that is if you can get to it before somebody else does.</p>
