Back in 1983 he was looking through Auto Trader (not the website, kiddies, because that didn’t exist back then) and saw a listing that said “1968 GT500 needs TLC $5,500.” When he went to look at the car it was a mess with cracked paint, plus problems with the engine and drivetrain. In fact, to take the Shelby for a test drive, Miguel had to help the owner replace both rear axles."

No doubt people paid plenty of notice to it by then. That Wimbledon White paint and blue graphics look pristine, as does everything else about this ride. Instead of just letting it sit in the garage, Miguel says he takes it for a drive twice a month, which is fantastic."

That legendary status combined with the rarity of these early Shelby Mustangs makes a well-sorted example like this one a real treat to see. We’re glad Miguel took the time to share his car with everyone. If you enjoyed it, consider voting for this Shelby GT500 "
