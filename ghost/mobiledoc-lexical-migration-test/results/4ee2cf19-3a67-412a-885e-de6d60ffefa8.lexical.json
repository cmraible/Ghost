            "text": "The Dodge Hellcat is probably the most popular performance trim model within the American domestic performance market for its incredible speed, performance, and power options. Of course, much can be said about the ridiculous Charger, Challenger, and Durango Hellcats. Still, engine swapping is an aspect of the Hellcat community that is quickly gaining traction among enthusiasts. It would appear that the Hellcat V8 and other Dodge V8’s are poised to take the throne that was previously held by the LS platform for being the all-purpose engine of choice for performance builds. This truck perfectly exemplifies that as it boasts a ton of horsepower from a Hellcat V8 in the body of one of America’s favorite small truck platforms.",

Of course, that would be the famous 6.2-liter supercharged Hellcat V8 engine which puts out over 707 horsepower for this incredibly light pickup truck. Funny enough, this vehicle came stock slightly more delicate than the original Hellcat Charger, which served as the donor for this build. That means that the truck can utilize its horsepower even better than a stock hellcat, all while showing off some excellent exterior styling and interior craftsmanship.",

Finally, it was time for a test drive, which proved exciting for the driver as he broke traction multiple times and generally had a ton of fun with his new hot rod truck. We respect builds like this one that take crazy risks to gain some more performance, and we hope to see more like it in the future.",
