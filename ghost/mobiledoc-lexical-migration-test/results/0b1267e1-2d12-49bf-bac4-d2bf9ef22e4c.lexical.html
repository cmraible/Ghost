<p>Licensing the name and logo from GM, Trans Am Depot picked up where GM left off. The company, along with the help of the Bandit himself, took 77 2015 Chevrolet Camaros and turned them into modern <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/special-edition-c3-corvette/">editions</a> of the 77 Trans Am featured in the Movie - T-Tops and all.</p>

<p>As seen in the pictures on the site, this car seems to be well taken care of and only has 2,500 miles on the clock. The build is well documented and comes with a certificate of origin and a custom document folder, along with a custom embroidered car cover, bandit driving gloves, and embroidered polo shirt.</p>

<p>Trans Am Depot has not only captured the essence of the Bandit Trans Am with the ultimate bring back, but added so much more to it. While this is a highly collectable car, it was made to be driven and we can only hope to see it screaming down the road someday soon.</p>
