<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Today, <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> accountability journalism is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/01/trailer-what-biden-left-are-demanding-each-other/">featured</a> in the Washington Post, because we were the only media outlet willing to report on Biden’s budget nominee pushing Social Security cuts.</p>
<p>Our reporting on Biden nominees’ corporate ties have gone viral and made a lot of powerful people in Washington angry — and they want to silence us - but we’re not going away. We’re going to expand - if you’re willing to help.</p>
<p><strong>We are grassroots-funded - so here’s the ask: PLEASE <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to become a supporting subscriber right now.</strong></a> Don’t put it off, don’t wait - help us expand our impact RIGHT NOW.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>Now for some big news: Starting tomorrow, we are launching the Midday Poster exclusively for supporting subscribers.</p>
<p>It will be a succinct rundown of important scoops, tidbits and must-reads. Supporting subscribers already get exclusive access to our live events and to our Weekend Reader — the Midday Poster is designed with brevity in mind so that if you can only read one thing in a day, you’ll want it to be that. Think of it as Politico Playbook, except for normal people, not corporate lobbyists.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, you’ve seen the impact our journalism is having — as a grassroots-funded media outlet, we’ve broken stories that the corporate media will not touch. We don’t care if our reporting makes powerful people angry — we hold power accountable, no matter who it annoys.</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>We are aiming to hire more reporters to expand our journalism — so please: click here to become a supporting subscriber today.</strong></a></p>
<p>One other note: Next week, we are adjusting our monthly pricing to $8-a-month or $75-a-year in order to help us raise more resources to expand. Until then, you can still subscribe at the $5-a-month or $50-a-year rates for the next week. So if you’ve been thinking about subscribing, you may want to do it now.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request — we hope you’ll become part of <em>The Daily Poster</em> team and help fund our accountability journalism.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
