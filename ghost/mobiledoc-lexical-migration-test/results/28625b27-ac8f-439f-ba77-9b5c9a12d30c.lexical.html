<h3 id="dream-giveaways-grand-prize-package-consists-of-two-paint-matching-camarosa-one-of-a-kind-restomod-and-a-modern-track-dominator">Dream Giveaway's grand prize package consists of two paint-matching Camaros - a one-of-a-kind restomod and a modern track dominator.</h3>
<hr>
<p>One car that dominated the street back in the golden days would be <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro</a>. A force to be reckoned with from the factory, the Camaro held its own as one of the most desired contenders from the muscle car era. Here we have a custom Camaro that is far from its factory roots and stuffed full of modern performance and technology. Here's your chance to own a one-of-a-kind '69 <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">Camaro restomod</a>. Don't clear just one space, though. <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">Dream Giveaway</a> is handing over the keys to a paint-matching 2020 Camaro Zl1 equipped with the 1LE Track Package along with it.</p>

<p>Let's break down half of the grand prize package - <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">this '69 Camaro Sport Coupe </a>that went under the knife for a full restoration. This classic car was given the treatment and turned into a restomod. That's right, this vintage muscle car is show-worthy masterpiece filled with modern components.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">Tucked in the bay </a>is a fuel-injected Chevrolet 347-cubic-inch LS1 small-block V8 engine complete with Late Model Racecraft Performance Series head and cam package generates a pavement-pounding 500-horsepower. Shifting power to the rear wheels is a specially selected Tremec 6-speed manual transmission. A set of Hooker headers send spent gases down through a Flowmaster Super 40 Series American Thunder 2.5-inch header-back exhaust system that exit via blacked-out chrome tips. A Strange center-section plays home to a limited-slip differential and 3.73 ring-and-pinion set. The perfect ride height plus handling and drivability are provided by adjustable coil-overs on all four corners and a modern independent front with a 4-link rear suspension.</p>
<p>Finished in a Satin Steel Metallic paint that is worthy of any Concours or SEMA show, the body of this classic Camaro is in fantastic shape with laser-straight sheetmetal. This silver hue also graces the 2020 Camaro ZL1 with 1LE Track Package, the other half to this insanely amazing grand-prize package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">The modern 1969 Camaro </a>is deleted of all body chrome, features flush-mount windshields, vacuum-to-electronic hideaway headlight conversion kit, and LED sequential taillights out back. Blacked out parts consist of the front grille, hood, bumper, decklid, and the 18-inch one-piece HRE wheels that come wrapped with sticky street rubber.</p>
<p>Dream Giveaway retrofitted the cabin of <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/camaro?promo=MOTORIOUS11">this amazing restomod</a> with some of the latest technology and features available from the aftermarket. Sit comfortably in reengineered bucket seats with plush black vinyl seat covers. A six-pod display of direct-fit Auto Meter Ultra-Lite gauges monitor vital signs, a Vintage Air climate-control system keeps the inside at a comfortable temperature, and your favorite tunes bump through a 500W Alpine sound system.</p>
