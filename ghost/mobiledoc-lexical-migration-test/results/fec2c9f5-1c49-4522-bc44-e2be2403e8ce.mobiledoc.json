That’s actually the point because this thing is a real sleeper, not one of these “sleepers” where it’s a car anyone with two brain cells to rub together can ascertain it’s been tuned seven ways to Sunday. No, this thing looks like a piece of crap on wheels with the fading vinyl top, meh paint, etc. The only thing going for it is the more aggressive stance with tucked-in American Racing wheels, but it really looks like a slow, crappy land yacht someone wasted some decent wheels on."

With most of the parts already on hand, including a snarling LS to drop in, Graves used his covid lockdown time to make something truly unique."

Baer brakes with 6-piston calipers plus slotted and cross-drilled rotors help balance out the power. Other upgrades include the suspension, radiator, and much more. The guy put a lot into the build, more than most people would do for an ’83 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, but the results speak for themselves."

The thing sure sounds mean, so if people notice that growl and how it doesn’t square with the faded paint and top, maybe they realize the guy put his money into the mechanicals and not the looks department."
