<hr>
<p>Just say the words “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-started-building-1969-chevelle/">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle project car</a>” not most automotive enthusiasts and you’ll see them perk up. After all, it’s one of the most beloved <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-modern-muscle-cars-race/">American muscle cars</a> of all time, a fact the Mopar and Ford diehards might only admit if they think no recording devices are nearby. Anyway, we ran across this admittedly rough Chevelle <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ebay-find-rusty-1968-camaro/">on eBay</a> and think it could be compelling.</p>

<p>To start off, the seller claims this car is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1968-dodge-charger-barn-find/">numbers-matching barn find</a>. Considering its rough condition, we could envision it having sat unattended in a barn or maybe a shed for a long time. Most of the original Daytona Yellow is gone, but it’s a rare color, the seller claims only 2,841 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/insane-restomod-1966-chevelle/">Chevelles</a> featured the hue, but you’ll have to confirm that yourself.</p>

<p>Even more exciting, this is an SS 396 4-speed. The story goes that a young man in a small farm town bought it and used the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/before-and-after-1970-chevelle-restoration/">Chevelle</a> for street racing. Since it was one hot number back in the day, that seems believable. Then in the late 70s the factory-original engine and transmission were yanked and replaced by a 454 paired to a Turbo 400. The guy also took off the original 12-bolt rear differential, but along with the engine and transmission stored it in the barn, replacing that with a 10-bolt. Before you get too excited, the 454 and Turbo 400 were sold in 1981.</p>

<p>As you can see from the photos, the 396 and 4-speed are still out of the car, so you’d have to reinstall them. The interior looks like some critters might’ve nested down for a while. However, the title is clean. Sure, this car is going to need some serious work, but the payoff could be immense if you’re up to the task.</p>
