<p>Lobbyists for companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google aren’t thrilled about a new bipartisan bill that would stop tech giants from crushing small businesses by employing schemes like ranking their own company products higher than those of third-party sellers. The best way the lobbyists came up with to stop the legislation? Mounting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dont-break-our-prime-2/">a multimillion-dollar ad campaign</a> suggesting that this legislation, if passed, could “break” Amazon Prime’s two-day delivery program.</p>
<p>But would the antitrust bill really derail Amazon’s subscription service? And even if it did, do people really care so much about waiting an extra day for paper towels if it means letting Big Tech suppress competition and harm consumers and small businesses?</p>
