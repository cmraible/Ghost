The two-seater models featured a semi-fastback body profile while the four-door models appeared more curvaceous toward the rear. The redesign seemed to be a hit since the 1968 model year saw a huge spike in production sales which rose above 400,000 units. About 60 percent of that production number can be credited to the Malibu, GM's high-performance Chevelle model. "

A Be-Cool HD aluminum radiator keeps temperatures with the help of dual cooling fans. Hooker ceramic-coated headers send spent gases through an aluminized dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. A March serpentine belt system was also added under the hood. Suspension upgrades from Hotchkiss includes tubular front control arms and Bilstein shock absorbers keep handling in check, and stopping power comes from upgraded 4-wheel Wilwood brakes (6-piston front, 4-piston rear calipers). Even the undercarriage has been highly detailed, and the car has body-color floor pans. This incredible Malibu performs amazingly, but also offers reliability and fuel efficiency."
