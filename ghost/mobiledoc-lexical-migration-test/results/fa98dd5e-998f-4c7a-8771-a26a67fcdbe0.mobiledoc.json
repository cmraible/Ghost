A game like this would certainly benefit from some kind of objective marker because even though I was paying close attention, it wasn’t always clear where I needed to go next. In most games, this wouldn’t be an issue because exploration is fun, but there really isn’t anything beneficial about going off the beaten path here. Usually, all exploration gets you is a cookie-cutter explanation about how you don’t need to be here right now and getting quickly brought back to the map. The story can get fairly complicated, and it gets annoying quickly to go to every map location looking for the next way to progress, only to be met with an even more frustrating version of “Your Princess is in Another Castle”. When a game such as this, which feels like a carefully crafted work of art, has an annoying oversight like this, it tends to stand out more, especially in a game which requires so little input from the player."
