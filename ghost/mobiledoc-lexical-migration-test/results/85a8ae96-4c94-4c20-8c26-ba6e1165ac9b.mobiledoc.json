          "What would you do if you had one chance to change history? Would you do what is best for the world, or would you do what is best — or easiest — for you? That is the subject of many of the stories we explore in this week’s Weekend Reader. One article reveals how rare-metal interests are rushing to mine the deepest parts of the ocean, with little regard to the disastrous consequences for a part of the world we know very little about. Another story details how a tiny activist investment firm had the guts to stand up to a fossil fuel giant, and ended up securing a major victory. And an illuminating profile depicts West Virginia Democratic Joe Manchin as “a man standing athwart history, not quite yelling ‘Stop,’ but certainly yelling ‘Whoa.’”"

Of those, less than half were put to a vote, and just a tiny sliver gained majority support; even successful resolutions are nonbinding, so companies can still dismiss them afterward.

Many have been turning to bankruptcy in an attempt to shed their debts, reorganize their assets, and, in some cases, offload their environmental obligations. Utilizing limitations and loopholes in bankruptcy law, these companies are employing a playbook perfected by coal companies to shed their environmental and labor liabilities.”"

It’s rarer that companies try to mislead and intimidate the press into falling into the lines that they want. But of the dozen journalists I spoke with for this story, most of whom declined to be identified out of concern for professional repercussions, all recalled times Amazon’s press team had engaged in manipulative and sometimes deceitful behavior. According to these writers and editors, and my own experience reporting on the company, Amazon’s comms team readily employs these rarer, bare-knuckle PR tactics. The ultimate result isn’t just that reporters have a harder time writing stories. Some may be deterred from writing on the company at all. And if those that do are deceived and unduly influenced, then by extension the public is as well.”"

Have there been moments when you had to make a major decision that would have long-lasting consequences, and if so, what did you decide?"

          ". For starters, in April 2020, David had to follow through with the crazy idea of starting a subscriber-funded news outlet after the insane concept first popped into his head, rather than just pursue any of the million options that would have been far easier. Then he had to decide to build the sort of organization that could support a growing team of reporters and editors breaking regular news scoops, rather than just opt for a far more simple vanity newsletter where he could just put out his own thoughts whenever he felt like it."

We opted for the harder move, and now, as we continue to build, we are staring down new — and increasingly nerve-wracking — inflection points."

But then we asked ourselves, what do we want to be able to say at the end of the day? That we puttered along and always took the safe choice? Or that even if we went down in flames, at least we gave everything our best shot, and tried to build the sort of news organization we have always wanted to work for?"
