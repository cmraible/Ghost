<p>Featured on Season 1 Episode 3 of the series, this May 26, 2014 build is a true celebrity. It makes a strong statement from the first moment you lay eyes on the bike. A purple powder coated frame contrasts with the raw aluminum fenders, saddlebags, side covers, and tanks. Patina brass trim, including the grips, pegs, and air cleaner add a curiously rustic quality to the design. A humongous front wheel adds to the aggressive nature of this ride, ensuring nobody will be able to ignore it, no matter where you roll.</p>
<p>There’s tons of custom equipment on this bike, making it something that’s awesome to look at and ride. For example, it uses an S&S prototype 132CI X-Wedge dual plenum throttle body, and there are only four in existence. Custom front brakes and Performance Machine rear brakes allow for quick stops and excellent control on the road. A 6-speed Baker transmission and custom 2-inch open belt primary by Evil Engineering help put power to the road. The ISR hand controls with brass accents are from Sweden, adding a foreign flair to the build.</p>
<p>Considering this motorcycle is a truly one-of-a-kind with meticulous attention paid to the smallest details, it’s quite the thing to add to your garage. Since it’s been on a popular TV show watched and loved by many, you can bet this bike will continue to appreciate in value as time passes on. <a href="https://www.classiccarliquidators.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Classic Car Liquidators</a> is offering this motorcycle for sale.</p>
