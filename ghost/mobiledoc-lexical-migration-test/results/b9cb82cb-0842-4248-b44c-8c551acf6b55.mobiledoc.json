Just beyond said Continental is a 1956 Chevrolet Nomad which comes from a very rough origin but was eventually restored. One of the owner's most prized vehicles is his 1940 Ford four-window coupe which he has had since the 80s. Another more modern vehicle is the 1940 Dodge Town Wagon which sits atop an S-10 frame."

In the yard we find a lifted Chevy truck from the 90s, a dropped Chevy truck from the late 90s or early 2000s, a 1965 C10 Pickup, and a Chrysler Station wagon. Our third location reveals a 1951 fiberglass-body Mercury, another lifted square-body Chevy truck, along with many other projects such as a 1500 Truck and a Ford GT40 kit car."

Towards the back you’ll find a 50s Chevy truck, a 40s Ford coupe, these vehicles are joined by many rotting project cars. A more exciting entry is the late 40s Ford coupe effectively named “The Kool-Aid Kid” equipped with a 427ci Chevy Big Block. In yet another barn we find a Buick convertible and a C3 Corvette. If you dare venture into the forest you’ll find a myriad of dead project cars, however, we won't get into this part for the sake of time. There you have it, this is quite an impressive list, to say the least, and will hopefully only grow with time."
