Most officers/deputies patrol the streets so much they get to know every nook and cranny, giving them quite the advantage versus someone like this Dodge Charger driver. After a deputy in Georgia tries pulling the Mopar muscle car over on the highway, the suspect tries losing the fuzz on surface streets only to be thwarted by none other than the dread dead end."

After calling in the plate, the deputy activates his lights and the Charger pulls progressively from the left to the right lane, signaling every lane change. Maybe had the suspect just pulled onto the shoulder, been cordial with the deputy, and kept a level head he might have only gotten away with a warning."

However, the Deputy doesn’t disappear quietly into that good night, so the suspect has to pull out another trick."

After all, the suspect is only making it easier for the deputy to run him down."

Instead of hurrying after, the deputy waits for backup to arrive, realizing there’s going to be a search on foot. When you see the low effort these guys put into running away, it’s understandable why the deputy wasn’t in a hurry. Is this all the result of kids not playing outside much anymore? Are criminals able to do less physically, so foot chases just aren’t all that exciting?"
