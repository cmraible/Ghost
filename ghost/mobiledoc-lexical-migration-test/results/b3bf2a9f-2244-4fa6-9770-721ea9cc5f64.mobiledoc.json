And while the NSX was a technological wonder when it came out, European manufacturers quickly leapfrogged it, leaving Honda in the dust as it didn’t bother to update its so-called supercar, finally sunsetting it after the turn of the century. Yet people continued shelling out big bucks for something which was surpassed by rather pedestrian vehicles by that point."

Ultimately, it wouldn’t be surprising if the restoration costs more than just buying a cherry NSX somewhere. Even making this NSX a track toy is going to be costly, but that’s the new owner’s decision and business."
