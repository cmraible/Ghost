The drone operator noticed the shape of a vehicle submerged in the lake, calling the Mason County Sheriff’s Office to report the finding. Deputies arrived on scene and so did some rescue divers, who helped with the recovery."

Divers and a two truck had their work cut out for them since the Porsche was lodged in quite a bit of mud. If you’ve ever gotten an off-roader or truck stuck in the muck, you know how much suction power the stuff can have."

You’ll notice it doesn’t look parted out, save for the missing headlights. Since nobody popped the hood for the cameras, we don’t know if the engine is still there or if it has the more desirable V8."

It’s nice, which is a plus, but one of the bigger motivations for swiping such a car would be superior performance versus your average ride. How exactly they boosted it hasn’t been made clear, but we’d be interested to know since modern Porsches like Audis and a few other brands are known for being difficult to take."

Always keep it locked, secure your keys, park in a garage at night if you can, and maybe think of installing some extra security features to make it harder to steal."
