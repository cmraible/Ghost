<p>In 1964, the <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/1965-ford-mustang-fastback?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article3&utm_campaign=may">Mustang</a> created an all new segment in the automotive market. Attention was immediate and profound, and the Mustang quickly became one of America’s favorite cars. With three assembly plants working around the clock to accommodate the market, Ford added to its successes with an all new K-Code Fastback model in 1965. The <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/1965-ford-mustang-fastback?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article3&utm_campaign=may">K-Code 2+2 Fastback Mustang</a> featured a  271-­horsepower 289-cid High-Performance V8 engine topped with a special Autolite four­-barrel carburetor from the factory, implementing solid valve lifters and a 10.5:1 compression ratio. </p>
