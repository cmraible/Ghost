Eventually, Daniel  was able to purchase the Chevelle for just $300 which is insane considering if you’d want a rusty example today you’d be paying at least in the thousands. Of course, an 11-year-old isn’t going to have much luck working on cars which is why the vehicle was stored until Daniel  turns 17. 22 years later, the beautiful work of art that Daniel  began working on when he was 17 years old finally came together under the name “the Malibeast”."
