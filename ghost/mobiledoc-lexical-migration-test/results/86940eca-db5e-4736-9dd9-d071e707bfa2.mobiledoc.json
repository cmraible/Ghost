While it sucks having your everyday commuter car stolen, having a beloved, rare collectable swiped is far worse. Even worse, a man in Anderson, California had his 1966 Shelby Cobra continuation car stolen back in the summer of 2021. It was just recovered, or at least pieces of it were."

Sadly, the Shelby now resembles just that since it was found in pieces with plenty of it missing. This is not the ending anyone wanted to see."

Since a lot of car thieves have criminal histories, that could pan out. The California Department of Justice Bureau of Forensic Services might be brought on to help with this case. However, there’s no guarantee the prosecutor or judge won’t go easy on these guys if they’re caught. That factor alone seems to be helping fuel the out-of-control car theft surge sweeping this nation and many others."
