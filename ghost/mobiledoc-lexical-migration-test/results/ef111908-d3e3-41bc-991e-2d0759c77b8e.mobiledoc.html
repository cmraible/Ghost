According to McLaren, the 2019 model has the exact same 0-62-mph time of 2.8-seconds and, just like the P1, is capable of sprinting to 124-mph in just 6.8-seconds. In case you were wondering how a less powerful engine equates to nearly identical performance, it all comes down to weight saved by the lack of an electric motor and battery.</p>

<p>Not only <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0069-2019-mclaren-senna/1019686?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">does the model</a> feature race car-like capabilities, appearance wise, it is again all race car. However, its massive front splitter and enormous rear wing is far from being purely aesthetic. The pair, along with a host of scoops, louvers, and diffusers all come together in the name of aerodynamics to provide the Senna with the ability to create 1,700-pounds of downforce at 155-mph. Through the use of this active Drag Reduction System, the Senna is capable of using aerodynamics to create downforce, trim drag, or air brake.</p>

<p>Despite being a worthy opponent to the P1 race car, the Senna does not compromise comfort in the name of performance. <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0069-2019-mclaren-senna/1019686?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">Take this 2019 McLaren Senna</a> that is currently being sold by RM Sotheby’s for example. The interior is uniquely finished in Alcantara with exposed carbon fiber and Burton Blue details. It features $360,000 dollars worth of bespoke and optional features that include 24 karat gold plate heat shielding, exposed carbon fiber finish, a digital display, and a Bowers and Wilkens audio system. The original owner also had Paint Protection Film installed and has only driven the car less than 500 miles. <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0069-2019-mclaren-senna/1019686?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">It is expected to sell</a> for at least $1-million and has barely even been broken in.</p>
