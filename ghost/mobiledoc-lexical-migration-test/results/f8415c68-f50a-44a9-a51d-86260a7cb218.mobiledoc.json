They presented it to him as a surprise present back in 2007. Now, a lucky person will be the new owner of this unique and rather famous Swedish wagon. If you want that person to be you, check out RM Sotheby’s High Speed: Paul Newman’s Racing Legacy online auction right now since it’s over on June 13."
