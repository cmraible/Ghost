<p>A reminder that tonight at 7pm ET (4pm PT) is our weekly Callin show, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/r/4f1e6b34?m=a7b279ce-358b-4eb5-878d-3569762cfedc"><em>Lever Live</em></a>. This week David Sirota is joined by Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh to explore why once again Democrats are ignoring economic messaging in the run-up to a key election. With inflation still rising, the economy is Â votersâ€™ number-one concern â€” so why are Dems ceding the issue to Republicans? Join us tonight as David and Mark unpack this bizarre and infuriating tendency, and take questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
