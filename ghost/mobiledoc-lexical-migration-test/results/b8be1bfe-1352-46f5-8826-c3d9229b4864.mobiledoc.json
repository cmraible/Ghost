Black, was piloting the 720-horsepower Barracuda restomod on the infamous Mulholland Drive, also known as \"The Snake\", when things went south. Black lost control and sent the car careening down an embankment and through a wooden fence. The car was made to sit two people, but three were int he car at the time - Hart, Black, and a female passenger crammed on the rear seat delete. Both Hart and Black suffered back injuries, and the woman with them suffered minor injuries. After the accident, it was said that Hart may be armed with lawyers to sue SpeedKore, the company who built the '70 Barracuda, for allowing him to take possession of the car lacking the proper safety equipment. Common sense tells us that maybe stuffing three people inside a high-horsepower car fit for two without the proper safety equipment AND pushing its abilities on a road infamous for accidents isn't such a great idea."

If this legislation is approved, that means that all cars, no matter how old, must have seatbelts or harnesses installed to be legal and road worthy. While safety is no doubt a priority, these classics have been around for decades without any of these features. Also, this means drilling holes into million-dollar Concours cars just to add tacky seatbelts that will hardly ever be used. Plus, it is not unheard of for these laws to trickle over to other states."
