However, that's precisely what this extremely unique vehicle is, as it boasts the best engineering one could find in its time. In fact, this car has so much work done to it that it's considered wildly fast today compared to modern vehicles. That's because this was built for the dry lake bed of El Mirage, where it raced for the entirety of its racing career. Eventually, it was abandoned and rediscovered in 2004 around the Victorville, California area, a little far from Arizona. ",

All of that power is then sent through a three-speed manual transmission which also sports a reverse function. With the vehicle approaching its 80th birthday, it needs a new owner to complete its journey. The only question is, who will be brave enough to purchase this racing and automotive history piece?",
