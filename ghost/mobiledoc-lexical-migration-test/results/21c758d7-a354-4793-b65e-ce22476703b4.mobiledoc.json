Of course, building a muscle car that doesn't follow the norm is sure to leave traditionalists with sweaty palms and a furrowed brow. Perhaps, that's when you know you're doing something right. That is sure to be the case here with Riley Stair's seven-foot-wide 1970 Pontiac Trans Am that doubles as a piece of artwork as well as a track-ripping dominator."

That is an incredible feat considering that SEMA plays home to some of the world's most insane car builds. Even better, owner Riley Stair built and fabricated the car himself just outside of his parent's garage bay. "

Even more impressive is that this wild motor complete with captivating headers is completely naturally aspirated. There are no power-adders such as a blower, turbochargers, or nitrous to help launch this beast into motion, just a high-compression engine with a goal of 1,000-horsepower. "

As we struggle to get more and more of the younger crowd into our hobby to keep it growing, everyone can appreciate the amount of work and ingenuity that went into creating this insane muscle car build that doubles as a rolling and powerful work of art inside and out."
