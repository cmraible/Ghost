Like a beautiful dancer gracefully hopping across the street, these cars were quick, agile, and smooth. So it makes sense that the Impala would become one of the nation’s most iconic vehicles. This particular vehicle lived that legend with style and grace before eventually winding up where it stands today."

It’s clear that this car was used and abused to the fullest extent. It would honestly be crazy if it wasn’t because it came from the factory with some of the best powertrain options available in its time. This pertains especially to the transmission, though the engine certainly is a great piece of art."

That’s because it was a great option in both the Impala and Chevelle at the time, turning the large luxury cruisers into quick street racers. On top of that, the rear wheels are spun via the four-speed manual transmission, yet another icon of engineering. Overall, this was a great muscle car in its prime and despite its condition it would be lovely to see it back on the road once again. Do you think it’s possible?"
