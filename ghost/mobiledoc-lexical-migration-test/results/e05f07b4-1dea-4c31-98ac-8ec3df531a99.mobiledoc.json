          " is  one  of the most iconic cars to ever come out of the Mopar assembly plant in the late 1960s. You could argue this was due to its incredible performance, good looks, or well-built engine. Either way, these are  simply amazing cars  with  many attributes we can't list off entirely, though  they are all very good. This particular car is a great example of what made  the GTX such a great vehicle in  the first place with some special features you won't find on just any Plymouth. So what makes this vehicle so special compared to some  other stunning Mopar muscle cars?"

Along with its wild looks, this V8 should be capable of some pretty insane performance numbers. That's because it's got 440 cubic inches of displacement flowing through the block which would have been good for around 375 horsepower back in the day. That is if the vehicle were stock, and it certainly is not original in any  sense of the word,  but don't worry that's a good thing."

In fact, everything about this vehicle screams with its Turquoise/blue exterior calling the names of practically any enthusiast with working eyes. Altogether, this is an amazing custom classic car build with thousands of hours of hard-work and dedication put into the build and maintenance. Now  you have the  chance to get behind the wheel as the car is up for auction and is likely to  hit the road again soon."
