There was a point not long ago when dealers were offering people more money for their two- or three-year-old car than it sold for new, the market was so tight. Paying over MSRP for a new vehicle was also just accepted for just about every brand under the sun. Now that’s starting to change and quickly as people are walking away from custom car orders, leaving dealers with secretly swelling inventories."

Instead of getting the more powerful Dodge V8 models, people are opting for R/Ts or something with a V6 engine. That makes us wince as enthusiasts, but at the same time when money’s tight you have to make sacrifices, so it's understandable."

          "YouTuber Ben Hardy also believes this phenomenon of people walking away from factory-ordered vehicles is going to cause new car prices to drop like a rock as we enter 2023. As he points out, special order vehicles usually have an unappealing spec to the average shopper, meaning they aren’t snatched up as quickly and might sell for far less than the original customer was willing to pay. He also focuses on tightening lending practices, people selling extra vehicles at greater rates out of fear of rapid market devaluation, and spiking demand for cheap and fuel-efficient models as adding fuel to the fire.
