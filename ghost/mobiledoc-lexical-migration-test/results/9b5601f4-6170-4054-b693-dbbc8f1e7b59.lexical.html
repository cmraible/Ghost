<p>For its first year, <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851908-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray">the C8 garnered</a> a lot of attention for the most dramatic change to the model to date. Love it or hate it, although what is there to hate, the new mid-engine design <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851908-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray">gave the Corvette</a> a clear advantage over the previous model year and Chevy hasn’t even gotten to the special packages yet such as the Z06, Grand Sport, ZR1, or the all-new Zora variant. One step at a time though. If you haven’t been able to get your hands on a new <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851908-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray">2020 Chevrolet Corvette</a>, your options may be dwindling but don’t give up the search yet.</p>

<p>While looking at the car it is hard not to get overwhelmed by the beauty of the massive design changes that allowed for the enormous V8 to be mid-mounted but if you think GM stopped re-engineering <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851908-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray">the Corvette there</a>, you are mistaken. The interior has also been completely wrapped in a dark colored genuine leather that is not quite black. Perfectly accenting the upholstery is shiny aluminum trim. This particular car also features a massive touchscreen display as well. This is without a doubt one of the nicest interiors GM has ever <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851908-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray">given the Corvette</a>. With 674 views, a current high bid of $75,000, and 9 days left, this could be one of the last opportunities to pick a <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851908-2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray">new 2020 Corvette</a>.</p>
