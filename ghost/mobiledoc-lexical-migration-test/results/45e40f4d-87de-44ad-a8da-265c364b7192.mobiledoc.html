<p>Some call this the last great Pontiac muscle car!</p>
<p>Authentic Trans Am Super Duty cars are not as easy to come by as they once were, which is why <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/187087/1974-pontiac-trans-am-super-duty">this inventory find</a> made the cut for the pick of the day. This numbers matching poncho is a  rare classic, without the rare classic price, coming in at just under  $80K - not bad considering second-generation F-Bodies frequently nip at  the $100K mark during private sale.</p>

<p>This stunning <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/397214/pontiac-trans-am-y82">Pontiac</a> seen in the ad is one of only 943 Super Duty <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/305052/hpp-camaro-trans-am">Trans Ams</a> made in 1974, one of only 731 automatics, and it looks like it time  traveled straight to 2020. It’s evident that this car was carefully  cared for by a a professional, or, at the very least, stored in a  professional manner. Every aspect of the car is nearly in ‘better than  factory’ condition, with the finest body alignment possible.</p>

<p>The interior rocks the color correct white bucket seats and black  carpeting. While the floor mats pictured inside the car appear to be a  rubber aftermarket version, it appears that the embroidered mats are  included, as indicated by a picture showing them in the trunk. The  molded consoles houses a small automatic shifter that controls the TH400  automatic transmission - with an AM/FM radio still sits in the factory  location.</p>

<p>Under the hood lurks a monster SD-455 V8 engine with a correct Y8  stamped block, L203 date code, GH stamped heads, and correct LS2 cast  intake. Options from 1974 were loaded on this Trans Am, like factory air  conditioning, power windows, tilt steering wheel, custom trim group,  rear window defroster, power door locks, rally gauges, power disc  brakes, and 15” Rally II wheels wrapped in radial tires.</p>
