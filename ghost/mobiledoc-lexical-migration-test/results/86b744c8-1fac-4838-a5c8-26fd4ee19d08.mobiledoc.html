<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We had a lot of exciting conversations this past week on <em>The Lever</em>’s podcast network. On <em>Lever Time</em>, we were joined by MSNBC host Chris Hayes to discuss the upcoming midterm elections. We discussed Democrats’ campaign strategy, the state of pivotal races, and how the media has been covering the contests. I also spoke with author Anand Giridharadas about his new book on the power of persuasion. On <em>The Audit</em>, the study group learned one of George W. Bush’s most important lessons: “How To Avoid Being Prosecuted For War Crimes.” Sorry, that was supposed to say, “How To Hold Yourself Accountable.”</p>

<p>Rock the boat,</p>

<p>Dave, Josh and their study-buddy Kate Willett trudge their way through George W. Bush’s next two MasterClass lessons, “Accountability Leads to Results” and “Crisis Management.” We wish this was an ironic joke, but sadly, it’s not…</p>

<p>This week, Dubya walks the study group through all the ways he showed amazing leadership and accountability during 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, AND the 2008 financial crisis. The short version: It all comes down to acting like you care.</p>
<p>The <em>Audit</em> team also examines one of the few (not entirely terrible) things Bush did — the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — and how he still managed to get some terrible stuff into the initiative. They also examine how Bush’s experience in the world of business doesn’t jibe with his stated belief in free markets. AND “No Child Left Behind” gets the MasterClass whitewash treatment!</p>
