<p>Here's the overview:</p>
<blockquote><em>Mask of the Rose</em> is a romantic visual novel about love, mystery, the restructuring of society after profound change, and bats.<br><br>In one playthrough of <em>Mask of the Rose</em> you might romance a partner, or help your friends find love; untangle a poisoner's motives, or uncover the fate of poor, drowned Parliament; house some of London's new, not-so-human inhabitants, or help establish the new Feast of the Rose, a festival that will be celebrated in London for decades to come!<br><br>By replaying you can explore different storylines and pursue new goals. London’s deeper secrets will only emerge over multiple playthroughs!<br><br>The gameplay of<em> Mask of the Rose </em>extends beyond dialogue. You'll open new locations on the map, gather outfits and disguises, work odd jobs and collect resources. Together, this will determine what you can attempt in social situations – and how much you can get away with!<br><br>Mask of the Rose is set in Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a train journey away. <br><br>We’ve been exploring the Fallen London universe over eleven years and five different games (including Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies). If you’re a newcomer, Mask of the Rose is the perfect jumping-on point. If you’re already a fan, it offers new discoveries and a chance to explore more personal stories, including encounters with favourite characters.</blockquote>
