<p>Jump onto the cog and when you stand on it, it will turn. Make sure that you’re facing right and the bottom platform will rotate clockwise. We’re going to want to rotate the bottom platform until it gets to this point and rotate the bottom-middle platform until it gets to this point…</p>

<p>When you drop down and continue right through the forest, another villager will destroy the big boulder with an exploding pinecone. Keep heading right and you’ll see the second villager in need of your help. To get to them, jump onto the tree branch and let it bounce and propel you upwards.</p>

<h3>Main Objective: Go to the meeting point</h3>
<p>Jump down and proceed to the right of screen. You’ll come across another cutscene with more explosive pinecone goodness. Once that’s done, we’ll want to head to the meeting point, but we’ll need the card first. For this, you’ll want to head into the Sunshine Club, however the robot will scan you and judge whether you have enough style.</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Get swaggy</h3>

<p>Head back out and up to the forest. Proceed right, jump onto the trees that have been cut down and kick the giant robot.</p>

<p>This will initiate the boss fight. The aim of this fight is to avoid the circular saw. The robot will suddenly drop its saw on either the left or right side and will slide it along the ground, so your job is to jump over it. The trick to figuring out which side the robot is going to drop its saw is by watching its eyes. Either the left or right robot will duck its head for a second, almost as if it’s winking at you.</p>

<p>After avoiding the saw twice, kick the explosive pinecone that the rebel on the right throws down to you. This will hit the robot and do damage to it.</p>

<p>Repeat that process two more times (You’ll only need to avoid the saw once for these rounds) and victory will be yours! After the fight, the rebels will bring you back to the hideout.</p>
