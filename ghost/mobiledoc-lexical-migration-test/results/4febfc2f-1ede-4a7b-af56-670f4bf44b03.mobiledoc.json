You have the Basic Shot, Topspin, Slice and Lob.<br />\nYou can even aim with Zone Shot that allows you to use motion controls that will cause damage to your opponent’s racket and allows you to pinpoint a spot on your opponent’s side of the court. If they take more than three hits, it’s in instant KO. But don’t sweat, you can block Zone Shots with Block.<br />\nUsing Zone Speed uses slow motion allowing you to block Zone Shots. These abilities require the use of some of your energy gauge that replenishes over time or by using Trick Shots. However, you may waste energy with the Trick Shot, or even miss the ball, so make sure you use it wisely!<br />\nWith the Special Shot, unleash a devastating shot that can turn the tide, but be careful, it uses A LOT of energy.<br />\nIf this all sounds a bit much for you, there is also a Simple Rules mode with classic rules that we know and love.<br />\nThere will be online support with tournaments and exclusive unlockables (such as special in-game outfits and additional characters), so make sure you go online and play against friends and others around the world.<br />\nWith the brand new Swing Mode, you can use the JoyCon like a tennis racket and play with motion controls (Wii Sports flashbacks!).<br />\nThere is also a Pre-Launch Online Tournament with details coming at a later date, so stay tuned for that!<br />\n<strong>Release Date: June 22nd</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</h1>\n<p><iframe title=\"Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker - Switch and 3DS Reveal\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mQQ-ZOMvoU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Following the Wii U port train, this adorable game is coming to the Switch.
