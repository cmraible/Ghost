          " is one of the most popular today. Chevrolet has made some highly collectible trucks over the years, but the second-generation C-10 is one of the most popular today. This 1972 Chevrolet C-10 adds several custom touches and an eye-catching purple paint job to complement the truck's vintage style, and it will certainly turn heads whether you're out for a cruise or parked at a classic car show. The attention to detail is obvious everywhere on this truck, but the best is the cargo bed lined with white pine and the show-worthy engine compartment stuffed with a 400 cubic-inch V8. This truck is being listed for $20,900, and you can click "

The retro design was modeled after the Chevrolet Advance Design truck, which was built from 1947 through 1955, while the Corvette-derived 6.0-liter V8 (offered for the 2005 and 2006 model years) laid down an impressive 390 horsepower. This Redline Red Chevy SSR is a true collector with just 76,000 miles on the odometer, and it has the desirable six-speed manual transmission option. It's being sold for $23,900, and you can click "
