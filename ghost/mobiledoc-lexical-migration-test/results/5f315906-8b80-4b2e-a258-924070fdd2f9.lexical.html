<p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/19/andrew-cuomo-fbi-donors-nursing-homes"><strong>FBI Reportedly Investigating Cuomo Role In Shielding Donors From Covid Liability</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>A good overview of the latest bombshell in Cuomo’s ongoing nursing home scandal, which includes a nice shout-out to </em>The Daily Poster<em>’s efforts breaking open the story.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161721/gas-price-wars-gop-rick-scott"><strong>Gas Price Wars Are Back and More Incoherent Than Ever</strong></a> (The New Republic) — <em>“For much of the last half-century, the U.S. has held contradictory positions when it comes to energy. Car-centric planning makes consumers depend on cheap fuel. But the fracking industry depends on fuel not being cheap, since such unconventional drilling methods are expensive. American politicians claim that fracking has made us energy independent, though the price of fuel still depends in large part on decisions made halfway across the world by countries with more say over how much they produce. Politicians in the U.S. aren’t willing to do the only thing that could help sort out this situation, which is to coordinate and curtail production domestically.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-a-salt-monopoly-could-spike-car"><strong>How a Salt Monopoly Could Spike Car Accidents in the Midwest</strong></a> (Big) — <em>“In the winter, when it’s really cold and snowy, what Americans need is not a competitive semiconductor industry or better app stores. They need salt. And not the kind of salt that flavors our food, but the kind that melts snow and ice. If we don’t have salt, no one can drive, because salt is what keeps our roads manageable. Without salt, trucks can’t deliver supplies, people can’t get to stores or work, and the economy comes to a standstill. And people die. A lot of them.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/hedge-funds-wall-street-game-stop-capitalism"><strong>You Can't Hurt Hedge Funds By Acting Exactly Like Them</strong></a> (In These Times) —<em> “Want to know what would really piss off Wall Street? A financial transactions tax. A stronger labor movement. A more aggressive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A wealth tax. All of the pitchforks-and-torches sentiment we see now is great. But it only works if it accomplishes something that the forces of capital actually fear.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/18/oil-industry-fossil-fuels-air-pollution-documents"><strong>Oil Firms Knew Decades Ago Fossil Fuels Posed Grave Health Risks, Files Reveal</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“The documents, which include internal memos and reports, show the industry was long aware that it created large amounts of air pollution, that pollutants could lodge deep in the lungs and be ‘real villains in health effects,’ and even that its own workers may be experiencing birth defects among their children.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/03/16/oil-friendly-states-fight-back-against-sustainable-investment-trend"><strong>Oil-Friendly States Fight Back Against Sustainable Investment Trend</strong></a> (The Pew Charitable Trusts) — <em>“In Alaska, North Dakota, Texas and other energy-producing states where fossil fuel taxes support state budgets, some lawmakers are introducing legislation that would force states to stop investing in companies that use sustainable strategies to make financial decisions and to cut ties with asset managers, banks and insurers that are doing the same.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/truckers-lease-deal-pathways-lawsuit-highway-safety-supply-chain-11907958"><strong>How Lease Deals Have Truckers Hauling a Load of Debt</strong></a><strong></strong>(Westword) — <em>“The Pathway case is one of several across the country that have been filed by drivers, challenging what they claim are predatory leasing schemes. The cases have exposed dark corners of a chaotic and highly competitive industry, one that often treats truckers not as lords of the highway, but as disposable serfs, bound to their masters by a form of debt peonage. The lease deals also raise public-safety concerns, as testimony has emerged concerning drivers’ long hours behind the wheel. Merrill and others say truckers feel pressured to push federal limits on their working hours as they struggle to make payments on high-mileage big rigs that may not be entirely roadworthy.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/15/what-happens-when-investment-firms-acquire-trailer-parks"><strong>What Happens When Investment Firms Acquire Trailer Parks</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>“One sign that a large investment firm has taken over a neighborhood is a dramatic spike in lot rent. Once a home is stationed on a lot, it is not always possible to move it; if it is possible, doing so can cost as much as ten thousand dollars. Most buyers aren’t eligible for fifteen- or thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages, so many of them finance their homes with high-interest ‘chattel loans,’ made against personal property. ‘The vulnerability of these residents is part of the business model,’ Sullivan said. ‘This is a captive class of tenant.’ A leader of an association for mobile-home owners in Washington State has compared life in a mobile-home park to ‘a feudal system.’”</em></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>There has been an intensifying debate about the future of media — and whether or not newsletters can be part of the solution to the journalism crisis in America. I think they can be, but only if they encourage more investment in teams of journalists, rather than in individual brands.</p>
<p>When I decided to start this project nearly a year ago, I didn’t want to just write my own self-branded newsletter. I wanted to try to build a news outlet that funds original reporting. I did this because I truly believe that we need a vibrant free press in America, and I believe the best way to construct that is to build new and better journalism institutions.</p>
<p>As a subscriber to <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you know that we are trying to build exactly that. And so far, thanks to you, it has been successful. We’ve broken open big stories and had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/report-fbi-now-probing-cuomos-corporate/">real-world impact</a>.</p>
<p>Building a news outlet is not easy. In fact, it can be a slog. It requires an investment of limited resources and a serious editorial and fact-checking process. But almost a year into this project, I know the sacrifices we’ve made to do this have been worth it.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> has taken a different path than many of the new media ventures that focus on amplifying single name-brand pundits and hot takes. Instead of building a personal brand or trying to just push a party line, we are investing in a team of journalists producing original reporting that holds both parties accountable.</p>
<p>We are part of a small-but-growing movement to construct a new model for journalism that avoids replicating the kind of winner-take-all, wealth-concentrated, individual-pundit-focused news ecosystem that already exists in corporate media.</p>
<p>My hope is that we see more of this in the coming months. I want to see name-brand journalists and pundits use the new technologies and platforms not just as a tool to build up their already big brands, but to instead invest some of their cachet and resources into building new independent media institutions that support a new generation of journalists.</p>
<p>Yes, it requires some sacrifice. Yes, it requires a willingness to invest and spread resources to others. Yes, it is a much tougher road than simply building a personal brand. And yes, it remains unclear whether this model can be successful in the long run.</p>
<p>But yes, it is absolutely worth the effort and the risk. Because without a vibrant free press of strong independent journalism outlets, our democracy will remain imperiled.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our <em>Daily Poster</em> team as we do our part to revive independent journalism and create a better media. We couldn’t do it without you.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
