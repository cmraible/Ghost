<p>The notable American icon has and always will be the coveted prize in the minds of every collector, enthusiast, and car person alike. The 1967 Mustang has such a good design that it was featured in many movies in its prime time. Some of these include the infamous ‘Stang from the movie <em>Bullitt </em>and the forever recognizable ‘Eleanor’ from <em>Gone in 60 seconds</em>. What is particularly fascinating about this car however is that while other Mustangs of that same year barely even run now, because of the modern performance upgrades this thing can duke it out with modern muscle/ pony cars too.</p>

<p>A lot of the time when people want a classic car they usually don't get it, this is either due to money or the fact that it is so old that it would take forever to replace it. That is where resto-mods like this come into play. Gone are the days of having to sacrifice reliability for cool-factor, because this car is basically a brand new car with the body of a ‘67 Mustang.

Say goodbye to transmission issues because this comes equipped with a brand new automatic overdrive transmission.
