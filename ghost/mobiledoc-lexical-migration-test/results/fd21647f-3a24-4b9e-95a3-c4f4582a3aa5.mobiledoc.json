Tucked inside an oversized shed or what some might call a barn on an undisclosed property is a very rare quadruple black 1970 Plymouth Hemi ‘Cuda. This is the kind of classic American muscle car gearheads of the Mopar persuasion dream about owning. Understandably, for many it’s upsetting seeing such a legend just left to sit, while simultaneously being absolutely mesmerizing."

Even back then the original engine wasn’t in the car, meaning it’s not numbers-matching and so isn’t worth nearly as much. Still, this thing is a solid discovery."

It was originally stored in an actual barn for years, but before that the owner had it in a garage. Now it’s in this storage shed with a giant garage door for easy access, even though it doesn’t get driven."

Not only does it have black paint and a black interior, the vinyl top and rubber bumpers are also black. Someone wanted a murdered-out car before that whole trend became super hot, although at least it doesn’t ride on black wheels."
