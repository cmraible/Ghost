Don’t get me wrong, I had more fun with this than most Open World games I’ve played in recent years; in fact, I really enjoy that the game makes you do some of the side content before continuing with the story to give that extra work actual purpose instead of something you do on your way to a story section or if you’re bored; but in the end, if you take away the shark-themed coat of paint, it just becomes a game you’ve played many, many, MANY times before."
