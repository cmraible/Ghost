And while both Mopars are quite collectible these days, thanks to the homologation specials being made in small numbers, the Charger Daytonas are slightly faster. Differences in the design of the nose cone, wing, and other body panels meant the Dodge boasted a coefficient of drag of just .29 versus .31 for the Superbird. In high-speed, long-distance races that made quite the difference."

However, it couldn’t be sold in California and a handful of other states because the truck didn’t meet noise ordinance requirements."
