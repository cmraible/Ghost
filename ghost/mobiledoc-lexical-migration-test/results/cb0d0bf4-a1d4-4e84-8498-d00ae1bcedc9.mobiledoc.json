The vehicle is obviously a crossover of sorts, although the low-slung roof, two doors, and aggressive front fascia just scream Corvette. There have been rumors of a Corvette SUV coming out soon, and this looks like it might be an early design concept."

Basically, the automaker would come out with a whole range of vehicles called Corvettes, from the traditional sports car line to a sporty crossover as well as a sedan. As you can imagine, that’s really got people worked up in a lather."
