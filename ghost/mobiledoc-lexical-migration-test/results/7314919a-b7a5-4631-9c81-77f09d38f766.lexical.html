<p>The 1971 Dodge Daytona Prototype Concept was constructed with the idea that if Chrysler greenlit production, this is what the pre-production prototype would look like. Unlike a custom car, which are often personal flights of fancy, Gary and Pam brought what Chrysler designers had envisioned and factory engineers had tested. The difference is in the details and the Beineke's got it right.</p>
