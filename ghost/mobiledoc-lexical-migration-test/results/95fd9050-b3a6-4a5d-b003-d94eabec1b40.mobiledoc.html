<p>Superstar <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/musicians-car-collection/">musicians</a> Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello were targeted by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-using-wildlife-cameras/">thieves</a> on March 28 and the couple is now down a Mercedes G-Wagen. This just goes to show no matter how <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/googled-celebrity-collections/">rich and powerful</a> you may be, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-fieris-200k-lamborghini-heist/">criminals will still target you</a> like they do anyone else with a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-steal-chevy-camaro/">vehicle they want</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn how thieves targeted Guy Fieri's $200k Lamborghini <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-fieris-200k-lamborghini-heist/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to a report from TMZ, our most favorite news source, Mendes and Cabello were in their Los Angeles home when thieves broke in through the window. Police say once the suspects realized the couple was home and not in one of their other houses, they grabbed the Mercedes G-Wagen keys and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>That Mercedes G-Class is Mendes’ ride, which the paparazzi has photographed him with many times in the past. Known by many as just being boxy and flashy, most of the wider public isn’t aware of their extreme off-road capabilities. The fact the SUVs are dressed up in chrome and other nice trim, combined with the high cost of models sold in North America, mean pretty much nobody is out hitting the Rubicon or any other trail for fear of damage.</p>
<p>Even though the police were contacted immediately and arrived at the house quickly, the suspects had already taken off. Now an investigation into the break-in and stolen luxury SUV is underway. We know how these stories usually go down. Either the Mercedes is chopped up and being sold piece by piece at the moment, or it was immediately loaded onto a boat bound for an overseas nation. However, the investigation could lead to the breakup of yet another luxury auto theft ring, so some good might come of it.</p>
<p>Since 2020 car theft rates, which were in a decline before, began rising sharply. It’s not just luxury vehicles thieves are targeting, with everything from muscle cars to Kias in their sights. In other words, everyone needs to do whatever they can to secure their vehicle lest they make it too easy to take.</p>
