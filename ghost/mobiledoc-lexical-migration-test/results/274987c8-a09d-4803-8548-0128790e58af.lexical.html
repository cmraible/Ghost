<p>Friends:</p>
<p>When I first asked you to subscribe to TMI, I told you that we would be focused on impact journalism. I told you that we needed subscriber support so that we have the resources to report on corruption in a way that shames the political system into action.</p>
<p>And so with that in mind, I am thrilled to let you know some terrific news:</p>
<p><strong>After TMI’s investigative reporting series, <a href="https://nynow.wmht.org/blogs/health/ny-rolls-back-legal-protections-for-nursing-homes-health-care-facilities/"><strong>Gov. Andrew Cuomo has just signed legislation</strong></a> rolling back parts of New York’s corporate immunity law that we <a href="/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity"><strong>shined a bright spotlight on</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>To know our journalism made a direct impact, just look at how Democratic Assemblyman Ron Kim publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1290456166234021895">lauded</a> TMI’s reporting for playing a pivotal role in forcing Cuomo to take action. Kim publicly credited “TMI’s relentless investigative journalism in uncovering NY’s blanket legal immunity for health care facilities.”</p>
<p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to you for being a TMI supporting subscriber. We could not make this kind of impact without you. I really mean that.</p>
