<p>Even today, some 38 years after its launch, the DeLorean DMC-12 looks like a product of the future. It’s naked brushed stainless-steel body designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and those gullwing doors combine to create an awe-inspiring machine to look at. Even without its starring role in ‘Back to the Future’ that cemented it into pop culture, this Irish-built model is well known around the world.</p>
<p>Sure, its period performance left much to be desired, and the DMC marque sank beneath the waves in a wash of scandal, but the small child that lives in all of us still wants to own one. Listed in the Motorious classifies are some great examples of this iconic John DeLorean model.</p>

<p>If you were captivated by the 1985 movie ‘Back to the Future’, you’re probably looking to live your dream of becoming Marty McFly. This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/4254/1981-delorean-coupe">DMC-12</a> listed with the Orlando Auto Museum has been customised to look just like the movie car. Complete with time circuits and external cladding, this DMC-12 is actually modelled on vehicle from the second movie featuring a Mr Fusion generator.</p>

<p>The 1981 car has covered just shy of 60,000-miles with the advert boasting ‘1,620,000 Hp with the aid of a lightning strike.’</p>
<p>Also listed with the Orlando Auto Museum is this $99,995 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/3818/1981-delorean-coupe">Back to the Future II replica</a>. Your extra cash gets you an even more accurate build of the movie car, with exacting switchgear and glowing flux capacitor. This example is also an automatic car.</p>
<p>If you want to be more visible at night while driving your time machine, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/165627/1981-delorean-dmc-12">Volo Auto Museum</a> has got you covered. Yet another Back to the Future II replica, but this time it hosts neon lighting that bathes its silhouette in an unusual purple shade.</p>

<p>As demonstrated, many DeLoreans have been transformed into Doc Brown’s creation, but if you’re after something truly collectible, Garage Kept Motors is worth a visit. The DMC-12 is famed for its brushed stainless steel skin, but <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/4569/1981-delorean-dmc-12">this example</a> was painted red by its delivering dealer. Extensively restored using DeLorean Motor Company parts in 2013, this manual car has covered just 1671 miles from new. At $42,900 we think its a bit of a bargain considering its mileage and rarity.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a clean and totally standard DMC-12, look no further than this 13,000-mile example listed in our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/156743/1981-delorean-dmc-12">classifieds</a>. It appears utterly immaculate and highlights just what a striking car the DeLorean still is. The combination of a manual gearbox and this car’s low mileage will put it on collector’s radars.</p>
