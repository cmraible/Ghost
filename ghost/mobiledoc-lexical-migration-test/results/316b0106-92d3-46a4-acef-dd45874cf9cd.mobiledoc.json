And while it’s far more likely your ride will be stolen, it’s still scary to see images like these of a parking garage that collapsed just before midnight on May 3. The end result was two cars left hanging by nothing but their front and rear bumpers, plus a huge mess."

Fortunately, nobody was hurt in the accident, but some water pipes burst and started flooding the lower section of the parking structure. When firefighters arrived, they didn’t know if anyone was trapped in the debris, and with water spraying everywhere combing over the area was difficult. A Pontiac below barely escaped getting crushed, something we’re sure the owner appreciates."

He stated something in the structure of the cement gave way, likely due to the wet climate in Ohio combined with temperature swings. In other words, sink holes aren’t the only things that can swallow up you and your car."
