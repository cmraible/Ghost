Naked metal has been polished to give the body an unpainted reflective quality that highlights some design traits previously masked by factory pastel colors. A contrasting gloss black finish for a hood stripe before covering the roof and filling the load bed. The truck’s typically ‘cute’ rounded headlights now also seem demonic, with a yellow lens at its center."
