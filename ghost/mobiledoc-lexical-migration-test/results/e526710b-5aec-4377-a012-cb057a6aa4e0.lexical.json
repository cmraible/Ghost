A young buck strollers into a dealership by himself a beautiful muscle car from the 1970s, drives it until the wheels fall off, and eventually the car ends up rotting in some field. In the case of this particular gentleman, that story hits particularly hard. Originally purchasing the car brand new from the factory, the automobile spent its life driving at high speeds showing off its pretty colors. Eventually it landed where many have seen it today, the owner’s yard.",

All in all, this would have been such an amazing vehicle to be in possession of in its best years end, well some seem quite upset by the cars current state, it seems like it has reached the natural conclusion of its life span.
