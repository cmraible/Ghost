During a recent battle to get my tags/title/registration from a Texas-based dealer, the department caught wind of the dealer runaround, and put the screws on them to get the paperwork processed after months of fighting. So with that personal anecdote being shared, it’s not surprising to me that the state is cracking down on the abuse of temporary tags after some dealers were found to be misusing them.",
