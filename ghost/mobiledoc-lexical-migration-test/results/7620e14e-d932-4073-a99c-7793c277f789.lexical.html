<p><a href="https://www.tapkat.org/auburn-cord-duesenberg-automobile-museum/xEezmk?promo=MOTDEC">1963 marked</a> the first year for the generation that would go on to be referred to as the mid-year Corvettes. Despite implications of mediocrity created by this name, the second generation Corvette was anything but. In fact, many enthusiasts believe that 1963 through 1967 model years are among the best for America’s Sports Car.</p>
