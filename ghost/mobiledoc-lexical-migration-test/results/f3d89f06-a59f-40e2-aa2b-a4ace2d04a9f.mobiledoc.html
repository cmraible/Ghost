<h3 id="googles-approach-to-product-reviews">Google's approach to product reviews</h3>
<p>A couple of days ago, I linked to some news about Google updating how it will index reviews. <em>Digiday</em> has taken a deeper look at it, and to me, it looks like good news, but others clearly disagree:</p>
<blockquote>Google said it will prioritize product reviews that feature information gathered through hands-on evaluation of the product, rather than aggregated information about it. The move stands to hurt publishers, especially those that have found success in aggregating product reviews.</blockquote>
<p>So, Google is prioritising high quality, researched work over rapid aggregation of free low-quality content from the web? I know that this piece is trying to spin this as bad news, but I don't see it:</p>
<blockquote>But it will also make commerce content more time- and resource-intensive to produce, said executives at several publishers with commerce content operations, so much so that it could make expanding into new product categories prohibitively expensive; well-researched, in-depth product reviews “are a hard operation to scale,” a source at a second publisher said.</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes. Anyone who has been paying attention for the past 15 years will know that successful search-based techniques of low-quality content driving revenue tend to have a short shelf-life. Google will eventually penalise them. I'm struggling to find sympathy for publishers making such a basic mistake.</p>
