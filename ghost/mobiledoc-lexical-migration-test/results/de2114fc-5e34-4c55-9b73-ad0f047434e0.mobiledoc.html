<p>When it <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933">comes to Dodge</a>, most enthusiastâ€™s minds go straight to the muscle car era. There is a good reason for this. In a time when many automakers were trying to distance the muscle car from the race scene, Dodge was embracing it. They knew that a large portion of Dodge sales were dependent on the fact that their cars could be seen as lightweight powerful machines with a singular utility and they harped on that with models such as the Charger, Challenger, and certain variants of the Coronet. Although, Dodge was not just about speed. While these powerful Mopar models occupied the minds of the mainstream customer, <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933">Dodge split its focus </a>towards another class of vehicle that helped set a standard for other auto manufacturers to live up to.</p>

<p>As the first mass-produced 4x4 medium duty truck, the <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933">Dodge Power Wagon</a> set the course for the modern era of trucks. With competition from Ford and GMC, the Power Wagon continued to evolve and in 1961 it featured a 251-cid flathead inline-six engine, a 4-speed manual transmission, and a 2-speed part-time 4-wheel drive with power take off that could be used to power auxiliary equipment. Utility was the name of the game and the<a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933"> Dodge Power Wagon</a> was a dominating force back in the day, but today these trucks are pretty rare.</p>
