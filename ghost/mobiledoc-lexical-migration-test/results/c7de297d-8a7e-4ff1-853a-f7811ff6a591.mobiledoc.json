The rumor is that the car was manufactured mainly to bring Richard Petty back to Plymouth after he left to race for Ford in 1968. Powering the Superbird was the top-of-the-line 426-cubic-inch (7.0-liter) Hemi engine fed by two four-barrel Carter AFB carburetors, a setup that generated 425-horsepower and allowed the car to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Built with aerodynamics in mind, the car had a protruding nosecone and a massive high-mounted rear wing. "

While notes from Chrysler from September 1969 show that that the sales programming staff were ready to handle 1,920 winged Plymouths, published numbers are conflicting and show 2,783 Superbirds were built. The widely accepted number is 1,935 Superbirds built and transported within the United States with between 34 to 47 sent to Canada. Even the power option numbers are questionable, but it is reported that 135 Superbirds were built with a Hemi, 716 were powered by the six-barrel 440-cubic-invh V8, and the rest were 440ci 4bbl cars. Only a little over 1,000 Plymouth Superbirds are believed to actually exist today."
