<p>Ammo NYC nearly broke the internet when it posted a video of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-bizzarrini-p538-barn-find-take-a-bath/">Bizzarini</a> tucked among an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">epic 300-car barn find collection</a> of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic cars</a>, and now the detailing company is back in the same warehouse to give a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1967-corvette-restored/">1967 Chevrolet Corvette</a> its first car wash in 33 years. The Corvette in question is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/big-block-1967-chevrolet-corvette-restored-to-factory-condition/">427 cubic-inch Sting Ray</a> coupe that seems to be in pretty good shape other than the dirt caked onto the paint and the interior covered in mold and mildew.</p>

<p>Tucked in between a 1956-57 Corvette and a 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-dodge-charger-scat-pack-widebody-review/">Dodge Charger</a> 500, this uncovered Corvette had definitely attracted plenty of dirt and grime over the years. When the 'Vette was first pulled out, the weathered and stained paint, pitted chrome and filthy interior made it look like a full restoration might be necessary.</p>
<p>The interior received a deep cleaning from a steamer bringing life back into the seats and steering wheel, while the car's exterior was cleaned and polished as much as possible without damaging the original paint. There are still flaws in the paint, but getting any more aggressive with the compound would go too far and would required a repaint. For instances when original paint is important, this job is about as perfect as one could get.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the process of detailing such a specimen is a time-consuming ordeal. With two detailers, this project took almost eight hours to complete, but the final result is incredible.</p>
