Fisher admits that he wasn't diligent enough when he paid $250,000 for the Gulf-liveried Ford GT40 replica being sold by Tuttle, and then never heard from him again. When local police started investigating Tuttle, they found him in an Indiana jail, and he was extradited to Michigan. His bond was set at $200,000, and a probable cause hearing is scheduled for December 19th."
