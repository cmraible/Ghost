<p>Air suspension has become increasingly popular over the years, and it seems like there is no slowing down. Not only is it mainly used on those draggin' mini trucks to get that perfected slammed look, air suspension can be found across the board in all automotive categories in custom builds such as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/restomods-on-motorious/">restomods</a>, motorcycles, and now, exotics. Of course, car builds were meant to suit each individual car owner and their own particular tastes. But - we must ask - when has it gone too far in your own personal opinion? Would you buy a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/clapton-ferraris/">Ferrari</a> on air bags? This <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1745632775574937/">bagged 1991 Ferrari 348 TS</a> is for sale.</p>

<p>Here we have a 1991 Ferrari 348 TS that sits on a custom Air Ride setup that was listed for sale on Facebook in the group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1474086929500025">Bagged Trucks For Sale or Trade ONLY</a>. Like many builds that want that slammed appearance but adjustable drivability, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1982-ferrari-magnum-pi/">Ferrari's</a> height can be adjusted to raise up and back to the ground when desired. All original stock parts come with the car so the suspension can be changed back if someone isn't interested in the air setup. </p>
<p>The beauty of air is that the suspension is that there is no set height for the car for it is easily adjusted by using a compressor or an air pump powered by an electric or engine to fill flexible bellows, or bags, with pressurized air. The bellows (bags) are inflated which lifts the chassis from the axle. One can roll over that speed bump with ease with by simply adjusting the suspension.</p>
<p>This is one of those cars that may leave <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/grandma-stashes-two-exotics-in-garage/">exotic car</a> purists with sweaty palms as many exotic car enthusiasts usually leave them as is from the factory. With rear-wheel-drive and a 5-speed manual, the car is powered by as mid-engine V8 and can reach a top speed of 171 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Other highlights of this two-seater <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ferrari-f40-burns-to-the-ground/">Ferrari</a> include Legacy forged billet wheels, a clean and clear title, about 50,000 miles on the clock. The only thing that doesn't work as it should is the rear e-brake. The seller has listed the car at $59,000 on Facebook. Located in Greensboro, North Carolina, the car can be arranged for shipping.</p>
