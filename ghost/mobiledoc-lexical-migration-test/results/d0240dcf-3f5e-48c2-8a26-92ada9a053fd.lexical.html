<hr>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mecum-eddie-vannoy-collection-auction/">Eddie Vannoy</a> amassed an incredible collection of vehicles that were auctioned off this week through <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/elvis-presley-driven-ford-roadster/">Mecum</a>, and it turns out being delayed by almost a month did nothing to slow down bidding. The amazing variety of cars had buyers acting like kids in a candy store with a total of 55 cars, trucks and SUVs being sold off (only four vehicles didn't sell) for a total of almost $7.1 million â€“ and that doesn't even include the equally incredible automobilia that was up for grabs. The top nine highest-priced cars alone all exceeded their pre-auction estimates selling for a collective $1.7 million, and they were a shining example of how vastly diverse Vannoy's collection was ranging from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classics </a>to modern vehicles, bone stock to custom <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/restomod/">restomods</a>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, a winged warrior was the top-selling car from this group with the red 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona selling for $231,000, while the red 1970 Plymouth Superbird's sale price of $203,500 was about $50,000 more than initially expected. Hammering for more than the Superbird, the coolest vehicle, without a doubt, auctioned off was a 1941 Kenworth fire truck that sold for $209,000. The Art Deco design is incredible, but the more impressive part of this fire truck is that only five of these were ever built. A gorgeous LS3-powered 1967 Corvette restomod was the only other vehicle to break the $200,000 mark with a sale price of $200,750.</p>
<p>At this auction, $187,000 hammer prices took home two totally different cars ranging from a beautiful, Hemi-powered 1971 Plymouth 'Cuda restomod to a brand-new 2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 with just 140 actual miles. A show-winning, custom-built 1941 Dodge Power Wagon was the seventh highest-priced vehicle of this auction with a sale price of $176,000, while a 1958 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible ($143,000) and 1970 Buick GSX ($140,800) rounded out the top nine.</p>
<p>A pair of Chevrolet restomod trucks could have just as easily crashed this list as well with custom versions of a 1967 C10 and a 1972 Blazer failing to sell with high bids of $190,000 and $175,000, respectively.</p>
