This cluster of thefts is not isolated to the state, as car thieves are emboldened across the country, a trend we’ve witnessed growing since 2020. If you own a tow truck, especially an older model, they are targeting your vehicle as a way to steal other cars."

Thieves are targeting trucks without security features and remote starts. They’re also using some kind of equipment to rip out the locks to get inside."
