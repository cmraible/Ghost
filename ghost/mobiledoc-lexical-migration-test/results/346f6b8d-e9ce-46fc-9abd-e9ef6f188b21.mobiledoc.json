Rated at a peak 430-horsepower and 450 lb.-ft. of torque, It’s plenty to handle in the lightweight pony car. Backing up that engine is a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission, which at least does eliminate driver error in rowing through the gears (but we prefer manuals, not gonna lie). Coming in at 3,300 lbs., the different lightweighting techniques used in the factory have definitely helped keep this machine lean and mean."

Usually he’s really thorough plus he loads all kinds of witty banter in when going over specs at the beginning, but this time around the video is without banter and that information. It’s still interesting to see these two muscle cars race, so check out the video."
