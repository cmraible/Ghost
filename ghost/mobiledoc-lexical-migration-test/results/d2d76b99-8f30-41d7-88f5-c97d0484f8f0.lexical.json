Cars from that era have been increasing in popularity as they are fall even further into classic territory with each passing day. One of the cars from that time is the mid-engine 1985 Pontiac Fiero GT. Carlisle Auctions is excited to offer this radical example to anyone wanting to bring back the mid-'80s in utmost style. Online and Phone Bidding is available for this sale. ",
