<p>Ah, I love <a href="http://nextconf.eu/">NEXT</a>. Unlike many tech-based conferences, which are very rooted in the now, they have a remarkable knack of looking about two years into the future, and giving you a sense of what the world might look like then. Iâ€™ve been working with them since January, and itâ€™s one of the pieces of work I enjoy the most. Hereâ€™s all the liveblogging I did for them earlier in the month:</p>
