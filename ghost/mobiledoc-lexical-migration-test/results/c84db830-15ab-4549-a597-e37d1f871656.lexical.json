While the original car had t-tops, Chris had to buy a hardtop Trans Am because the t-top models were notorious for leaking which led to accelerated rusting of the floorboards. Upon obtaining the car Chris immediately went to work converting the roof of the Trans Am to a t-top. Over the course of 2000 hours, the car was built up until it finally met the K.I.T.T. standards. One of the coolest parts of this build is the front bumper, while other replicas almost always have an issue with the front bumper Chris was determined to get it right. He eventually got his buddy to agree to sculpt him a custom front bumper and used Photoshop to overlay the images of the new bumper with the original K.I.T.T. bumper to get every angle perfect.",
