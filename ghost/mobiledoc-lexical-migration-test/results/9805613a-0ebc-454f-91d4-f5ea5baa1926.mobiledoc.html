<p>Sometimes people do <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-man-crashes-dodge-charger/">crazy things behind the wheel of a car</a> and they later <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/turbocharged-bagged-general-lee/">live to regret it</a>, if they’re lucky. Recently, a California driver traveling on Highway 99 in Modesto launched their sedan into the air in a stunt that looks like something straight out of <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-lenos-garage-general-lee/">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em>. Unlike the incident authorities tried to put the lid on in Detroit where a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-goes-full-dukes-of-hazzard/">driver purposely jumped a retracting drawbridge</a>, this stunt seems to be a complete accident and not intentionally at all.</p>

<p>Luckily the stunt was caught on camera, otherwise people would say it never happened. After all, we live in the age of everyone carrying a phone with a camera embedded in it, not to mention cameras on cars and buildings, so the craziness <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">is often captured</a> and easily shared through social media.</p>
<p>According to the California Highway Patrol, the driver in this incident, who hasn’t been identified, was distracted while traveling down Highway 99. The car veered off the highway and up a grassy embankment before launching into the air. With the sun shining behind the trees behind the car jump, the whole thing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lykan-hypersport-fast-furious/">almost looks picturesque</a>.</p>

<p>In all honesty, there’s little that’s funny about this incident. Thankfully, the driver only sustained minor injuries, but it could’ve been so much worse. Every year, people are killed when they drive distracted, not to mention innocent people are killed by distracted drivers.</p>
<p>CHP took this opportunity to remind people they need to be paying attention to what’s going on around them at all times while driving, even on a straight stretch of highway they drive every day. Drivers also need to keep their hands on the steering wheel, otherwise something like this could happen, only the landing might not be nearly as graceful.</p>
