Chrysler teased about the design  elements of the car through concepts that included the Dodge Diamante  and Super Charger. Both of the teaser concepts sported the electrically  actuated, variable pitch rear wings that could be adjusted from the  cockpit enabling the driver to adapt to different driving conditions -  adjustable via the cockpit to allow the driver to adapt the wing."

The Charger’s air-grabber cold air intake flap is a  familiar piece among Mopar fans, but sports the originally designed  shark tooth fang."
