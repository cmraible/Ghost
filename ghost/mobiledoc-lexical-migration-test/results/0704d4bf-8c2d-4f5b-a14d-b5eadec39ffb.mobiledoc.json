Every inch of this car in perfectly clean including under the hood, and even the VIN tag is in amazing condition! It's getting increasingly difficult to find a Packard in this good of shape these days (unless it's wearing a six-figure price tag, that is), but this gorgeous 1947 Packard Custom Super Clipper is ready for anything whether it's a long-distance CCCA CARavan or winning awards at car shows."

          "The Packard Clipper was introduced in 1941 including a truncated 1942 model year, but production was interrupted by America's involvement in World War II. The Clipper line picked back up for 1946, and fortunately no major changes were made to the design. The most stylish elements of this car are those massive front fenders that are sculpted into the body design and stretch half way into the front doors, while the faired-in rear wheels and the wrap-around chrome grille are other eye-catching details. The two-tone interior looks stunning, and it shows why Packard was a luxury leader in its day."
