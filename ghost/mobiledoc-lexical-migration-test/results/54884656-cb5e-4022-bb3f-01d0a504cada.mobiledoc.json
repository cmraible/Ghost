Thanks to the coronavirus lockdowns, thieves have more time to stake out your ride and figure out when to swipe it. However, there’s a great device which will stop most of these entitled thugs from stealing your ride: a manual transmission."

          "Last year, Volkswagen put out a hilarious commercial about a couple of younger guys out on the town in a new VW Jetta GLI. They’re talking about music while finding a parking spot on the street in what could be just about any city in North America. After parking, the passenger asks the driver, “aren’t you going to lock the car?” The driver responds, “nah, it’s a stick shift.” That’s when we realize the genius of the commercial."

This commercial also triggered plenty of whiny people, including a particular car site that whined about how leaving a car unlocked wasn’t a good idea – bet they’re real fun at parties. Well, VW caved like a cheap wedding cake and took the video off "
