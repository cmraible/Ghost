On one side of the equation you can clearly see a beautiful 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am in pretty  good condition. Looking to the other, we find a 1970 Pontiac GTO which has some of the rarest features ever put  to use in a muscle car. Both of these vehicles are proud members of the same brand and as such have a lot in common but it is also funny how they seem to fill in the gaps for each other in a lot of ways.",

Luckily, sitting in the garage of this automotive enthusiast is a beautifully kept and well-maintained 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Cars like this are the epitome of a great pony car as they combine a smaller stature with the best powertrain options available in their time. This particular Firebird is loaded with some of the best options out there which is why it had a price of around $11,000 back in the day, as confirmed by various paperwork in the car.",

            "text": "To the side of that legendary Firebird is a 1970 Pontiac GTO coated in a stunning Baja Gold which combines with the dark gold top to make a very rare appearance. On top of that, the vehicle also sports the RAM AIR III package with the original headers laying around on the  garage floor. Finally, the A/C in this car was a factory option that only came in around 20 RAM AIR III optioned cars in its time. Essentially, Dennis Collins thinks this is a one of one car because of all the different options which may very well be true. Either way this is a very cool set of classic cars that perfectly complement each other with performance and style and we hope to see them back on the road once again.",
