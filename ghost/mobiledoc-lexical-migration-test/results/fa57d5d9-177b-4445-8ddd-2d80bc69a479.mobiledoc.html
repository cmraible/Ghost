<p>Welcome to Motorious’ <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1972-harley-davidson-aermacchi-350-sprint/">Motorcycle Monday</a>, where we highlight an interesting ride from our inventory for your consideration. If you’re a fan of big cruiser <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/motorcycle/">motorcycles</a> but aren’t so keen on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/is-harley-davidson-on-its-last-leg/">Harley-Davidson</a>, or you’re just looking for a solid deal, this Yamaha Road Star XV17AS/C is definitely worth looking over. It has that classic look so many love, plus it’s renowned for being a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorcycle-monday-1991-honda-nighthawk-walking-dead-tribute/">low-hassle and low-cost ride</a> to keep around.</p>
<p>White fenders and fuel tank are offset by plenty of black and chrome trim, so no one element is absolutely dominating the appearance. Some people want a sinister ride, but this one will appeal to someone wanting more balance.  You’ll note the large headlight is flanked by two spot lamps, which are both LEDs.</p>
<p>Onboard is a 1670cc V-Twin carbureted engine backed by a five-speed transmission. This motorcycle is well-known for being low-maintenance, so if you’re looking for a ride that won’t give you much grief, this one could be a good fit. The Vance & Hines exhaust isn’t overly loud, and everyone has an opinion on whether that’s good or not.</p>
<p>As is the case with any cruiser, this Yamaha has been built for comfort even on the longest rides at highway speeds. That’s evident with the broad and well-padded mustang seat, plus the fact there are rider and passenger floorboards (they’re adjustable for the passenger). The passenger also gets a backrest. A heel-toe shifter makes life simpler for the rider. Located on both sides, the saddlebags are lockable, so you can stow what you need without worry. A luggage rack in the rear allows you to carry more gear, like sleeping bags or a small tent, making this a more practical weekend getaway vehicle.</p>
<p>It’s always refreshing when you see a dealer who’s upfront about the condition of a vehicle. That’s exactly the approach <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/inventory/dealer/American+Motorcycle+Trading+Company">American Motorcycle Trading Company</a> takes with this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/195544/2004-yamaha-road-star-xv17as-c">2004 Yamaha Road Star XV17AS/C</a>. Instead of going on about how it’s in perfect condition, they highlight how the bike has some chips and scratches as well as a dent in the front fender. The kickstand is also slightly bent. This Yamaha has definitely been ridden, as the 47,851 miles on the odometer attest, so it comes at a lower price than some might be expecting.</p>
