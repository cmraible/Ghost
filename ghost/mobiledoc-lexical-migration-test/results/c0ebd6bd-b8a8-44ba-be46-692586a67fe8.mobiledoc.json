While only 25 were produced the car was still around long enough to become an instant classic and the limited production numbers equate to high value due to rarity. This particular car is a Torpedo Convertible Coupe, only 6 of which were produced with the disappearing top. While one of only six sounds rare our next addition will astonish and amaze you. Five out of the six cars produced utilized a short wheelbase while one came equipped with a longer wheelbase. This is that one car!

While this manufacturer sponsorship was completely unofficial, these claims are well documented and substantiated by registration papers listing Duntov as Cunningham's co-driver. After testing at Daytona, a shot at the 12-Hour Of Sebring, and a trial at Le Mans, chassis number 3535 was entered into the 24-Hours Of Le Mans with Cunningham and Duntov as registered drivers. However, not wanting to risk losing Duntov to an accident, Cole instructed Cunningham to not let Duntov drive in the race. This turned out to be a good move as the race was interrupted by rain, causing Duntov’s replacement to lose control of the car. Luckily no one was injured and the car was imported back to the U.S."
