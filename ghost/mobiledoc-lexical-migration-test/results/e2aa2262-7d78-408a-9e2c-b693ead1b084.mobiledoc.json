        "html": "<p>Having purchased my first Macintosh computer a couple of months back, it seems that hardly a day has gone by where I haven&#8217;t stumbled upon or been recommended a handy application or utility to make my Mac experience all the more enjoyable.  In fact, one of the things that I&#8217;ve quickly come to love about the Macintosh atmosphere is the number of self-driven &#8220;indie&#8221; developers who work on their own (or as part of smaller startups) to create <em>really </em>useful software.</p>\n<p>By steering clear of the traditional structure of large and oppressive software companies, I have personally found that many of these indie developers are able to develop unique and out-of-the box apps that simply are not seen from larger companies.  This is one of the reasons that I love the Mac App Store, as it makes it that much easier for such applications to be found and distributed.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Now, being a <em>new </em>Mac user, I have yet to find an app that every other Mac user around me hadn&#8217;t already seen or used themselves.  The gems that I find on my own are often met with responses like &#8220;You didn&#8217;t know about that?&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I love that app!&#8221;  Yesterday though I came across a very interesting application known as &#8220;Fluid&#8221;, and much to my surprise was met with virtual blank stares from people who hand&#8217;t a clue what I was talking about.</p>\n<p>In basic, Fluid is an application that allows users to create what is more or less a mini web browser configured to display a specific webpage or web application.  What sets Fluid aside from features such as Google Chrome&#8217;s &#8220;application shortcuts&#8221; is the fact that it creates an actual Mac application to wrap the website frame in.  This means that it can be pinned to the OS X dock for quick and easy access any time, making it a must-have for those of us who would normally keep a tab open in our web browsers to keep up-to-the-minute with our favorite social networks and websites.</p>\n<p>The developer behind this awesome application is <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/itod\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Ditchendorf</a>, a former employee of a &#8220;well-known Fruit Company based in Cupertino&#8221;, previously worked on designing the Dashboard utility and Dashboard Widgets for the Mac OS X operating system.  With this in mind, it should come as no surprise that the application in question is dead-simple to use and the mini applications in which it generates are rock-solid and equally simple.</p>\n<p>Opening the main application simply asks for the URL of the website that you&#8217;d like to create an application for, as well as the name that you would like to give it.  You&#8217;re also able to select an image file to use as the icon, however the application can also grab the &#8220;favicon&#8221; file for the website and use <em>that </em>as the icon.  I personally tried this with the IRCCloud service yesterday evening and was impressed with how simple the process was.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fluid_create.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9150\" title=\"fluid_create\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fluid_create-300x183.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2011/05/fluid_create-300x183.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2011/05/fluid_create.png 595w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>And like magic, I had a new &#8220;application&#8221; on my Mac only a few seconds later.  Lo and behold, said application gave me a seamless view of the site I selected and sat beautifully on my dock.  Even the favicon that it downloaded had scaled wonderfully.  I&#8217;m no entirely sure <em>how </em>this was done, as favicons are typically very small files.  My personal guess was that the image was re-rendered or re-sketeched as a vector image to allow for better scalability, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure either way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fluid_icons.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9152\" title=\"fluid_icons\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fluid_icons.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"187\" height=\"113\" /></a></p>\n<p>While the basic application is free, there is a paid version priced at $4.99 which allows for users to have Fluid store its cookies independently from Safari and use <a href=\"http://userscripts.org/tags/fluid\" target=\"_blank\">custom scripts</a> and themes to manipulate some websites.  Being a &#8220;coffee-cup app&#8221; (that is, an app that costs about the same as a good cup of coffee), I found that it was worth the price for me.  Having said this, I often times end up doing light web design work for my office that requires me to clear my cache and cookies to test, and the functionality of scripts is a very promising feature for me in Fluid.  And of course I think that the developer definitely deserves compensation for his work.</p>\n<p>So far I&#8217;ve had nothing but wonderful experiences with Fluid.  It does the job and it does it well.  One of the things that I&#8217;ve personally discovered is that you can use the mobile version of a given website by either using the mobile URL (e.g. &#8220;m.somesite.com&#8221;) to generate the &#8220;app&#8221;, or using Fluid&#8217;s built-in user-agent spoofer.  Either way allows you to browse a handful of large websites with a more minimal (and often ad-free) interface; all from the convenience of my dock.</p>\n<p>All in all I highly suggest that Mac users look into using Fluid.  It&#8217;s an amazing program, and I think that it&#8217;s well worth the $4.99.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
