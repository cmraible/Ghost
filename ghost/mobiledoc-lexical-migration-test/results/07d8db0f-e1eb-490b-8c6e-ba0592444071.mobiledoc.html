<p>PowerA is known for making some officially licensed third-party controllers for the Nintendo Switch, and now it seems as though they are making some GameCube styled controllers.</p>

<p>These controllers appear to be wireless, being charged by either a USB-C or Micro-USB plugin, and look quite authentic to the originals (aside from also having an L button – which makes sense).</p>
<p>Officially licensed by Nintendo, these controllers are most likely in lead up to Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo Switch, and will be pretty awesome to play with if you don’t own one of those GameCube adapters for the Wii U.</p>
