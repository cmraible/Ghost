In the ‘60s these vehicles were the epitome of freedom as hippies everywhere could now live by their own terms. Decades later, we still think of these priceless artifacts of history as legends of their time with many enthusiasts wondering if they should pick one up for themselves. After all, they certainly haven't lost what made them cool in the first place."

A bright metallic shine  fills the room where this photoshoot was held, complimented further by the wheels. Those wheels are, of course, wrapped in a set of white wall tires showing off the vehicle's age perfectly without making it look “old” or worn out. All of this combines to make one good looking van with all the style you might expect from the early 1970s."

          ", the interior is also specced out for riding around with your crew in style with a very spacious rear area. This bed space features some comfortable bench seating fit for chilling out and enjoying the drive. Speaking of enjoying the drive, this automobile is controlled by a four-speed manual transmission which is clearly going to be a lot of fun to use despite the vehicle's obvious weight and size. Basically, this bus is everything you could possibly want in a road tripper from the 1970s and you should  definitely consider it if you're on the market for a Volkswagen."
