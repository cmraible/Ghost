While it’s shocking to see a criminal pull off such a stunt, what’s even worse is that Seattle police just stood there and watched him drive off. This is what passes for law enforcement in Washington’s biggest city."

Several police vehicles are parked in the road with their emergency lights activated as the officers congregate by the curb. They don’t even approach the German sports car, which then drives down the sidewalk uninhibited, then merges into traffic."

Due to the extreme risk pursuits create, we will always err on the side of safety for everyone in our community. We will catch the suspect another day.” Sure they will, unless he choose to run away again and you just watch, hanging your heads in shame. What a sad place Seattle has become."
