<hr>
<p>In a time when the word "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/supercar/">supercar</a>" was still relegated solely to high-end European <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/sports/">sports cars</a>, California-based Vector Aeromotive began to question that stereotype with its wedge-shaped, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-c8-corvette/">mid-engine</a> offering, the Vector W8. After only 17 customer-intent W8s and 14 of the M12 model, Vector had lost funding by 1996, but this company had some big plans in store according to a <em>Motor Authority</em> interview with former Vector designer Michael Santoro.</p>

<p>Had the M12 production run gone as planned, Vector's parent company at the time, Indonesia-based MegaTech, had the designs for three more cars to grow the brand. The next car, and probably the most realistic of the bunch, would have been just a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1973-porsche-911-targa/">targa</a> version of the M12 featuring a removable roof panel and a strengthened chassis, but things could have gotten real interesting following this proposed M12 Targa.</p>
<p>Looking to grab a slightly larger market share of the supercar market, a 2+2 grand touring convertible was planned with a price far less than the W8 and M12. The craziest of the bunch was a proposed pickup <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/trucks/">truck </a>with an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/el-camino-rendering/">El Camino</a>-meets-supercar vibe featuring a small, open cargo area with its 2+2 seating and mid-engine design. In stark contrast to the high-speed Vectors that might have preceded it, this vehicle had an open concept with an exposed frame/roll cage, a small cargo bed and minimalist doors.</p>
