<h3 id="low-miles-and-a-well-documented-history-make-this-c3-vette-a-rare-find">Low miles and a well-documented history make this C3 'Vette a rare find.</h3>
<p>The attraction of the <a href="https://www.autoclassics.com/tag/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> is the fact that is an everyday sports car, which means that over the years, many of these 'Vettes have lived rough lives and suffered unenviable fates. That definitely isn't the case with this particular <a href="https://corvettemikemidwest.com/used-corvettes-for-sale/1974-corvette-coupe-documented-with-low-miles/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">1974 Chevrolet Corvette</a>, which shows impressively thanks to a two-owner past and extremely low miles. If you're looking for a high-quality Corvette, this one being sold through <a href="https://corvettemikemidwest.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike Midwest</a> is the way to go.</p>

<p>While it's not impossible to find a C3 'Vette in good shape these days, you're probably not going to find many better than this one. This Corvette is in amazing condition thanks largely to the car having less than 40,000 miles on the odometer, which is verified with a notarized mileage confirmation. Add in a well-documented history with just two owners since new, and it's easy to see why this Corvette is still in such impressive condition after all these years.</p>
<p>Built from 1968 through 1982, the C3 generation of Corvettes are among the most underappreciated 'Vettes out there, but they're arguably among the most stylish as well thanks to those large, sweeping fenders. This Corvette received one repaint years ago refreshing the Classic White exterior paint, and this color is perfectly complemented by the saddle tan leather interior. One interesting part of this Corvette is that the urethane bumpers were upgraded to fiberglass, which means you won't see the fading or cracking of plastic-bumpered C3 'Vettes.</p>
<p>The more you look at, in and under this Corvette, the more impressed you'll be at its condition. The 350 CID V8 is nestled into an amazingly clean engine compartment, while the undercarriage shows just how pampered this Corvette's life has been.</p>
