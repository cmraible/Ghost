<hr>
<p>If you’ve watched <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-how-amalgam-collection-model-cars-are-made/">Shmee150 on YouTube</a> before, you know the guy is a big fan of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/youtuber-drives-supercars/">European supercars</a> and hypercars. Oh, he does own a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/manhart-dials-up-toyota-supra-performance/">2020 Toyota Supra</a> (which, let’s be honest, is European) and two Ford Focus RS models (also pretty much European). The YouTuber has a pretty <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/tour-some-virtual-auto-museums/">narrow range</a> when it comes to his garage, but with over 2 million subscribers we’d argue it’s working out great for him. But the guy went out on a limb recently, taking a new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-crashed/">Dodge Challenger 392 Scat Pack</a> Widebody for a spin to check out the American muscle car. Oh, and he hits 174 mph during his drive.</p>
<p>Before you jump to conclusions, Shmee150 is in Europe and he takes the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">powerful muscle car</a> on the Autobahn, allowing him to hit those kinds of speeds without getting in trouble with the law. Honestly, it’s kind of like watching a 12 year-old ride a bucking bronco for the first time after they’ve gotten used to well-trained Arabians. In other words, you really have to watch the video.</p>
<p>In Euro spec, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/lock-up-charger-challenger/">Mopar muscle car</a> is putting out just shy of 500-horsepower. That’s pretty good, but if only Shmee could get behind the wheel of a Hellcat. Still, it’s good for the man to get outside of his comfort zone and have a close encounter with American automotive testosterone for a change. Really, everyone should, especially those who can’t help but constantly criticize it online.</p>
<p>While Mopar muscle cars are common in North America, they’re more of an exotic thing in Europe. Sure, you can find them, but you’re not going to see them all over the place. Dodge hasn’t been aggressive in its marketing for that section of the world, leaving the Ford Mustang to eat up most of the demand for American performance cars.</p>
