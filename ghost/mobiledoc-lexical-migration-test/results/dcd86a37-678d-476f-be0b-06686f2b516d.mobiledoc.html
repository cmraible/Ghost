<hr>
<p>The best thing about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ls-powered-vehicles-on-motorious/">Chevrolet's LS engine</a> is that you can stuff it under the hood of just about any car imaginable including a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/s-swapped-lamborghini-diablo/">Lamborghini Diablo</a>, and if you're considering an LS swap for your next project, be sure to check out the all-new LS427 crate engine from Chevrolet Performance. As its name suggests, this crate engine is an <strong>LS</strong> V8 with a <strong>427</strong> cubic-inch displacement and <strong>570</strong>-horsepower output.</p>

<p>Although it is based on the 7.0-liter LS7 V8 used in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/is-the-corvette-z06-the-best-sports-car-you-can-buy/">C6 Corvette</a> and 2014-15 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hendrick-camaro/">Camaro </a>Z/28, this engine differs from the production V8 with a unique high-lift camshaft, high-rate valve springs, CNC-ported heads, low-profile fuel-injected intake manifold, forged steel crank, titanium rods and a wet-sump oiling system with an aluminum oil pan. These beefed-up components help increase the LS7's tune from 505 hp and 481 lb-ft of torque in the Z/28 up to 570 hp at 6,200 rpm and 540 lb-ft of torque at 4,800 rpm (on premium-grade pump gas!), and the engine redline is 7,000 rpm. </p>
<blockquote>“The all-new LS427/570 builds on the legendary, racing-bred performance of the LS7 to create the most powerful naturally-aspirated LS crate engine in [Chevrolet's] portfolio.”</blockquote>
<p>The LS427/570 crate engine must be used with a special engine computer, which is sold separately. The good news is that this engine is available right now through <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/381061/chevrolet-performance-new-crate-engine">Chevrolet Performance</a> dealers, but the bad news is that this engine is intended for "competition use only" indicating that it isn't street legal.</p>
<p>Chevrolet did not announce how much this crate engine will cost, but rest assured, it will be far less than the $191,000 price that someone just paid for a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1967-lamborghini-miura-engine-auction/">1967 Lamborghini Miura V12 engine</a>!</p>
