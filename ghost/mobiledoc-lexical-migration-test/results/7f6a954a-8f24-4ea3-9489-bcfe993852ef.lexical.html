<p>And very interesting it looks too. As described, it’s both a place to blog yourself and to gather stories from the paper. A workspace? A social network? A bit of both? From the looks of the pics on Flickr it resembles a blog-centric social network, like <a href="http://www.vox.com">Vox</a>. But Shane’s not giving too many details.</p>
<p>It certainly has the makings of a significant expansion of a major national newspaper into the user-generated content field, although the legal ramifications of all this blogging under the Telegraph’s name must have given them pause for thought.</p>
<p>But, worries aside, it could also be the idea that triggers mainstream adoption of blogging by the British public. And that’s pretty damn exciting.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
