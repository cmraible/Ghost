<p>Check out this barn find condition <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1966-lincoln-continental/">Lincoln</a> Model L. Peeling, crazed, dimpled paint, imperfections in the chrome, a faded interior do not detract from this automobile, but instead add to its originality and charm.

<p>Here is a a car from an era where status was measured by the inch, and net worth was shown off by the amount of chrome that could be attached to a car. This car has both the length and the chrome, so its original owner was probably an important person, and had the scratch to back it up.</p>

<p>Purchased from the former owner/curator for the past 36 years here in Missouri, this very well preserved car remained nearly 100% original throughout upon acquisition. Although, the original interior upholstery had survived rather well being covered in plastic for many years, we felt this extremely rare Imperial deserved a new interior. It was completely removed in late 2015 and professional refinished by our very own Danny Slivinski here in-house.</p>

<p>This 1925 V-63 Phaeton is a rarely-seen example of Cadillacâ€™s technological tour de force. According to factory records, this car left the factory on the 21st of May, 1924, destined for Munger Auto Co. of Dallas, Texas. Copies of the original ledger show the first owner was J.A. Russell, also of Dallas. This car remained in Texas for nearly all of its life, trading hands early on to Earnest McCanless, another local resident, who owned the car from the mid-1920s through 1942, when he sold it to Charles Gharis. In 1966, Gharis sold the Cadillac to Charles Matthews of Waxahachie, Texas who restored the big V-63 and enjoyed it for many years. In the 1970s, Matthews parked the Cadillac in his barn, and it remained there until after his passing. In 2010, the Campbell family (also of Texas) acquired the Cadillac from the Matthews estate and treated it to a high-quality cosmetic restoration including a new top, interior, and restored artillery wheels.</p>
