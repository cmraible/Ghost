More than 75-percent of all Camaros sold that year were V8-powered and almost 25-percent were the top-of-the-line Z/28 and SS models. Buyers had realized that they could get a better built, more powerful sports car for less. Even when comparing apples to apples the Z/28 was relatively equally balanced with the Boss 302 but cost quite a bit less."

This is where things get a bit subjective but immaculate examples like this one being offered at Mecum’s upcoming Las Vegas event makes a good point for the classic F-Body. Finished in a shiny Orange paint with Black Rally Stripes and a black vinyl top, this is a true head turner. Well organized under the hood is a rebuilt and numbers matching 290-horsepower DZ-suffix 302-cid V8 engine mated to a numbers matching M22 4-speed manual transmission."
