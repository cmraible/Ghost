<p>If you’re wondering how something made in the early 50s looks so fantastic, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-buys-a-rusty-barn-find-willys-jeep-cj-2a/">Willys</a> of course has been through a comprehensive restoration. That means everything has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and it shows.</p>

<p>That nice deep red looks absolutely gorgeous on the body panels, which are straight with consistent gaps. Dressing things up further is the virtually spotless brightwork on the bumpers, hood ornament, factory hubcaps, beltline trim, side steps, etc. White wall tires and a fresh cloth top with clear windows pulls everything together for a knockout presentation.</p>
<p>You can’t have such an amazing exterior and then be met by a mess of an interior. Thankfully the restoration not only cleaned up that area, it made it truly shine. Fresh black seat upholstery and carpeting pair excellently with the damage-free door cards and white factory steering wheel. Adding to the fun are correct controls and gauge cluster, giving you that fully-authentic experience.</p>

<p>This is by no means a muscle car or performance machine, but it’s a blast to drive. The 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine produces a lively 72-horsepower, while the 3-speed manual with overdrive adds to the fun. Driving this ride to a show or concours would be an unforgettable experience.</p>
