This Mopar muscle car dream car was the point of many memories for the couple until they sold it, but they actually got the change to buy the Charger back, something a lot of us who sell cars don’t ever get."

They also often took part in car events like the annual Dream Cruise on Woodward Avenue in Michigan. In 2012, they sold their 1969 Dodge Charger with the intention of buying a car with more to offer, but would realize they made a mistake."

They kept contact with the Charger’s new owner after selling it, and he reported that every time he took it to a car show, he was asked “Is that Marc’s car?”"
