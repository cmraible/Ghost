This virus, which all started from a nice, healthy bowl of bat soup, has sent people into a widespread panic which has made toilet paper rather hard to come by. Not only that, this pandemic has sent entire cities into lockdown, cancelled events far and wide, left a sports void, left countless people without employment, and has shut down our favorite restaurants and bars until further notice.
