Only eleven or twelve Eleanor Mustangs were created for filming, with seven reported to have survived the process. With the genuine cars coming up for sale very rarely, a handful of businesses will build you a replica of the famed pony car."

That guttural tone of its motor is rather exotic in the UK’s capital, especially considering the usual gauze of noise mainly consists of diesel buses and taxis. This Mustang appears to roam freely, a rarity in London, suggesting that the video was filmed early one morning."

Unique Performance will find an appropriate specification Mustang, restore it, and then convert it to Eleanor spec. The attention to detail is fantastic, with the interior and exterior looking every inch as spectacular as Nicolas Cage’s GT500."
