We'd like to see someone try it in real life.</h3>

<p>Recently, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/frua-bodied-camaro/">we posted a Camaro</a> that received <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/italian-american-1968-iso-grifo/">a coachbuilt Italian body</a> back in the 1970s. Is this what <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-age-yenko-camaro-wows/">a modern version</a> would look like?</p>
<p>These renderings are by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tuningcar_ps/?utm_source=ig_embed">@tuningcar_ps</a> on Instagram, who does several of them. They combined a pre-facelift Camaro SS with some styling features from the Lamborghini Huracan.</p>

<p>The result is an American muscle car with Italian flair that's integrated well enough to work. We wholeheartedly approve.</p>
<p>At first, it might not seem like a Chevrolet Camaro SS and a Lamborghini Huracan have anything in common when it comes to styling. However, both make use of a gently curving shape that's squared off with hard angles to make it look more muscular.</p>
<p>Of course, you can't just throw everything together haphazardly and expect it to work. That's what separates the good digital artists from the bad ones.</p>

<p>It's quite clear that the artist in question here took great care to ensure that the Lamborghini styling features were well-integrated into the Camaro's body and scaled appropriately.</p>
<p>In particular, we're most impressed with the way the headlights and side skirts work with the Camaro's overall shape. It's not easy to take the component parts of a mid-engine exotic and apply them to a muscle car. The artist did a great job here.</p>
<p>It's unlikely than anyone will ever try to make this flight of fantasy into a real-life custom. We can dream, though. In the meantime, we're looking forward to seeing what @tuningcar_ps comes up with next.</p>
