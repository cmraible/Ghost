<p>From the very beginning, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fast-furious-car-death-toll/">Dom’s Charger</a> captivated audiences. With its unmistakable stance and an enormous blower sticking out of the hood, it is arguably one of the most popular cars of the series and undeniably helped to build the franchise into what it is today. However, throughout its stint in film, the 1970 Dodge <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1972-chrysler-valiant-charger/">Charger</a> has been “destroyed,” rebuilt, and upgraded but it has pretty much always been there in one form or another. </p>
<p>There is apparently no exception for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/all-electric-dodge-charger/">upcoming F9 film</a> either as pictures have been released that show the car in the background of the film’s opening scenes. While we will all just have to wait and see what kind of role the Charger of previous films plays in the new movie, what we do know is that Dom does get a major Charger upgrade in the form of a $1-million custom build. </p>
<p>Veteran vehicle supervisor Dennis McCarthy returned to work on the saga for the new film and with help from the SpeedKore team developed the newest version of the Dom Charger. When asked, McCarthy said, “Coming up with a fresh version of a Dom Charger gets trickier with every new installment because there isn't much that we haven't already done." Even still, it seems like the crew really knocked it out of the park with this one. </p>
<p>With a Dodge Hellcat engine, a unique engine location, and a mix of old and new technology, this Charger is sure to top at least some enthusiast’s list of all time favorite <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/vin-diesel-favorite-fast-furious-car/">Fast and Furious</a></em> cars. Oh and just in case you missed the trailers, this Charger is not the only one to be seen in the film. In addition to this car and Dom’s old car, a 1970 Charger Tantrum and a 2020 Charger SRT Hellcat also make appearances as well.</p>
