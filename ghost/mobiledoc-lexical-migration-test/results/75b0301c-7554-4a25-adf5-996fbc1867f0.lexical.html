<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/teenager-scams-grocery-store/">teenager</a> who stole and crashed an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/audi-abandons-combustion-engines/">Audi</a>Q3 back on November 15, 2019 has finally had his day in court. He received quite the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-unloads-on-c8-corvette/">tongue lashing</a> from Recorder Elroy Clayton, who told the car thief he wasn’t an “outlaw” or at least he’s “not a very good one, as you’re here.” Despite his criminal activity, the man won’t be sent to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/feds-arrest-huge-luxury-car-theft-ring/">jail</a>.</p>

<p>Lemar Roberts-Lawrence of Romford, UK was only 18 at the time when he and some friends stole the Audi and a Ford Fiesta, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/louisiana-officer-muscle-joyride/">taking them on a joyride</a> before a short chase with police. He and his buddies were able to steal the keys to both vehicles from a key box in the front room of a house. How they had access to the house wasn’t revealed.</p>
<p>Since they swiped the cars in the middle of the night, the owners had no idea what happened. However, police in Dagenham zeroed in on the two vehicles as they began speeding, going 90 mph in a 30 mph zone. Police observed them blow through red lights and almost cause several accidents, including going the wrong way in a roundabout (what we call the right way).</p>
<p>Apparently, as the two cars were fleeing, Roberts-Lawrence behind the wheel of the Audi, one of the cars hit a vehicle being driven by an innocent bystander. Then the Q3 hit a traffic light pole in an island. That’s when Roberts-Lawrence hopped out before his buddies, in an attempt to evade the police. He was collared instead, then confessed to “aggravated vehicle taking.”</p>
<p>With COVID-19 a problem in the jails, authorities didn’t want to send the car thief there. Also, he had kept his nose clean for almost 2 years since the incident and has a 2-month-old child. However, Clayton still laid into him, asking, “Have you no shame that you keep bringing your mum to court each time? Are you not ashamed?”</p>
<p>We’re going to go out on a limb here and say he probably isn’t and that’s part of the problem. There’s little shame in stealing cars these days, which is at least in part why it’s become so common. Instead, we often hear excuses about why people commit such crimes. We’re hoping Roberts-Lawrence turns his life around, but he was given a 12-month prison sentence which was suspended for 2 years, plus he’s doing 200 hours of community work, just in case he hasn’t learned his lesson.</p>
