          "Anyone into Chevrolet performance, even just casually, has bumped into Lingenfelter Performance Engineering. It’s pretty much impossible to not since the Michigan-based tuner has been tweaking Chevrolet Corvettes, Camaros, and more for almost five decades. Now the company has a crazy plan to squeeze the mighty LT4 into GM’s midsize pickup truck."

          "This serious upgrade isn’t ready for the Chevy Colorado or GMC Canyon yet. When it is ready, the performance upswing is going to be huge. After all, the LT4 is a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 pumping out 650-horsepower. That’s a big difference from the optional 3.6-liter V6 you can get from the factory, an engine Lingenfelter has been offering a supercharger package for, boosting output to about 450-hp."

All three cars are known for their brutal acceleration and ability to smoke tires like mad, so you can just imagine what a Colorado with the same engine could do."

Since Lingenfelter was showing off an upgraded Colorado with the pulley package installed, we feel pretty comfortable in speculating this option will be made available to the public."

The factory-integrated BCM calibration is also included. In the video below, the Colorado is shown with its rear wheels on a dyno’s rollers, so at least this one example is two-wheel drive. It’s definitely possible a four-wheel-drive version of this upgrade won’t be offered, but we’ll have to wait and see on that."
