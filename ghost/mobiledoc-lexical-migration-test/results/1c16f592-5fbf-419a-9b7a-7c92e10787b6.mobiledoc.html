<hr>
<p>Car thieves in Westchester, Florida used a Mercedes-AMG GT 4-door to bust through the owner’s motorized driveway gate in a brazen getaway. The whole thing was caught on the owner’s surveillance camera and shared on a local newscast, which accompanies this article. Once again, we’re getting a potent example of how brazen car thieves have become as these type of incidents become increasingly common across the United States and elsewhere.</p>

<p>These crooks seem to have a thing for Mercedes, because they arrived in a GLA, which was quite likely stolen. After backing up to the gate, one thief jumped over the fence and was easily able to get inside the vehicle since the owner left the keys inside. We’ve seen quite a few cars with keyless entry/ignition stolen because the keys were kept in the cupholder overnight. This car owner told a local reporter he didn’t think anyone would be so bold as to try taking any of his vehicles while his family slept inside the house.</p>

<p>The collision between the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-door and the gate sent sparks flying and was so loud, the owner’s daughter thought lightning had struck the gate. Then another thief jumped into a Mercedes S-Class and drove off with that. By the time the owner ran out to see what the commotion was about, the 2 vehicles were gone.</p>
<p>At least in this situation both cars were soon located and recovered. The thieves disabled the factory GPS trackers, but the owner had an aftermarket tracker in each, so he was able to hunt them down with ease. Even though the guy did a dumb thing by leaving the keys in his vehicles overnight, you can learn from him by doubling up on GPS trackers.</p>
