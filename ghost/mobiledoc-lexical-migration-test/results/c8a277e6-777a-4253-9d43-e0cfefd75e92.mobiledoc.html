<p>A 2010 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-fieri-lambo/">Lamborghini Gallardo</a> Spyder driver fleeing from police in Astoria, Queens, New York <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminal-fleeing-wrecks-mustangs/">crashed</a>. The incident went down on February 26 just after 4 am when a police officer noticed the plate on the Italian exotic was partially obscured. Usually that’s an indication a vehicle is either <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wildest-stolen-car-stories/">stolen</a>or being used to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-muscle-catnip-to-criminals/">commit a crime</a>, but local reports don’t indicate if ether was the case since police were still investigating the situation.</p>

<p>When the police officer tried to get the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-lamborghini-countach/">Lambo</a> to pull over, the driver instead sent it and surprise, the cruiser <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">couldn’t keep up</a>. It sounds like the driver and his passenger realized running from the police in a large city where officers are everywhere and there’s no real room to run was a dumb idea, because they quickly ditched the Gallardo and hoofed it.</p>
<p>The plan seemed to work since the suspects got away. However, the driver obviously couldn’t handle the raw power of the Lambo since it spun out in an intersection, sustaining damage to the passenger door and the rear passenger-side wheel was torn clean off. We’re going to go out on a limb here and say this behavior indicates the vehicle doesn’t belong to either guy, but that’s just a wild guess.</p>
<p>Car thefts <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">have been on the rise</a> since 2020 thanks in part to the COVID-19 shutdowns and the economic turmoil which followed. While some thieves go for the low-hanging fruit by targeting drivers who leave their key fob in the vehicle cupholder overnight, others are targeting high-end rides like this Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder for a joyride, to commit other crimes, or to sell for some big bucks.</p>
<p>Local news included that no injuries were reported from the crash, like two fugitives would stop and supply that info before slinking away into the night.</p>
