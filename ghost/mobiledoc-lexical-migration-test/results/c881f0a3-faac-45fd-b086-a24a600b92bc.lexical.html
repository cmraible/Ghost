<p>Robert Downey Jr. might be best known for driving various Audis as Tony Stark, but <a href="https://speedkore.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Speedkore Performance Group</a> says that they've built him a <a href="https://speedkore.com/1970-ford-mustang?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious-boss-302/" rel="nofollow noopener">1970 Ford Mustang Boss</a> fit for a superhero. As if the '<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-ford-mustang-mach-1-restomod/" rel="nofollow noopener">70 Mustang</a> wasn't already cool enough, Speedkore went to work on this Boss complementing the classic lines with a modern look and stance.</p>

<p>Making this Boss look like a boss, the Mustang rides on custom HRE performance wheels that are tucked beautifully under the fenders. Those fenders, along with the hood, bumpers, front splitter and more, are created from carbon fiber, while the taillights, door handles and fuel cap are a custom billet. Even the Mustang logo in the front grille has a brushed finish with a carbon fiber background. Inside, the car is fitted with a European-inspired leather interior crafted by Gabe’s Custom Interiors, and it has the latest audio system with Bluetooth and iPod connectivity.</p>
<p>The hard work paid off as this Mustang has won several prestigious awards over the years including the 2017 SEMA Show Ford Design Awards: Best Heritage Vehicle and the 2019 Grand National Roadster Show where it took home first place in the Sport Touring class.</p>

<p>More than just a show car, though, this Boss Mustang is powered by a Ford Performance Aluminator 5.0-liter V-8 with a Stage 2 Ford Performance/Roush supercharger bolted on top. Detroit Speed supplied the Aluma-Frame front suspension, rack and pinion performance steering, Pro Touring coil-over shocks and QuadraLink rear suspension, and Baer 16-inch drilled and slotted brakes help bring this car to a quick stop.</p>
<p>No word as to how much was invested to create this 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 302, but it was certainly worth every penny!</p>
