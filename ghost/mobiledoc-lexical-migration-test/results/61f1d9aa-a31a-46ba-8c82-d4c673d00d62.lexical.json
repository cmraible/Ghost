I had much less time than usual to devote to the blog, due to a very successful working year, but I still managed a 15% increase on 2014’s traffic. I hope (and have plans) to significantly better that in 2016. Much of that gain was down to a handful of very successful posts, which you’ll find out more about below.\n\nI really hope to write much more – and do different forms of journalism – through 2016. While training and helping others to do journalism is gratifying (and lucrative), I have a real urge to write more myself. If I get to this time next year without doing so, I’ll be very disappointed indeed.\n\nOn the back end, I finally [migrated from an ageing Movable Type install](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/04/vale_movable_type.html) to a brand spanking new WordPress install on WP-Engine, considerably upping the server power behind it. Downtime has been minimal this year, which is gratifying.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, here’s the top 10 *OM&HB* posts in 2015:\n\n- - - - - -\n\n \n\n\n## 1. [Bookerly: Amazon’s new Kindle font](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/01/bookerly_amazons_new_kindle_font.html)\n\n![bookerly-eink](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/08/bookerly-eink.jpg?resize=960%2C730)\n\nThe top post of the year was *huge* in terms of traffic for me. And I’m very smug about that. For a while I’d been slightly concerned about the disconnect between teaching SEO for journalists – and the fact that I rarely work hard on SEO for this blog. I write it for the regular readers, not the “drive-bys”. When my Fire Tablet got an update adding a new font to the kindle app, and I couldn’t find anything good online about it, I saw the opportunity to write something heavily SEO optimised about it – and reaped the rewards. A couple of links from big sites when the font hit the e-ink readers added to the success. Nice to know that I can do it when I want to.\n\n\n## 2. [Want to read your iPad in the bath?](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2014/01/want_to_read_your_ipad_in_the_bath.html)\n\n2014’s SEO test is still doing the business. And I do, in fact, do this, on the rare occasions I have a bath.\n\n(I shower every day, before you go getting any ideas…)\n\n\n## 3. [Why your big custom CMS project is doomed](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/01/publishers-custom-content-management.html)\n\nA short, link-based post hitting number three? It’s the content. Too many people out there who have been badly burned by disastrous CMS projects.\n\n\n## 4. [Drink black coffee? You may be a psycho](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/10/drink-black-coffee-you-may-be-a-psycho.html)\n\n![Killer Coffee](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/10/killer-coffee.jpg?resize=960%2C640)\n\nAnother short post that did *great* traffic numbers for me. And I think we all know why, don’t we?\n\nMine’s a black Americano, thanks.\n\n\n## 5. [Amazon’s Bookerly font arrives on E Ink Kindles](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/08/amazons-bookerly-font-arrives-on-e-ink-kindles.html)\n\nThe follow-up to the year’s big winner couldn’t quite replicate its success – but then, there was much, much more competition for those search terms this time around. I’m still pretty pleased with this.\n\n\n## 6. [Markdown versus CommonMark: the ambiguity and clarity dilemma](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2014/09/markdown-commonmark-open-source-controversy.html)\n\nAnother 2014 post in the chart, doing the numbers thanks to search traffic. This was a big topic in a particular niche of the tech/publishing web, and there aren’t a lot of good explainers out there on the topic. I’d accidentally filled that niche, and saw the benefits with consistent traffic over 15 months.\n\n\n## 7. [Pando erects paywall of irrelevance](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/06/pando-erects-paywall-of-irrelevance.html)\n\nIt appears the appetite for posts mocking the self-important Pando team is nearly as large as [their appetite for stealing my photos](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/06/pando-copyright-abuse.html). I’m glad to have been of service in this instance.\n\n\n## 8. [Backed: Typed, a new blogging platform](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/02/typed-blog-platform-crowdfunding.html)\n\n![typed-blog-platform.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/02/typed-blog-platform.jpg.png?resize=960%2C454)\n\nThis one was a surprise. Typed was – *is* – a brand new blogging platform created by the good folks at realMac just down the coast from me in Brighton. Their crowdfunding campaign was a great success – and [the platform is now live](https://www.typed.com). It’s great that I was able to help promote that, and I really must hunker down and spend some time using it this year.\n\n\n## 9. [Chef Phil Howard talks about his drug addiction](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2009/09/chef_phil_howard_talks_about_his_drug_ad.html)\n\nThe first piece of *really* evergreen content on the list. This gets huge spikes of traffic every time Phil Howard is on TV. I’m not sure I can count on the traffic for much longer, though. The embedded video is Flash-based, and that will tend to decay usability and therefore search traffic over time. I’ll be really surprised if this is in the top 10 again next year.\n\n\n## 10. [Pando’s nicking my photos again](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/06/pando-copyright-abuse.html)\n\nSee what I mean about the appetite for posts mocking the self-righteous tech clique over at Pando? They nicked my photo *again*, and never apologised, even though they change the image when it was pointed out. And then they went and hid behind a paywall. Good riddance, I say…\n\n- - - - - -\n\n \n\nAnd that’s it for 2015’s traffic. I suppose I should get on with generating 2016’s traffic.\n\n\n"
