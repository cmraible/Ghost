<p>This is Lever Weekly, a recap of our work from the past week. If you only read one email from us all week, this should be it.</p>
<p>Below you will find a breakdown of our reporting, podcasts, videos, and live events — a feature now open to all subscribers. Following that, we are providing paid subscribers with an original column, written by a member of <em>The Lever</em>, connecting the dots on our coverage to deliver important takeaways.</p>
<p>In this week’s column, exclusively for paid subscribers, David Sirota and Aditi Ramaswami reflect upon <em>The Lever’s </em>ethos and the urgency of building independent media to disrupt corporate narratives, especially in the wake of this week’s seismic midterm elections.</p>

<h3 id="undistorted-election-discourse">Undistorted Election Discourse</h3>
<p>Buried in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2022/midterm-results/voter-analysis">Fox News’ national exit poll</a> from this past week’s midterm election, one stat sticks out: Less than one in five Americans now say they have a great deal or a lot of “trust and confidence… in the news media when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately, and fairly.” </p>
<p>You can see that distrust expressed in another part of the poll that explains much about why the <a href="https://popular.info/p/political-media-is-broken">media-predicted</a> red wave never materialized: As <em>The Lever</em> showed in our post-election analysis, a whopping <a href="__GHOST_URL__/eight-key-midterm-election-takeaways-the-progressive-electorate-has-spoken/">46 percent of voters</a> rejected the media-created argument that the Biden administration’s spending policies — not corporate profiteering — is to blame for the inflation crisis.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>Corporate media is completely broken right now. More and more political news is quite literally being <a href="__GHOST_URL__/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-spin/">“presented by”</a> corporate sponsors trying to influence politics. Put another way: More and more political news is designed to distort the discourse on corporate terms rather than hold corporations and politicians accountable.</p>
<p>The good news is that the aforementioned survey data prove that America has woken up to the mass deception. The even better news is that building alternative reader-supported independent media is now easier than it ever was in the pre-Internet age.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we’re building here at <em>The Lever</em>. And as you can see from this week’s clips above — and from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/email/05aeb676-ba13-4507-b201-0cf8d3883586/">all of our election-season reporting</a> — we’re making a big impact.</p>

<p>In truth, many in our newsroom went into election week feeling despondent. It didn't seem like there would be much to look forward to as results rolled in. We planned accordingly, writing our election postmortem — well, premortem — with a dim tone to match the anticipated dim results. But as election night wore on, we began reporting out early polling data and outcomes that afforded us a sense of cautious optimism during our election livestream event. The situation forced us to do something that, as journalists, we have plenty of experience with: be nimble.</p>
<p>So Wednesday morning, our editorial staff jumped in a shared Google doc and raced out an analysis unmatched by any that corporate media could deliver — one that told the story of a progressive electorate that showed up to the ballot box, inspired by the possibility of what our government, at every level, can deliver for America.</p>
<p>As importantly, we worked up a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/eight-key-midterm-election-takeaways-the-progressive-electorate-has-spoken/">midterm election report</a> that shows what can happen if and as more people awaken to the pervasive reality of a corporate hegemony. And it made us pause and ask the question: What is possible if more people read a publication like <em>The Lever</em>, which boldly tells the truth about power in our country?</p>
<p>This is ultimately our mission: to bring the truth-telling, investigative work we do to more mobile phones, kitchen tables, and coffee shops. And as paying subscribers, we owe you a debt of gratitude for allowing us to continue this kind of critical journalism.</p>
<p>With your support, our newsroom is not just complaining about corporate media — we’re actually building an alternative that holds power accountable.</p>
