That means you get the head-up display and data recorder, helping you to improve your driving skills by analyzing exactly what you’ve done during a run. Carbon fiber interior trim adds a decidedly modern, upscale feel. Also included are heated and ventilated seats, so you can get and stay comfortable easily no matter the outside temperature. A front parking camera helps prevent damage when parking, while the power-folding and auto-dimming side mirrors are another protective measure. Even more advanced is the rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot monitoring."
