The Tesla owner was way calmer than we would have been, given the situation. The renter is also surprisingly calm considering he’s been caught red-handed."

It appears to be matte gray, which you can order a Tesla in a similar color. Was something about the donor bumper damaged or defective? Is this like when mechanics swap good parts for defective ones on vehicles? That sure looks like a possibility, but we don’t exactly know."
