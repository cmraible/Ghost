<p>Police in Atlanta say a driver <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-race-arizona-deadly/">was shot</a> by someone in a silver Audi after rejecting an invitation to a street race. The whole thing went down over the April Fools weekend and has left plenty of people in shock. Sadly, it’s not the first time we’ve heard of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-driver-shot/">someone being shot for refusing to street race</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t know what car the victim was driving and police didn’t specify the model of the Audi. It’s a pet peeve of ours when something like this happens and nobody seems to think it’s important what cars were involved, but to us is means a lot.</p>
<p>Atlanta has quite the street racing and street takeover problem. The local media just calls it all “street racing” even though there’s a difference: one involves racing in a straight line and the other involves taking over an intersection or section of a street and ripping donuts and burnouts. Apparently that’s hard to understand.</p>

<p>Both activities are illegal and dangerous. Not only can participants hit innocent cars, pedestrians, and each other, violence is common at these gatherings. While it’s not common for them to challenge other drivers to races and then shoot them when the challenge is declined, like we said it’s not unheard of.</p>
<p>One of the Atlanta City Council members spoke with a local news station about frustration over these illegal activities that have become common on the city’s streets. It’s almost like something has been fueling this generally lawless attitude, maybe a movement that encouraged people to be defiant towards law enforcement as funding was cut back. But we’ve been told no such thing happened three years ago.</p>
<p>Now Atlanta, like a lot of big cities, has a real problem on its hands. People are getting hurt, residents are harassed and inconvenienced, and crime is on the rise. We just hope in the coming crackdown that’s inevitable enthusiasts who are just minding their own business and aren’t street racing aren’t targeted, but that’s entirely possible.</p>
