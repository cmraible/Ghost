As the story goes, Pininfarina hand built these prototypes but soon realized it didn't have the production capacity to keep up with Ferrari's demand, so Italian coachbuilder Carrozzeria Boano to produce the bodies. The 250 GT Berlinetta was powered by a 240-horsepower, 3.0-liter Columbo V12 topped with three Weber carburetors, and only a handful of the nine 1956 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta Protoitipos are believed to survive today."

This Ferrari was purchased new by a close friend of Enzo Ferrari, Guido Cantelli, who was a famous orchestra conductor. Sadly, he died in a plane crash just months after buying the car, and it was later sold back to Ferrari. The car eventually ended up in Switzerland where it was painted red around 1980, and about 10 years later, it was completely restored and returned to its original Metallic Grey hue. According to the listing, chassis no. 0435GT is currently in the process of being certified by Ferrari Classiche."
