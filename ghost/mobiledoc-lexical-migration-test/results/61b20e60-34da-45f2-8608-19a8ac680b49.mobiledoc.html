<p>Update: This stunning 2003 Saleen S7 sold for $467,500 on the Barrett-Jackson auction stage in Scottsdale on Saturday, January 18th.</p>
<p>The Saleen S7 first made its big debut at Laguna Seca Raceway at the Monterey Historic Races back in August of 2000. Mixed with racing expertise and a design ahead of its time, Steve Saleen created  a record-holding supercar-based track beast that started 235 times and took home 118 poles, 154 podiums, 78 wins, and 10 GT Championships. Included in that is a class victory at 24 Hours of Le Mans. Here we have a stunning yet potent <a href="https://www.barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/2003-SALEEN-S7-235969">2003 Saleen S7</a> that is scheduled to cross the <a href="https://www.barrett-jackson.com/">Barrett-Jackson</a> auction without reserve in Scottsdale on Saturday, January 18th.</p>

<p>Numbered 03-21, this is the 21st S7 built out of just 78 produced total with 15 of those being "R" models. Making this example even rare is the fact that it was equipped the Saleen Competition Package. The package included the powerful Saleen-specific 427cui V8 engine equipped with an uprated camshaft, upgraded intake manifold, exhaust, and ECU. With all these things combined, this S7 was given a healthy output of 550-horsepower. However, this package wasn't cheap at an additional $75,000 over a base S7 model.</p>

<p>After Scott Thomas bought the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/garage-queen-saleen-s7-has-done-only-240-miles-in-13-years/">Saleen S7</a> for his collection back in 2016, he sent it to Saleen's factory workshop where it was given a clutch replacement along with a complete flush of all fluids. Inside, larger custom seats were installed for better comfort and a set of 6-point harnesses. The sale of the car will come with the original seats and seatbelts if the owner wishes to put the car back to stock. Other highlights include a paint protective film, optional chrome wheels, upgraded factory touchscreen sound system (not operational), remote door openers, and comes complete with Steve Saleen's autograph. This S7 has a clean CARFAX history report, and it will come with all maintenance records.</p>
