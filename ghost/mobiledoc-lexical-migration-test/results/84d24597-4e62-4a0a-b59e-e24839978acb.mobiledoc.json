One you experience what it’s like to drive a 911 through a stretch of road or track with plenty of tight turns, you get why the following is so diehard. For those who don’t get it, the limited edition 911 Soundbar Final Edition might seem ridiculous. Don’t worry, we get why this exists and why Porsche will have no problem selling them at $4,250 each."

While some man caves do have such a wonderful feature, the next best thing is to have a soundbar featuring the actual exhaust from a 991 GT3 as the subwoofer."

Chromecast is built in for multi-room sound, plus it’s supposed to work with “numerous premium streaming services” like Spotify. We doubt any of this will clench the deal for anyone because this is a Porsche exhaust soundbar. Just buy it, you’ll like it, or don’t and you’ll kick yourself later."
