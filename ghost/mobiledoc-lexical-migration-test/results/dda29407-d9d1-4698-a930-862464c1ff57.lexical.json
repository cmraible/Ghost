This time it’s [Somesso](http://somesso.com/london10/) – The Social Business Summit 2010.\n\n<div></div><div>It’s a small affair, and one with far more people in suits that, say, Like Minds from a couple of weeks ago. </div>[![IMG_3142 - Version 2.jpg](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/assets_c/2010/03/IMG_3142 - Version 2-thumb-250x374-1609.jpg)](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2010/03/IMG_3142-Version-2.jpg)\n\n<div></div>What does business look like when everything is networked?\n\nJeff Dachis of the [Dachis group](http://www.dachisgroup.com \"Dachis Group\") kicked off with some interesting observation that he and he team came up with15 years ago when he founded [Razorfish](http://www.razorfish.com \"Razorfish\") in New York.: everything that could be digital would be, because it makes things better, faster and cheaper. \n\nAnd things have shifted that way, but there have been road bumps along the way. One major example was marketers co-opting the [dotcom boom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble \"Dot-com bubble\"), and creating a  whole lot of business that shouldn’t have existed at the time. \n\nMarketers took one way messages and tried to push them into an environment that was designed for more interactive and social communications – and he’s suggesting that the same is happening to social media..\n\nIndeed, marketers took something of a bashing in Jeff’s talk. “Social media marketing is largely ineffective and incremental at best,” he suggested. And it’s still not very significant – only 0.5% of digital marketing spend is social media.\n\nAnd thus, this is not a discussion about marketing, but social business – about using social tools to connect everybody in the chain that business involves. And, under [Reed’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law \"Reed's law\"), as the number of people in that network grows, so does the value of that network.\n\nAnd the purpose of today is to try and address some of those issues: \n\nHow do we take an industrial/assembly line model and move it to a sharing network?\n\nWhat is it about our culture that we don’t want to connect and share and communicate and how can we change that?\n\nBusy day ahead…\n\n<div> </div><div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top:10px;height:15px\">[![Reblog this post [with Zemanta]](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2010/03/reblog_c4.png?w=960)](http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/374a8d6e-f5d4-4018-8eba-81a151db7e70/ \"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\")<span class=\"zem-script pretty-attribution\"><script defer=\"defer\" src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"
