<p>Each week, we partner with<em> Breaking Points</em> to review some of <em>The Lever</em>’s most impactful efforts. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyNuEUKPtlo">this week’s discussion</a> with Krystal Ball, Andrew Perez discusses his recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/verizon-sends-in-the-union-busters/">reporting</a> with Matthew Cunningham-Cook on Verizon’s union-busting efforts in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Perez explains key details in the story, including the decision by the moderators of a private Verizon employee subreddit to ban any talk of unions, and discusses what actions President Joe Biden can take to prevent federal contractors like Verizon from leading aggressive anti-union campaigns.</p>
<p>Perez and Ball also chat about <em>The Lever </em>rebrand and expansion, and the importance of independent news media that exposes corporate corruption.</p>

<p>This collaboration adds to our partnerships with <em>Jacobin</em>, <em>Newsweek, The Guardian</em>, <em>The Hill</em>, <em>The American Prospect</em>, <em>The Intercept,</em> and <em>Earther.</em> All of these partnerships help defray the costs of doing our labor-intensive investigations, allow our work to have wider distribution and a bigger impact, and add to the movement to build an independent, non-corporate media.</p>
