          "Despite the fact that it is missing its 1500-cc engine, its green vinyl upholstered passenger seat, its front and rear bumpers, and some of its trim this barn find is expected to sell for between $50-$60k. A figure that does not seem far fetched considering current bidding is already up to $25k and rising. What do you think? Is a classic 356 covered in rust and missing some of its most vital parts worth such a hefty price tag? Considering that fully restored examples could be worth upwards of $100,000 or more I Guess that all depends on what comes next for the “bent-window” "
