It’s always nice when it becomes obvious the automaker was conservative in its stated horsepower and torque output figures. However, YouTube channel Freedom Street Garage has a video which seems to indicate output for the Hellcats isn’t what Dodge has said."

Another user claims the guys didn’t run the Hellcat in the right gear, hence the more anemic power at the rear wheels. Yet another points out that Dodge’s claim was 707-hp at the crank and that the measurement obtained in the video was much higher, so there was no fraud on the automaker’s part."
