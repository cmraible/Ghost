Despite coming from this body style's final model year (1972), this C10 wears the nose of the first model year (1967) defined by the single headlights and stacked grille, while the rear of the truck replaces the factory bed with a step-side cargo bed from a late-model Chevy truck. Elements such as the shaved bumpers, 20-inch wheels, side-outlet exhaust and the power hood and power tailgate make this one exciting custom truck."

What we do know is that a 400 cubic-inch small-black Chevy engine is underneath the hood of this custom truck, and this V8 is backed by a four-speed automatic transmission. Power brakes and power steering ensures that this custom Chevy will be a cool cruiser."
