<h4 id="stuff-i%E2%80%99m-reading"><strong>Stuff I’m reading:</strong></h4>
<p>• <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/defund-the-police"><strong>We Should Still Defund The Police</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>“It is clearly a craven gesture when multibillion-dollar corporations claim that ‘Black lives matter,’ even as they refuse their Black workers hazard pay, paid time off, or a living wage. Nevertheless, these élite searches for absolution from the sin of ‘systemic racism’ have reaffirmed that racism is not only about burning crosses and the N-word: it is also present in the housing market, in institutions of higher education, in the job market, and most certainly in policing and the criminal-justice system.”</em></p>

Having a friend in the White House would be a huge asset to Uber. And Harris’s record regarding ride hailing has shown her Janus-like ability to talk out of both sides of her conflicted temperament, appearing as either an overly cautious flip-flopper or a pragmatic politician, depending on one’s point of view.”</em></p>
