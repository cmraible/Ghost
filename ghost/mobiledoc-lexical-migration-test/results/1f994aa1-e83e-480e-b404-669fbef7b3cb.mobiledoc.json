Visibility is only 4 to 6 feet, so it’s difficult to see details in the murky depths. The diver is able to tell much of the vehicle is deteriorated, including the top missing after sleeping with the fishes for who knows how long. He concludes whatever environmental damage the car would do has already been done. Now the vehicle is part of the ecosystem."

Right away, you can see the tires are super skinny, which is a dead giveaway this is something built a long time ago. There are other hints this find is a classic car. The damage done by the water might be in part why it looked like a muscle car on sonar. The diver thinks it might be an old military vehicle of some sort. Maybe you could have figured out what it is even with low visibility, but keep in mind these divers aren’t necessarily gearheads, so cut them a little slack."
