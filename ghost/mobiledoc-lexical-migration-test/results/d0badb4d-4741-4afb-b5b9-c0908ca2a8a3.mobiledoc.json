At different intervals during the match, flying kites will appear, which players can target for bonus points.</p><p><strong>Dream Karate:</strong> Combining the lightning-fast action of Karate with free-for-all gameplay, players fight to light up the most blank spaces featured on the floor to expand their territory. Every space where an enemy falls by their hand will light up. The player or team that lights up the most spaces at the end of the round is the victor. It’s fun-filled chaos.</p><p><strong>Dream Racing:</strong> Players hop on a hoverboard and zoom through a downhill course filled with question-mark power-ups and challenging obstacles, performing sweet tricks to earn a speed boost and gain the lead. The first one to reach the bottom wins.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Features in Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10 Classic 2D Events:&nbsp;Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games can be experienced in a brand-new way with classic 2D versions of 10 events from the Olympic Games Tokyo 1964.</li><li>New 3D Events:&nbsp;Surfing, Skateboarding, Karate, and Sport Climbing add to the other 17 seminal 3D events already represented.
