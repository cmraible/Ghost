<p>There's no denying that the Ford Mustang has a longstanding relationship with NASCAR. However, the Mustang only only served official pace car duties for three of its model years: 1964, 1979, and 1994. For 1979, a special edition Indy Pace Car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/182418/1982-ford-mustang-gl">Ford Mustang</a> was produced, and it came as a surprise when this unique model became a hot commodity after selling over 10,000 examples. We stumbled across this <a href="https://www.ebay.com/i/123897331654?_trksid=p11010.c100776.m4872&_trkparms=aid%3D1110001%26algo%3DSPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20170316120926%26meid%3D95fc3b5522944189a75d650eed8063f7%26pid%3D100776%26rk%3D8%26rkt%3D23%26mehot%3Dpp%26b%3D1%26sd%3D184010346201%26itm%3D123897331654%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D11010&ul_noapp=true">eBay</a> listing for an incredible example of a '79 Ford Mustang Indy Pace Car with just 34,000 original miles.</p>

<p>Finished in a distinctive two-tone livery complete with Indianapolis Pace Car decals, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/182290/1986-ford-mustang-gt-hatchback-5-speed">vintage Mustang</a> appears to be in fantastic shape. Even better, the car is equipped with a moon roof to add some natural light into the cabin. Peak inside the car to a flawless interior complete with the standard Recaro racing seats. Every car was given an official "Pace Car" card displayed on the dashboard.</p>
<p>For the official pace cars on track, these cars were powered by modified 5.0-liter V8 engines complete with a Holley carburetor, aluminum high-rise intake, and 351 Windsor heads. But for the average driver, there were two options to choose from: a stock 5.0 V8 or a turbo 2.3-liter. Powering this special edition Fox-body Mustang is the turbo 4 backed by a four-speed manual transmission that puts out 131-horsepower and 142 ft/lb of torque. All of the pace cars were given an upgraded suspension with the addition of shock valves and front are rear sway bars.</p>
