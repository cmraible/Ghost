            "text": "Recently, a 2018 Chevrolet Camaro went head to head against a Ford Mustang GT in a drag race that truly surprised us. It's not because the Camaro won; obviously, that happened; instead, it was how well a 5.0-liter V8 engine did when pitted against Chevy's top-tier pony car. To put things into context, the ZL1 comes with a 6.2-liter V8 engine which produces around 650 horsepower from the factory. It's funny that this vehicle is considered the least powerful of the American performance lineup, considering it got a 0-60mph time of around 11-seconds. With this in mind, it's easy to see why a certain Mustang GT owner might try to challenge the bowtie-wearing pony car.",

This great sports car is a vehicle fit for nearly any track event though it clearly takes a back seat to its GT500 and GT350 brethren. In fact, if you look closely, you can see what messed this driver up when competing against the ZL1. Presumably, because of the drag slick tires, this car is not stock which is perfect considering its purpose. However, I'm not sure the drag slicks are necessary for this particular car as it already has trouble doing a solid burnout with said tires.",

            "text": "Either way, the first launch was pretty good, with the Ford nearly popping a wheelie, but after that, it had some severe hooking issues. Round one saw the Camaro winning with a quarter-mile time of just 11:17 seconds compared to the Mustang's 11:69, an excellent figure for both cars but an obvious win for the Camaro. The second round showed Chevy's consistency with an identical run, a rare feat, while the Mustang lagged behind at 11:74 seconds. You can guess how the final showdown went; the Camaro again showed the world and the crowd how to drive like a pro with 11:22 seconds on the clock compared to the Mustang's 11:94. So there was a clear winner. Still, as the comments section points out, the Mustang did a pretty good job of keeping up, and both drivers deserve a lot of respect for putting on a great show.",
