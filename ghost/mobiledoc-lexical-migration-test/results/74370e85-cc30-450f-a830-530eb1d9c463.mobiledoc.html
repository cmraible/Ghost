<hr>
<p>The 100th anniversary of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/carroll-shelby-describe-his-journey/">Carroll Shelby</a> entering this world, so the 2023 Goodwood Revival will honor the man and his legacy. It’s easy to understand why they’d be focusing on Shelby, a man who was a force to be reckoned with as a racer, car designer, and entrepreneur. His influence goes far beyond the cars which still bear his name, heavily influencing American racing and muscle cars to the present day.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the Carroll Shelby racing video Ford made back in the day <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-carroll-shelby-racing-video/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Since the annual event focuses on the history of motorsports, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">AC Cobra</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-adam-carolla-check-out-ken-miles-ford-gt40/">Ford GT40</a> will be getting plenty of the spotlight this year. Expect plenty of reminiscing about the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans podium sweep, an event glamorized not all that long ago in <em>Ford v Ferrari</em>. The GT40 went on to win the endurance competition four years in a row, rocking the motorsports world.</p>
<p>There’s a direct connection between Goodwood and Shelby. In 1959 as a driver he won the RAC Tourist Trophy at the track along with Stirling Moss and Jack Fairman. Back in 1964, a Shelby Daytona Coupe won at Goodwood for the World Sportscar Championship. Carroll Shelby developed the hardtops to compete against Ferrari, something many thought was next to impossible at the time.</p>
<p>For the 2023 Goodwood Revival, organizers will be displaying the MC-TC Shelby piloted in his first professional race back in 1952. We’re not sure what specific events or other displays might be planned to honor Shelby, but with the event planned for September 8-10 there’s still plenty of time for any announcements.</p>
<p>There are many other events <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/shelby-celebrates-carroll/">and such</a> planned for this year in the name of Carroll Shelby, proving that his impact on the auto industry will live on for quite some time.</p>
