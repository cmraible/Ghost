<p>This might be the mountaintop of <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1968-chevrolet-camaro-rs-ss/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">classic Camaros</a>. The original owner ordered this four-speed RS/SS with all of the goodies, including the gauge package, center console, and tilt steering wheel, and power steering.</p>

<p>The most striking part of this machine is the copper exterior paint. It's not a Camaro color, but it was special-ordered from the Corvette color palette. It certainly looks great on <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1968-chevrolet-camaro-rs-ss/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Camaro</a>, especially with the white striping and red line tires. </p>
<p>According to the ad, it's been repainted once in its lifetime, naturally in the original color. The ivory beige interior is, in our opinion, the best possible color to pair with the exterior. </p>

<p>Under the hood, you'll find the original, numbers-matching 350 cubic inch small block V8. Out back, you'll find a 3.55 Posi-Traction rear end that was recently rebuilt at a cost of over $5,000, according to the seller.</p>
<p>There's a lot of original parts on <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1968-chevrolet-camaro-rs-ss/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Camaro</a>, in fact. The floor pans and trunk are said to be original, as well as the dash, which remains crack-free over half a century later. This is a remarkably original car, and it has the trophies to show for it, too.</p>

<p>One deviation from stock is the hide-away headlights. The sometimes finicky vacuum-operated headlights were retrofitted with electric motors to aid in function and reliability. We doubt that even the crankiest stickler for authenticity would find fault with that choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1968-chevrolet-camaro-rs-ss/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This Camaro</a> is currently located in Puyallup, Washington. It's being offered for sale on the auction site The Driven Exchange. If you want to own one of the most incredible early Camaros around, act fast.</p>
