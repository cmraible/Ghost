          "The Avanti II was essentially a continuation car after production of the Studebaker Avanti ended in 1963, and from 1965 until 1983, this sporty looking coupe was powered by various Corvette engines. When production of the Avanti II started, these cars used the Corvette's 300-horsepower, 327 cubic-inch V8, and by 1977, the Corvette's 180-hp 350 cubic-inch engine was found under the hood. On top of the use of Corvette engines, the NCM press release also says that the Avanti II's fiberglass body was fabricated by the same company that has made the Corvette bodies since 1953."

He's owned three Corvettes in the past and he's got a C8 Corvette on order, but his appreciation for Avantis dates back to the car's Studebaker days. Hammer recalls falling in love with a Studebaker Avanti back in 1962, and he was finally able to purchase this gold 1977 Avanti II 55 years later after his wife passed away in 2017."
