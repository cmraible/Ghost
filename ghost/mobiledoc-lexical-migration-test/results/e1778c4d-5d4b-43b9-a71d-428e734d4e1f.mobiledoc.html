<p>The stunt may have cost a large chunk of change but for Travis Bell, it was priceless.</p>
<p>As kids, we were all impressionable with a sponge-like mind and  equipped with an imagination that knows no bounds. We have all dreamed  about one thing or another when we were children, something we would  hope to see in our lifetime. For Travis Bell, owner of Celebrity  Machines, his dream growing up was always to see the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/347031/is-this-the-most-significant-surviving-general-lee">General Lee</a> fly. But, what exactly what does it take to send a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/358418/1969-dodge-charger-general-lee-car">'69 Dodge Charger</a> through the air? While most probably think of sending a flying Mopar  through the air as no big feat, plenty of time, work, and money went  into making this is as legal and accurate as possible.</p>

<p>Bell followed all the necessary steps such as insurance, obtaining  the right permits, flying out 7 crew members, the mechanics who  originally built the car, and making the car appear as a real deal  General Lee, constructing a ramp, securing a location, among other  things. Just think, approaching an insurance company about sending a  classic Charger threw the air and getting a bite is almost slim to none.  However, the Lloyds of London agreed to do it, but it came with no  small price tag. With everything in place to jump a General Lee, it cost  $4.5 million. You read that right, $4,500,000 to jump one car.</p>
<p>As Bell grew older, he became even more obsessed with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/361623/restored-1969-dodge-charger-rt-hemi">General Lee</a>,  and he wanted to build one and become friends with not only the cast,  but the also the stunt men behind the wheel of the vintage Mopar. Bell  started the North American General Lee Fan Club Convention in 2001/2002,  which would eventually be renamed Dukes Fest later on, and his little  house Indianapolis became a destination for the Dukes of Hazzard. The  convention did attract stunt men and special effects guys, and Bell  would track them down and talk to them about the show.</p>
<p>Considered an action-comedy, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/393510/dukes-of-hazzard-collection-sells-60k">Dukes of Hazzard</a> series aired on CBS for 7 seasons starting in January 26th until on  February 8, 1985. In the later seasons, miniature models were used for  the jump scenes. Bell located the man in charge of making those  miniature models, knocked on his door in Redland, California, and talked  to him about the show. Bell's main goal was still to make the General  Lee fly.</p>
<p>While talking with the guys who made the real life-size General Lees  used in the show, Bell learned plenty of information and stories that  took place behind the scenes about the car. One mind-blowing fact that  he learned was that they destroyed 321 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImRvZGdlIiwiY2hhcmdlciJdfQ==">Dodge Chargers</a> to play just one General Lee through a span of 7 seasons. Because the  '68-'70 Chargers were actually unibody cars, even jumping one about 3  feet could be a fatal blow.</p>

<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/179366/1968-dodge-charger-general-lee">'68 Charger</a> was donated for Bell's attempt, and since the goal was to destroy the  car anyway, the amount of bondo on the car was not an issue. With the  help of a mechanic hired for the show, the car was slathered in bold  orange paint, decals, and a given a few <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/168574/1969-dodge-charger">'69 Charger</a> components to make it into a General Lee. The car was then sent to  another mechanic in North Carolina to be outfitted with a roll cage.</p>
<p>Because villains usually drive 4-door Malibus in these shows, Bell  and his team purchased one and also stuffed it with a roll cage. They  also went out and bought two more place cars to use as cop cars, and  they 'roll-caged' those as well.</p>

<p>The first five seasons of Dukes of Hazzard was filmed in Covington,  Georgia, so Bell paid a visit to there to speak with authorities to see  if he could use the location to jump the car since the original General  Lee made its first jump there on Saturday, November 11th, 1978 in front  of Oxford College. He was given the green light to jump the car at  Soldier Field if he acquired all necessary permits, as well as  insurance.</p>
<p>Since this was happening way before Facebook and the power of social  media, Bell was faxing press releases from his home when got a call from  Warner Brothers. Worried that they were going to crush the whole idea  and shut it down, he anxiously answered the call expecting the worst.  With $4.5 million tied up into the whole deal, one would be somewhat  uneasy if stepping on toes that big. The call was from Silverman, and he  asked about the event and then mentioned that they were planning to  make a movie based on the show.</p>
<p>The day of the big jump, it was raining heavily all morning. With a  life-changing chunk of change on the line, Bell had to make this happen  today. When he arrived at a somewhat flooded Soldier Field, there was a  long line of people waiting there to see the General Lee in action,  enough to hire some local law enforcement to make everything go as  smoothly as possible. With the jump scheduled at 2 p.m., the rain  finally broke around noon.</p>
<p>One of the stunt men on the show for Bo Duke, expressed interest in  barrell-rolling the Chikasaw police car that Bell and his team built  before the main jump Before long, a pipe ramp was built, and the vehicle  went rolling, eventually coming to a stop upright on all four tires.</p>

<p>General Lee was next up, and the ramps were put in place to make the  long jump. Backed up far for momentum with the patrol cars in place,  including a jump over Rosco's original patrol car, it was time to let  'er rip. The General Lee sped toward the ramp and as it did, the car  recoiled and the rear end comes over and sends the car into a straight  nosedive to the ground after launching 180 feet. After it hit the ground  head first, the muscle car was sent flipping end over end. The stunt  driver was unhurt, but the Charger took a severe beating. Jumping over  Rosco's police car was a success, and the jump itself was incredible  with plenty of spectators in attendance.</p>

<p>So, was it worth the $4.5 million dollars, the seemingly infinite  planning, and everything else involved in the whole process to jump the  General Lee? We can tell Bell has no regrets.</p>
