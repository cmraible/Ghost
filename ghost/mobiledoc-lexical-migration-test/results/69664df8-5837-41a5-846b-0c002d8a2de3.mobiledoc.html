<p>To a certain group of people, even car enthusiasts, the idea of taking a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-the-official-porsche-birthday-party-unfold/">Porsche</a> Cayenne on hardcore trails sounds like the dumbest idea ever. However, in the video included with this article, Bryson Richards tells of his experience building a Porsche Cayenne that’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-1943-willys-mb-jeep-travel-550-miles-off-road/">not only off-road ready</a> but is able to duke it out in some pretty rugged competitions. If that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-911-gt3-rs-riots-runs/">sounds ridiculous to you</a>, it’s time to open your mind and learn something new.</p>

<p>I remember how long ago saying something to a group of people about how the Porsche Cayenne Transsyberia was a fantasy <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/off-roading-your-bike/">off-road vehicle</a> of mine. The hate was immediate and harsh, because “everyone knows” only Jeeps are good at managing hardcore trails. In other parts of the world, it’s only Land Cruisers or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ranger-rover-damaged/">Land Rovers</a>, funny enough. It’s that narrow-minded viewpoint I’ve snickered at since, yet it’s far more widespread than you might believe.</p>

<p>It’s almost like these people haven’t heard of a Safari 911 before. Actually, I’m pretty sure they haven’t, yet they know “everything” about cars and off-roading. Funny enough, Richards has a similar knee-jerk reaction when someone brought up the idea to him at first, but the guy was smart enough to do some research.</p>

<p>However, this Cayenne was first built to be a support truck for the competition vehicles. That makes sense since it has more interior space for hauling parts and supplies. He knew he wasn’t building a rock crawler and wisely so, because that’s not what a Cayenne would excel at. But that doesn’t’ mean it can’t take on some reasonably technical trails, because as you’ll see in the video it can with relative ease.</p>

<p>Richards’ Cayenne has become somewhat of a legend in the off-road community. In fact, Richards says it’s won over some of the Jeep guys, which is a pretty amazing feat. Just remember, this is an off-roader of a different sort, so you can’t stack it up against a Wrangler with 37-inch tires.</p>
