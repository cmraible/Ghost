What it all comes down to is a desire to return to a time when BMWs were simpler, driver-focused machines which kept you intimately in touch with the road. You certainly can get that experience with this "

In fact, the current owner acquired it from the original owner a mere 3 years ago, which is usually a positive sign. Looking it over, this Bimmer looks good for its age. The seller states it was resprayed in Diamond Schwarz Metallic by the original owner, so that’s partly why. Being a California car, it hasn’t lived a hard life, another big plus."

The engine has been tested for compression in each cylinder and has a recently-replaced radiator and belts."

A newly-installed clutch and flywheel should help ensure the good times keep rolling smoothly. If you aren’t aware, this car is also rear-wheel-drive and it lacks the many electronic nannies you find in modern Bimmers, so you can really have a blast behind the wheel. Plus, you get the additional control of Bilstein dampers at all four corners."
