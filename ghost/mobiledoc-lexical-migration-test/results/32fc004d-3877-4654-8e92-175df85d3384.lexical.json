Most conscientious vehicle collectors already try to put as few miles on their vehicles as possible since it affects value and maintenance costs over time. The Brookings Institution report notes that the emissions reduction nationwide was “not substantial.” Cash For Clunkers only shifted the composition of half a percent of vehicles on public roads by replacing gas guzzlers with more efficient models. It also reduced gasoline consumption in the country by about 2 to 8 days’ worth of what was the current usage in 2009. In other words, it wasn’t even a decent half measure.",
