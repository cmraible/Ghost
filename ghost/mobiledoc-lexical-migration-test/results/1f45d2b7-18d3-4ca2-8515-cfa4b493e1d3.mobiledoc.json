          "Willie K. Vanderbilt was the racing enthusiast of the Vanderbilt family, and he commissioned Renault to build 10 racecars based off the French automaker's smaller Type 35/45 racecar. These 10 cars cost Vanderbilt $150,000 ($15,000 each), and they were all modified to unique specifications including having the engine and transmission mounted almost two feet further back in the frame. The success of these Renault racers was apparent right out of the gate when one of Vanderbilt's cars – possibly even this chassis number, according to Bonhams – won a 24-hour endurance race in Brighton Beach, New York."

Its history is well-documented after this discovery, and it ended up in the Indianapolis Speedway Hall of Fame Museum in 1957 when it was purchased by the speedway's owner for just $7,500! It stayed in the care of that museum for more than 60 years, and in recent years, it has won numerous prestigious awards including the Pre-War Racing class trophy at the 2016 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance."
