During this encounter, something happens and Joker, Skull and Mona end up in the metaverse before they’re assaulted by a large amount of shadows and try to escape. They end up being caught and brought before the monarch of what is known as a Jail which bears similarities to the Palaces of P5. While in here, they come across a girl in the Jail that comes from a box and helps them escape; turns out, she is an AI named Sophia and lives in Joker’s phone. "
