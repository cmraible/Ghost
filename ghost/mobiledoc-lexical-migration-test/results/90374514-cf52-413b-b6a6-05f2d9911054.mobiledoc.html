<p>Thank you for recently taking part in our “Protect Communities from Corporate Railroad Greed” action. We have exciting updates for you.</p>
<p>Initially, <em>The Lever</em> broke the news that Obama, Trump, and Biden officials helped lobbyists weaken rail safety rules before the Ohio derailment disaster. After consistent pressure from <em>The Lever</em> and engaged people like you, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg made a big announcement on national TV: He stopped pretending he’s powerless and promised to use his existing authority to improve railroad safety rules. And now, legislation has been announced in both the Senate and House to strengthen train regulations. In the press release for the House bill, the sponsors stated that <em>The Lever</em>’s reporting helped prompt them to take action.</p>
<p><strong>This is proof that pressure works — and holding the powerful accountable through pressure is </strong><em><strong>The Lever</strong></em><strong>’s entire mission.</strong> When you signed the action, you became a subscriber to <em>The Lever</em>’s free newsletter which will keep you informed about ways you can continue to help in these kinds of battles.</p>
<p>In this particular fight, <em>The Lever</em>’s investigative reporting shaped national coverage of the incident, and then with the support of people like you we forced Congress to start legislating.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, we broke stories about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/">how rail companies blocked safety rules</a> before the disaster, how the current administration is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-doj-backing-norfolk-southern-case-to-block-lawsuits/">helping Norfolk Southern potentially block future lawsuits</a>, how <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pretends-hes-powerless-to-reduce-derailment-risks/">Buttigieg was feigning powerlessness</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pressured-into-promising-to-do-his-job/">more</a>. The findings were then summarized in our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/opinion/ohio-train-derailment-safety-regulation.html"><em>New York Times</em> op-ed</a>.</p>
<p>We also expanded our work in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-how-the-lever-forced-buttigieg-to-do-his-job/">recent</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-how-to-derail-the-anti-safety-train-lobby-w-rep-chris-deluzio/">podcasts</a>, in widely shared <a href="__GHOST_URL__/watch-and-share-our-videos-on-the-derailment-disaster/">video</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/watch-now-how-the-lever-changed-the-response-to-east-palestine/">reports</a>, and during a recorded <a href="__GHOST_URL__/reminder-today-at-1pm-et-is-our-live-q-a-about-the-norfolk-southern-train-derailment/">live event</a>. All of that prompted people from across the country to speak out and force the Biden administration and congress to take action.</p>
