However, after finally seeing the car, he commissioned a condition report, which included the accusations that inauthentic parts were used to repair damage to the car, all of which was reportedly not disclosed."

Coys of Kensington reportedly entered “administration.” It’s similar to when companies in the United States enter bankruptcy, with Licensed Insolvency Practitioners managing the affairs of the organization. While it’s not entirely clear, this could put Pohl’s claim at risk. Just how long Coys of Kensington will be in this situation remains to be seen, as does whether or not it will survive."
