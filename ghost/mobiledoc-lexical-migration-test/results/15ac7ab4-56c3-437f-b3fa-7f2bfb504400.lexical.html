<hr>
<p>There’s no denying comedian <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-adam-carolla-check-out-ken-miles-ford-gt40/">Adam Carolla is hot property</a>, even more than when he was doing <em>The Man Show</em>. He’s branched out into hosting an incredibly popular podcast, plus he’s written several books. What you might not realize is like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/seinfeld-pumps-the/">so many other comedians</a>, Carolla is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/girls-spurred-jay-lenos-interest-in-cars/">huge gearhead</a>. Even when compared to other celebrities, his car collection shows true depth and knowledge of automotive and motorsport history, something you <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/kevin-harts-plymouth-cuda-now/">can’t just buy with piles of cash</a>. For that we truly respect the man and you likely will as well after you see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mr-bean-has-superc/">what all he parks in his garage</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out these celebrities' cool muscle cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Also, you should know Carolla <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-historic-trans-am-racers-get-flogged-at-sonoma/">races his vintage cars</a>, so he doesn’t just let them sit in the garage and gather dust.</p>

<p>With values that just keep climbing since only 140 were made, there’s little doubt the Lamborghini Miura is a solid investment vehicle. Many consider it to be the first true supercar and it helped really put Lamborghini on the map. However, Carolla insists he didn’t start collecting cars to get rich but instead just loves the beauty of vehicles like the Miura. Considering how much he makes off other ventures, we believe him.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini Miura SV</strong></p>

<p>Already an extremely rare car, this Miura SV is the only one to leave the factory with the blue paint and tan leather interior, making it technically a 1 of 1. Carolla took it to Pebble Beach a few years ago and turned quite a few heads.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini Islero</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/Adam-Carolla-car-collection-4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Adam-Carolla-car-collection-4.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Adam-Carolla-car-collection-4.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Adam-Carolla-car-collection-4.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/Adam-Carolla-car-collection-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>Carolla actually owned 2 of these Italian grand tourers with a big V12 up front, but back in 2016 was looking to sell them (and we assume he finally did). As the successor to the 400 GT and a contemporary of the Miura, the Islero was overshadowed and you have to wonder why Carolla was offloading both of his when he owns two Miuras.</p>
<p><strong>2005 Aston Martin DB9</strong></p>

<p>With a potent V12 under the hood, many consider this to be one of the best modern Aston Martins. For Carolla it’s even more special since it was customized by none other than Chip Foose. Like any proper British sports car it’s green and the interior is read, so it’s quite appropriate for the Christmas season. The man loves the combo, and that’s the important part.</p>
<p><strong>1979 Porsche 935</strong></p>

<p>As we said before, Carolla has a thing for Paul Newman racecars. One of the most notable he owns is a Porsche 935 he’s raced on a few tracks. Most famously, Carolla spun this car out at Laguna Seca during the annual Monterey Motorsports Reunion, but thankfully the man showed some poise and didn’t wreck out.</p>
<p><strong>1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass</strong></p>

<p>Paul Newman Trans Am racecar, it’s one of two Oldsmobiles the actor drove competitively. And yes, Carolla owns the other one as well.</p>

<p>One of many racecars Paul Newman piloted to victory during his time, there’s a lot of history in this Nissan 300ZX. Carolla has focused on collecting vehicles driven by the actor and avid racer, this being one of them. He also still competes in historic events using this car, demonstrating Carolla has real track skills.</p>

<p>Another of Newman’s racecars, this 300ZX is a sister to the 1988 model with almost exactly the same setup. The blue rollbar versus the white one in the ’88 is the quickest way for anyone to tell them apart.</p>

<p>Nope, this isn’t a Paul Newman car, but instead this racer was piloted by Jim “Fitzy” Fitzgerald, who was a racing companion of Newman’s. Like the other vintage racers Carolla owns, he’s taken this to track events and given it a good flogging, but it still looks beautiful so he wasn’t that harsh on it.</p>

<p>Another Paul Newman car, the actor apparently spent a lot of time behind the wheel and must have truly enjoyed it. That might have been because it was one of his first racecars, creating a sentimental bond for the man.</p>

<p>Developed in secret through a collaboration between Nissan’s headquarters in Japan and BRE in Los Angeles, this car was entered into the 1968 SCCA season and helped turn around the suffering Datsun motorsports program. The fact Carolla owns one shows he is a big Nissan/Datsun nut.</p>

<p>Lovingly called the Batmobile, this racer terrorized the competition on the European touring car racing circuit for almost a decade. Many Bimmer fans fantasize about owning one, even if it’s one of the homologation specials sold to consumers and not the track-only version like what Carolla has.</p>
