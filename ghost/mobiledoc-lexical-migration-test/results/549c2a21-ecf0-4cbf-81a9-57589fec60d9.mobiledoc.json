Looking out the window to see what was going on, he spotted someone else behind the steering wheel as the luxury SUV pulled away. That’s when Sanders decided he was going to ride or die on his scooter."

          "Ultimately, it wasn’t Sander pursuing on the scooter which led to the Lamborghini’s recovery. Andre Kalinine saw the teenage suspect park the Urus on the sidewalk near his home. Then the kid ran up to him and admitted not only to stealing the SUV but to not knowing how to drive. That’s when Kalinine talked the teen into turning himself in, telling him that the police would go easier on him that way."

We’ve seen a lot of criminals use a signal booster to spoof cars into thinking the keys are right there, as well as other tech-advanced heists. But in this case, it appears what happened was just old-fashioned criminal activity. In other words, keeping your stuff locked up is always a good idea."

Considering other residents have surveillance video of a teenager who looks the same burglarizing their homes, it appears this has been an ongoing problem. For now, the suspect is in the custody of the US Department of Children and Families and is in home confinement with his foster mother. A court hearing on June 18 will help determine his fate."
