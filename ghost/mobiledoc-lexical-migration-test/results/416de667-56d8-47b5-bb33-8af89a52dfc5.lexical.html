<p>It's been pretty quiet around here, hasn't it? Normally, I get to spend July gently winding down towards a holiday, and kick back through August. Not this year. I was working â€” late into the night â€” the day before we left for holiday at my brother's place in France. I've been lucky enough to have had a busy, but demanding, year so far with work. And it left me tired and burnt out by the summer. </p>
<p>That's one of the reasons why this blog has been so very quiet. I just had nothing left in the tank once I finished my paid work for clients. I'm making a few adjustments to my working life (aided by gaining an extra 6 hours a week by my youngest starting school next weekâ€¦ ðŸ˜¥), that should see <em>OM&HB</em> spring back into life â€” and hopefully stop me getting quite so burnt out again. </p>
<p>I had vague plans to work â€” and catch up on my blogging â€” while I was away, but the lack of WiFi in the villa (due in September apparentlyâ€¦) and mobile phone bandwidth at dial-up levels put pay to that. And that was all for the good. </p>

<p>I finally relaxed, enjoyed time with my family - and actually got some reading done. Admittedly, it was mainly genre fiction, but it was really nice to get back into the swing of it, and one of my post-holiday resolutions is to read more of the backlog of work-related books I have queued up. Feel free to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48300977?shelf=read">follow me on Goodreads</a> if you want to see those as they pass through. </p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy a few snaps from my time in ÃŽle de RÃ©. </p>
