The big warning shot in this war was Dieselgate, which brought Volkswagen to its knees and made it possible for the Germans to release affordable EVs like the ID Buzz, which is starting at over $100,000 (yay for justice). There have been other casualties in the ongoing war, but the latest is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles."

As part of its penalty, the company is shelling out $300 million, an amount which is more of an annoyance for one of the world’s largest automakers instead of a major setback."

Instead, it was a bunch of engineers and business managers trying to dodge (no pun intended) emissions requirements for over 100,000 diesel-powered Ram trucks and Jeeps sold in the United States."

Will that money be paid for fancy carbon scrubbing machines that do the work of trees? Will it be used to plant a bunch of trees? Will it be used to treat lung cancer patients? Don’t be silly, it’s already been spent on a pet government program you don’t have any say about."

Two more FCA employees are facing charges associated with this criminal conspiracy investigation. Good thing the Department of Justice is hot on this case instead of looking into the rising crime rates or other less important matters."
