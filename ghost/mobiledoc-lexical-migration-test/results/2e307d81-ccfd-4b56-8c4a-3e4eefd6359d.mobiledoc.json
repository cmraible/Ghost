Of the many cars at the event, some made with LS engines under the hood and others benefitting from a transplant, was this absolute gem of a classic Chevy.

For some time it featured a twin-turbo old school small block that served the car well. Unfortunately, a dropped valve ruined the engine a few months back. On the bright side though, the incident afforded Steinfeld a reason to LS swap the car which landed it at one of the largest LS-centered events in the world. "

As far as chassis goes, the Chevelle is all 1966 minus the Viking shocks. Among the Holley parts is the Holley Dominator EFI system which makes controlling the twin-turbo LS and 4L80E transmission as simple as possible. We cannot wait to see more of this car at future events or to see what else Steinfeld comes up with next."
