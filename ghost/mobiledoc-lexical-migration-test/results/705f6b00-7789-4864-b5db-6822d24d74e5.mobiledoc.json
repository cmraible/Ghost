In 1971, Mook was one of the young vehicle designers that Lee Iacocca had assembled to create the second-generation Ford Mustang, and his design was chosen as the initial inspiration for what would become the 1974 Mustang II."

In total, the Mustang II managed to sell over one million units during its five-year run."
