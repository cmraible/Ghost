<p>When humans wake up and find themselves lost in dungeons where they must fight their way through hordes of mutated enemies, a few questions spring to mind. In <em>Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder</em>, guide your humans victory by playing "the game", equipping them with weapons (or whatever can make for a weapon) and guide them through the labyrinth. There's a lot to be discovered here in <em>Despot's Game</em>, but it begs to question whether your minions will survive long enough to see it all.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p>RPG roguelites are a fascinating genre and <em>Despot's Game</em> executes this to near-perfection. With the theme of obtaining disposable humans to do battle at your bidding, progressing through dungeons feels very rewarding (and don't worry, the pangs of guilt from repeatedly sending humans to their doom don't last long). However, you can't forget about your humans' wellbeing entirely as the more you have at your disposal, the more food you need to have for them. Each human will consume one point of food when proceeding from one room to the next (even if you've already been to the room before) and if you run out, they'll fight with less enthusiasm and will probably die. Food costs tokens, so you can't just buy the best fighters and weapons willy-nilly, and it's this balance that provides a tonne of strategy to the game. However, you'll need to find that balance as spending too much on food results in less tokens for new units and upgrades, which can result in an embarrassing death with a mountain of food and no mouths to feed it to.</p>
<p><em>Despot's Game</em> is also so snappy, meaning that proceeding from one room to the next or starting a new run is almost instant. You're always in the thick of things, whether it's combat or strategising, and there's rarely a dull moment. All roguelites can learn a thing or two from <em>Despot's Game</em>, especially if you're a fan of the genre, because there's nothing worse than picking up a new roguelite and realising that the wait times between doing anything is unbearably slow.</p>
<p>Mutations allow you to add special abilities and stat boosts to your feeble little humans, providing you with a deeper level of customisation and strategy. You'll collect mutations throughout your journeys but you can also unlock more to find from the mutations menu; or rather, as the game puts it, "invest in a steady future!". This mechanic goes further than one would initially expect as after a few rounds, you'll begin to realise that with each unit's class, having a wide variety of units provides you with the depth and strategy needed to take down any enemy that comes your way. </p>
<p>The game's humour is wonderful, instantly poking fun of the video game medium by laughing at the "Chosen One" trope. Even your humans have names that can make you chuckle, which lead me to checking each one I came across. Sergei Hentai was an interesting one, and Scott Guts took me a few seconds to understand, but I felt a mix of laughter and personal shame when I finally did.</p>
<p><strong><u>SPOILER ALERT</u></strong>: At the end of a runthrough, when you defeat Despot, you'll enter King of the Hill where your human troops duke it out against other real players' army that they had won with. This is a fantastic show of strength an encourages you to continue playing again and again so as to rank higher and higher online. However, you'll only be included on the leaderboard so long as you beat a run on at least Normal difficulty, so be sure to keep that in mind before starting a run.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>RPG roguelite fun</li>
    <li>Quick and snappy</li>
    <li>Customisation in Mutations</li>
    <li>Wonderful humour</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Despot's Game</em> was built for PC first and foremost, and it shows. While Konfa Games certainly made an effort to account for this as much as possible with the ability to turn the cursor controls off, working off of buttons and shoulder bumpers don't lend themselves well to the game's initial vision. Funnily enough, I opted to use the cursor mode with the controller, which is something that I don't often do with games that allow for the choice between cursor and button controls. <em>Despot's Game </em>features plenty of menu options and intricate characters to select, so the preciseness of the cursor lended itself better to the gameplay, despite it feeling clunky.</p>
<p>As the game continued and I started to get the strategic hang of things, I found myself wanting to interact with the battles more so than just simply being a bystander. This was primarily the case in boss fights; units will simply attack the closest enemy to them, so I often ran into situations where every unit focused on the boss whilst all their lackies are wailing on my units with no one to stop them. This also seemed to be a similar issue with healers as they'll just heal whomever they choose to at that time; if I was able to direct their abilities towards key, high level units, they may have survived and I wouldn't have died in some crucial battles.</p>
<p>While the music is quite banging at first, with it being an upbeat dance track with a half notes on the snare, quarter notes on the kick and sixteenth notes on the hi-hat for the most part, hearing that over-and-over again gets old real quick.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>UI/UX doesn't translate well to console</li>
    <li>Bystander during battles</li>
    <li>Repetitive dance track</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-score-810">Final Score: 8/10</h2>
<p>A good roguelite feels natural in its progression, providing the player with progression even when it may not feel like it at times. <em>Despot's Game</em> pulls this off wonderfully and doesn't try to overcomplicate itself, which it could have easily done if handled incorrectly. The humour is subjective but I found it to be a hoot, making me smile in-between combat sequences. And while you may feel like an awkward bystander at times, especially if you enjoy your more action-oriented roguelites, <em>Despot's Game</em> does so much right that you can hardly fault it.</p>
