Now we know even people inside the industry can get a little loose with the term “classic car.” But when dealing with mainstream media outlets, they seem to have even less of a grasp of what could or should constitute “classic” in the market. With no model year listed for this Porsche, combined with the low sales price, we’re left wondering just what it could be."
