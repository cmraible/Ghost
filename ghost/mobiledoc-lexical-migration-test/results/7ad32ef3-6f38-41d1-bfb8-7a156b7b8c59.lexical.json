This all changed as we will discuss below:</p>\n<h2>The rise of specialist cloud hosting providers taking on big tech</h2>\n<p>Medium-sized cloud hosting providers such as DigitalOcean and Linode have been making inroads by impressing clients worldwide with their cloud hosting services – in many ways being formidable competitors to even Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. To proof that it is not merely a matter of anonymity but rather the unique set of features, including security and rapid CDN infrastructure, many known brands such as Slack, WeWork, Docker and GitLab have already onboarded with DigitalOcean. Linode, for example, opted to beat AWS on several points such as price, real customer care, zero vendor lock-in and way more simplicity, without competing with it’s own clients as is the case of AWS. Now, these two cloud hosting providers will scoop up another segment of the market: the thousands of service providers who seek greater anonymity.</p>\n<h2>Cryptocurrency paves the way for anonymity:</h2>\n<p>Paying for VPS hosting with cryptocurrency such as BTC, LTC, BCH, DASH, ETH and so forth carries a unique advantage. This is mainly because developers and IT companies who require anonymity tend to face their first hurdle when it comes to providing credit card details. The shopping carts of most hosting providers means that any claims of anonymity are practically invalidated. Cybersecurity firms, the adult industry and specialist consulting and security firms simply require an additional layer of real anonymity. The solution to all this? <strong><em>By using cryptocurrency – in the case of Bithost.io, the user provides only a valid email and bitcoin or cryptocurrency during checkout.</em></strong></p>\n<h2>How Bithost.io works:</h2>\n<p><strong><em>To try this for yourself, visit Bithost here: </em></strong><a href=\"https://bithost.io\"><strong><em>https://bithost.io</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>It is the first company to accept cryptocurrency for cloud hosting – it rolled out this option in 2014 already. This trend is now accelerating as the company accepts all available cryptocurrencies. The approach is rather simple: provide a valid email address and check out with your cryptocurrency details. The pricing is rather low and users should remember that the perceived price discrepancy between that of DigitalOcean and Linode VS Bithost.io, arises mainly due to the fact that Bithost.io needs to factor in currency exchange costs to convert crypto to USD.</p>\n<h2><strong><em> </em></strong>How much does it cost?</h2>\n<p>Currently as of April 2020, Bithost.io powers the cryptocurrency payments for three major cloud hosting providers. Pricing is scaled according to server usage. This is the pricing model without hidden extras:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Starting with resources such as a 1GB Memory with 25GB storage and 1CPU processor:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Digital Ocean: Hourly &#8211; $0.01, Monthly &#8211; $7.5</p>\n<p>Linode: Hourly &#8211; $0.01, Monthly &#8211; $7.5</p>\n<p>Hetzner: Hourly &#8211; $0.01, Monthly &#8211; $4.69</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Scaling up to a high level of resources such as a 160GB Memory with 1000GB storage and 40CPU processors:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Digital Ocean: Hourly &#8211; $2.53, Monthly &#8211; $1820</p>\n<p>Linode: Hourly &#8211; $6.94, Monthly &#8211; $5000 (* 20 CPU’s, 96GB memory with 2560GB storage)</p>\n<p>Hetzner: Hourly &#8211; $0.71, Monthly &#8211; $507.84 ( *32 CPU’s, 128GB memory with 600GB storage)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The verdict on cost?</h2>\n<p>Just how much should you be prepared to pay for anonymous cloud hosting? This will depend on many factors. One thing is certain: any serious business would not want to compromise on hosting features.  Considering a wide range of hosting reviews, with aspects such as cost, resources and unique selling points, the above prices from three independent providers seem rather competitive. It is fair to conclude that the added cost of having anonymous VPS or cloud hosting is in no way excessive, especially once currency conversions have been factored in.</p>\n<h2>The verdict on features?</h2>\n<p>With Bithost.io the user is not tied to one provider. Currently users can run an extensive hosting comparison between three top tier providers and make their pick. As explained: DigitalOcean already has several points of difference where it beats AWS and Microsoft Azure. Know exactly what points of parity and difference you require – and then compare these three providers (Digital Ocean, Linode and Hetzner) to see if there is a winner that suits your needs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Final scoop:</em></strong></p>\n<p>There are cases where offshore hosting completely bypasses DCMA legal requirements, yet this is not assumed in all cases. As with everything, there is also varying degrees of anonymity with cloud hosting. Let’s be realistic: in a world where anti-terror and bioterrorism are increasingly important, it is fair to assume that anonymity will stand up against the average consumer and sophisticated B2B client, but not necessarily against top government agencies.</p>\n"
