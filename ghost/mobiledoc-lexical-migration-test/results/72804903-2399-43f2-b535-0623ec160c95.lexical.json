            "text": "There isn’t much to focus on in terms of gameplay. The games are visual novels, so players will become fast friends with the A button. I’m sure the game is emulating the original experience in this regard but often the player will need to hit the same selection in a menu more than once to find out more information. Some examples: sometimes you need to hit option A thrice to get all the information. Sometimes you would need to hit option A, then option B, then option A. Sometimes you would need to hit option A, then option C in a different menu, then the original option A. My complaint with this is that the game does nothing to indicate that any option may yield more results. Options don’t gray out when they’ve been depleted of information, so there will be times when you’ve hit every option but the game isn’t progressing, making the only solution to finding out what to do is going through every menu, hitting every option until you hit the one that gives you something more. Sometimes, the order in which you need to hit the options is esoteric, making progressing somewhat infuriating. Normally, I would chalk this up to the fact that this game is 32 years old, but this is a remake. I won’t overlook the exclusion of basic quality of life features like graying out an option you don’t need anymore.",

Soon they find their close friend, Ayumi Tachibana, who informs the protagonist that he is a part of the Utsugi Detective Agency, a private investigator group, and that he was in the middle of a case. The protagonist then follows the steps he took and soon becomes reacquainted with the case he took for a client named Zenzou. Zenzou is a butler for the rich Ayashiro family and he had hired the protagonist to look into the mysterious death of Kiku Ayashiro, the matriarch of the family who had passed away the night she had gathered her extended family to read her will. Official reports state that she had died due to a pre-existing heart condition but Zenzou did not trust that answer and hired the protagonist to investigate. Rumors of a curse on the Ayashiro family are circulating throughout the small village and people claim that Kiku will rise from the grave and take revenge on the living. A panic arises when a second member of the Ayashiro family is murdered and what was once a suspicious passing becomes a murder investiagtion. ",
