<h2 id="where-substack-leads-facebook-follows">Where Substack leads, Facebook follows</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2021/04/six-thoughts-about-the-substack-local-initiative/">Substack's local journalism initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/apply-platform-independent-writers">Facebook arrives</a>, bearing a big old stack of cash. This looks like great news if you're into rebuilding local news in the US ‚Äî yes, this is a US-only initiative despite my distinctly British <em>League of Gentlemen</em> image above ‚Äî from the ground up:</p>
<blockquote>We‚Äôre committing $5 million to support local journalists interested in starting or continuing their work on our new platform for independent writers which you can learn more about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/supporting-independent-voices">here</a>.</blockquote>
<p>However, as a careful reading of the above quote will show, this is not a completely altruistic move (any more than Substack's is). Facebook <em>requires</em> you to use its tools as part of the deal. As always, I have questions about how portable Facebook-based subscriptions will be, and I'd always recommend that people take this money with their eyes firmly open to the degree to which it ties them a singular platform. </p><!--members-only-->
<p>As Emily Bell puts it:</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Substack started a local project, now FB moves in with $5m . Some local independent writers (those not in newsrooms) and their communities will hopefully benefit.

<p>That said, the local news ecosystem generally needs innovation and experimentation, and if this initiative helps facilitate that, well, good. And, as many YouTubers have proved down the years, you might start off with a revenue stream built around a single platform, but once you have an audience, you can diversify. </p>

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/Yes-Prime-Minister-BBC-640x360-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/Yes-Prime-Minister-BBC-640x360-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/Yes-Prime-Minister-BBC-640x360-1.jpg 640w"></figure>
<p>I was a massive fan of <em>Yes, Minister</em> and <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> back in my teenage years (which does explain a lot). One thing that has always stuck with me is the idea explored in one episode that, if you can't counter someone's ideas, attack the person instead: play the man, not the ball, as the TV show put it. </p>
<p>It's a useful filter to examine how people behave on social media through, such as this attack by Glenn Greenwald on James Ball:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a vivid mirror into these large corporate sites. James Ball never broke a story of any significance: let alone the Pulitzer-winning NSA reporting I did or the Brazil expos√©s (which his own paper heralded). Nobody reads him, so they use this framework to beg for prestige. <a href="https://t.co/NIxEolhQeW">pic.twitter.com/NIxEolhQeW</a></p>‚Äî Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1388829792640901125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2021</a>
    </blockquote>

<p>Clearly playing the man not the ball there. </p>
<p>James's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/02/substack-how-the-game-changer-turned-poacher">piece is worth a read</a> ‚Äî to me, it misses some key elements of the story, including the role of VC money in Substack's change in behaviour, but still captures some interesting ideas that I'm still mulling over. It's all about the attention, isn't it? It's <em>always</em> all about the attention. </p>
<p>But this sort of petty, vindictive behaviour being played out in public via Twitter is just embarrassing. Even my eldest daughter ‚Äî she's eight ‚Äî knows that this isn't an appropriate or polite way to act. It's no wonder that journalism has a trust problem if this is how some of our biggest names behave. </p>

<p>Does anyone remember the phrase ‚Äúnew media‚Äù? I do ‚Äî but then, I was a few years into my career when the first newspaper websites started appearing. </p>
<p>I recall being in a meeting in 1996 to talk about our publishers' internet strategy, when one of the senior people in the company came in, and railroaded the whole discussion because he'd just read somewhere that ‚Äúthe <em>intra</em>net is going to be more important than the internet!‚Äù. And so began a diversion that meant that the company in question missed the web boat. Most of its titles no longer exist. </p>
<p>That was <em>25 years ago </em>‚Äî just as the WSJ was launching its first website. </p>
