There’s TNT crates, barricades, lasers, and - of course - spikes. It wouldn’t be a 2D platformer without pesky spikes making ill-timed jumps a punishing affair. The sprites also have that squashed chibi feel to them which is awfully sweet. I have a soft spot for Chibi’s, and that means I won’t take any Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl slander. The more games that embrace this style, the merrier."

Through and through, it’s an extension of everything I love about the genre, all while not really adding that much to it. It’s what you’d expect, and what I expected was a great way to kill some time this weekend while I wind down from work. It succeeded in that; it did so in spades. It’s short and sweet, taking me about seven hours to wrap up, so if you don’t like snappy experiences, then there’s your fault. Otherwise, it’s a perfectly average platformer that does everything you’d want it to. Not every game needs to be a revolutionary 10/10. Sometimes, you just need something to slap on and lose yourself in a bout of escapism, especially when you’re having a rough time. "
