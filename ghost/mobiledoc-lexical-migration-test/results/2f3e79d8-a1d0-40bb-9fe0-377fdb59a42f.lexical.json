Cars like the third-generation Camaro have become nearly synonymous with the loud and fast antics of the southern hooligans we all know and love. However, one vehicle could be called the mullet of the car community for its design and performance. That particular car is everyone's favorite crossover, the Chevy El Camino, which, whether you love or hate it, is an American icon. One of the coolest things about these cars is that the front end is essentially a Chevelle, including the engine. However, the rear offers plenty of space for swiftly hauling loads of material. Here's a car that perfectly embodies that classic muscle truck spirit that made the El Camino such a legend. ",
