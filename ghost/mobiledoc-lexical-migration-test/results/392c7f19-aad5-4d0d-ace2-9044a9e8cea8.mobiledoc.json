Augmenting that are two aftermarket cylinder heads plus a Holley 4-barrel carburetor, so you’re getting plenty of air and fuel flowing into each cylinder for a potent burn. As you can clearly see, the air cleaner and valve covers are chrome, so you can pop the hood at a show and really wow the crowd. Functional four-wheel drive means this truck is ready to hit the trail. A Hurst shifter for the four-speed manual transmission makes this truck that much more entertaining."

          "Everything about the Power Wagon is bold, including the maroon and black two-tone paint on the exterior, plus bright yellow stripes for a loud exclamation point. Everything has been polished nicely, so any light that hits the body panels just glistens. Panel gaps all around the truck are even and alignment looks great from every direction. The OE grille keeps the exterior appearance authentic, while the side mirrors appear to be original as well.  Adding to the tough nature of this truck is a maroon bully bar that matches the rest of the exterior. It doesn’t stick out too much and it comes with tabs to mount lights for better nighttime visibility on a trail. A spray-in bedliner protects the sheet metal from scratches"

          "With an exterior that looks so good, you might be afraid the interior of this Dodge Power Wagon pales in comparison. Fortunately, the previous owner paid plenty of attention to each detail, including the black vinyl bench seat, which looks to be freshly redone and features a folding armrest. It’s obvious the black carpeting is new, so you’re not dealing with discoloration, grime, or wear in the material. All the stock gauges and controls are still sunk into the factory burlwood grain paneling, making for a retro masterpiece. A blank spot in the middle of the dash will accommodate a new sound system. There is factory AC that’s not working at the moment, but apparently it won’t be costly to get it blowing cold again."
