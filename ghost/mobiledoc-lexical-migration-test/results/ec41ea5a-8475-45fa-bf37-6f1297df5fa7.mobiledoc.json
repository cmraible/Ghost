Sadly, the person who contacted him with information said that he had sold the unique barbecue grille and was not able to contact the subsequent buyer. So Carroll is continuing his quest to locate his beloved Impala – even if it's just the front end."

          "Why is a barbecue pit made from the front end of a '65 Impala so special, you ask? In 1976, Carroll, then 17, made what he felt was a lowball offer of £100 (equivalent to about £724/$872 USD in 2020), and he was surprised when the owner of the '65 Impala agreed to the price. Like many of us, Carroll made fond memories in his first car, but in 1980, he made the decision to sell the car to pay for his wedding. At least he made a profit on the car with a sale price of £400 (about £1,726/$2000USD today)."
