The opening hours are a total pain in the neck, if I’m being honest. The controls are clumsy and the framerate is very inconsistent. Trying to walk anywhere feels like a chore and there is little to no direction, which means you’ll likely spend a lot of time wandering in circles and getting very confused about where to go or what to do. After the awkward stage is over, things get better, albeit only slightly. Eventually, you’ll get the hang of walking and that’s one less annoyance but even then, there are spots where the game itself just can’t function properly. If I had to venture a guess, the conversion from PC to consoles is likely the culprit of the clunkiness."

I’m usually pretty good at figuring things out and only use them as a last resort. This is one of those games where it would amaze me if anyone could complete it without one because the objectives are so weirdly specific and arguably pedantic; the lack of any real objective markers make this painful. I found myself googling and reading wikis every half hour in my approximate 10 hours of gameplay just trying to power through. You’ll likely encounter some frustrating roadblocks along the way, even with guides. Thankfully, once the quest starts to unfold, you can see how rich it is, despite its flaws.

The overworld is broken up into specific locales that can be accessed via airship and teleportation gates but each one is different and full of places to explore and character models to admire. As you can only talk to people when you actually have business with them, while practical, it’s odd in itself, so there aren’t any annoying repetitive NPCs to worry about at least. The character models you see in dialogues are painstakingly detailed and wonderfully animated. Every conversation was so immaculately done that even if I found the subject boring, I was enthralled by the graphics themselves. "

A better objectives menu and some markers would’ve gone a long way to making this game more digestible. As it stands, I have to conclude that while it might scratch that early-90s RPG itch, unless you’re a hardcore fan of the genre and are willing to overlook the glaring annoyances, you likely won’t enjoy it.
