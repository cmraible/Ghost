With a custom body and restomod powertain, this 1949 Dodge Power Wagon Crew Cab will go anywhere and look great in the process!"

Wrapping those bead-lock wheels, this truck rides on monster 40-inch tires, so retractable side steps make it easier to get in and out of this beast. Like any real restomod, this Power Wagon has a bespoke interior that is modernly stylish and luxurious with tan leather seats and carpeted floors to accent the wood steering wheel and vintage-style gauges."

Legacy Classic Trucks says that this 1949 Dodge Power Wagon drives just as good on the road as it does on the trail, and just in case it runs into any problems off-road, there's a winch built into the front bumper."
