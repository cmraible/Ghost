<p>Lately there has been a spate of think pieces bemoaning the rise of “left-wing illiberalism” and “new puritanism,” suggesting woke culture is ushering in a new era of mass repression. But as is pointed out in “The Methods of Moral Panic Journalism,” an article we highlight in this edition of Weekend Reader, progressives aren’t the ones responsible for the real authoritarian threat sweeping the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://michaelhobbes.substack.com/p/moral-panic-journalism"><strong>The Methods Of Moral Panic Journalism</strong></a> (Confirm My Choices) — <em>“Articles about the ‘illiberal left’ feel like dispatches from the Upside Down, a parallel universe where American political life looks nothing like it does in reality. Why are readers of national publications constantly being told that they should worry about the left potentially, sometime in the future, becoming </em>as bad as Republicans are now?<em>”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/the-we-cant-afford-it-bullsht"><strong>Week Ahead: The "We Can't Afford It" Bullsh*t</strong></a> (Robert Reich) — <em>“Biden’s plan may be the last chance we get to fix what’s broken in our system. But the public knows little or nothing about it — other than it will cost a bundle. Even if Biden and other Democrats are doing a poor job explaining it, the mainstream media is doing a horrendous job. A democracy requires informed citizens. How are Americans to be informed about something as crucial to their future as this, when they’re being systematically misled?”</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/23/joe-manchin-federal-investigations/"><strong>As Sen. Joe Manchin’s Star Rose In West Virginia, The FBI </strong>A<strong>nd IRS Probed His Closest Allies</strong></a> (The Intercept) — </strong>The Intercept <em>reports that when Joe Manchin was governor of West Virginia, his chief of staff was involved in a scheme to bail out a power plant that was buying coal from Manchin’s family coal brokerage, Enersystems: “In 2006, according to a source familiar with the rate change, [Larry] Puccio, then serving as Manchin’s chief of staff, was instructed by Manchin to meet with Mon Power lobbyists so that they would petition the public service commission to increase the Grant Town plant’s megawatt rate to $34.25, soliciting an additional $4.5 million dollars per year from ratepayers and bailing out the main buyer of Enersystems coal.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/17/disaster-survivors-fema-housing-trailer/"><strong>The Last Days Inside Trailer 83</strong></a> (The Washington Post) — <em>“When survivors are left with nowhere to go, the government sends FEMA to give them free housing, typically for up to 18 months after the date of the disaster. The agency has provided emergency trailers to nearly 200,000 families over the past 15 years. But now, with disasters and the needs that follow them increasing, the government finds itself trying to decide what it owes the displaced. How long is truly long enough to shelter the most vulnerable? Is it sufficient to give them housing or do they need social services, too? And should an emergency management agency really be playing landlord for years at a time in the first place?”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/21/morocco-pegasus-surveillance-journalists/"><strong>Morocco’s Surveillance Machine</strong></a> (The Intercept)  — <em>Regular </em>Daily Poster<em> contributor Cole Stangler worked with Rabat-based Abdellatif EL Hamamouchco on this investigation into Morocco's sweeping surveillance state: “Though the Moroccan state is often regarded as less repressive than many of its neighbors in the Middle East and North Africa, critics at home feel that it is in the midst of a dangerous authoritarian drift. The recent Pegasus spyware revelations have helped shine a light on just one part of that far-reaching and sophisticated surveillance machine.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.afar.com/magazine/westarctica-antarctica-a-micronation-with-a-mission"><strong>A Very Big Little Country</strong></a> (Afar) — <em>“On May 26, 2010, McHenry—who had left the military two years prior—seized control of Westarctica. A week later, on June 4, he celebrated his 30th birthday by declaring himself Grand Duke once again, making the announcement official from a suite at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa in Anaheim. Since then, much has changed. McHenry has hosted a rambling podcast about his life and become an ordained deacon in the Baptist church. He worked in the film industry. (After burning out in the film industry, he began working as a recruiter for psychics, all the while becoming more and more interested in the paranormal.) He raised $500,000 on Kickstarter for original tarot and oracle decks with meaning drawn from occult magic traditions. He wrote three books. He had two children, divorced his wife, and married a man. He has read Napoleon, Homer, and Plato, and can quote them all, but perhaps the words of Plato are most apt. ‘Everything changes and nothing remains still.’ Still, mea culpa to Plato, one thing has remained constant: Westarctica has been a country ascendant, even if it is for reasons altogether wholly unexpected.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/books/review/the-writing-of-the-gods-rosetta-stone-edward-dolnick.html"><strong>The 20-Year Contest To Crack The Code Of The Rosetta Stone</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“The nearly one-ton stela, experts determined, had come from a temple dedicated to the Greek-Egyptian King Ptolemy V in 196 B.C. And the three bands of text — classical Greek, hieroglyphs and an Egyptian shorthand called Demotic — were intended to proclaim the monarch’s achievements in multiple tongues to the peoples of the empire. All three were dead languages, but the Greek alphabet was still in use. The discovery of the slab, called the Rosetta Stone after the town in which it was found, reignited the ultimate linguistic challenge: deciphering the symbols of the Pharaohs.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gawker.com/politics/sinemas-drug-drug-money"><strong>Sinema's Drug: Drug Money</strong></a> (Gawker) — <em>“Those neon wigs don't buy themselves.”</em></p>
