          ", a political theory podcast hosted by three international Marxists. I love this show because of the hosts’ diverse perspectives (one is from the U.S., one is from Iraq, and one is from the Balkans), how much information they’re able to squeeze into an episode, and their extremely goofy style. My only criticism is that they’re three dudes, so the vibe can get a little “bro-y” at times. But other than that, it’s a great example of international socialism. This would be a great pod to share with a young person looking for some direction. "

As the description says, it shows how the attacks prompted “local surfers, politicians, and business owners into a proxy war with conservationists and ocean lovers worldwide.” The series also looks at “the government’s response to the attacks and climate issues that may have led to the increase of incidents” on the island.
