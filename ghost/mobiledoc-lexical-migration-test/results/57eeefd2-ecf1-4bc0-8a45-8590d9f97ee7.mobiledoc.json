The first model to be built under the direction of Jean Bugatti, it made use of some new and exciting features such as a dual overhead cam eight-cylinder engine with finger cam followers, four-speed transmission fixed to the engine crankcase, rubber engine mounts for a smoother ride, etc."

It competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, winning twice, catching the attention of driving enthusiasts. In many respects, its performance capabilities were well ahead of its time."

Vanden Plas, which was based in the UK, only bodied two Type 57S chassis. This is why estimates for how much collectors will pay for an opportunity to own a one-of-two classic Bugatti sports car are so high. The historical significance of this pre-war vehicle alone makes it a topic of intense interest."
