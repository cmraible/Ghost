The models in question include over 210,000 diesel engines. As one would imagine, this news sent the two companies’ stocks into a downward spiral since the investigation could expand along with the coming punishment."

          "It seems almost no automaker is free from the sin of engaging in emissions defeat device schemes, or at least being accused of it. At least here in the United States, the EPA is given incredible latitude to interpret what an emissions defeat device is, so what might have been okay within the regulatory scope in 2019 might today earn you a visit from EPA agents with guns. Too many automotive shops and parts manufacturers have learned this truth the hard way recently. It’s unclear if that’s the case in Germany or exactly what the violation Kia and Hyundai have been accused of covering up."

Not only has Volkswagen been caught up in scandal, so has Porsche, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Mazda, and Mitsubishi, to name a few. At this point the question should be which automakers haven’t been accused of cheating on emissions data."
