<hr>
<p>To say some people <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-crashes-house/">behave like complete idiots</a> behind the wheel of their car is an understatement. It’s the best explanation we can think of for a recent crash in Santa Clara, Utah which left a 1-of-3 1911 Auburn damaged. We’re never excited to see a rare, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dad-crashes-1966-corvette/">classic car crashed</a>, but it’s even more maddening when the accident was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1936-rolls-royce-phantom/">completely avoidable</a>.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hoodie-takes-blame-stolen-bmw/">local report</a>, it all went down on Highway 91 near the city cemetery. A newer Mazda3 driver pulled off onto the right shoulder to make a U-turn. The report doesn’t indicate if the driver activated their turn signal. Also, from the pictures it appears the road there has a double solid line dividing the opposing lanes of traffic, meaning the U-turn was potentially illegal.</p>

<p>Police say the driver of the Mazda saw that traffic coming the other way was clear. However, he failed to check that there was nobody coming up from behind. As a result, the Mazda driver rear-ended the 1911 Auburn.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a 1911 Kissel which was nearby wasn’t hit. Both of those cars are owned by the same man, Cam Sidwell, who was driving the Auburn at the time. He told a local reporter his Auburn has been shown at the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pebble-beach-wants-memories/">Concours d’Elegance at Pebble Beach</a> in the past.</p>
<p>Damage to the Auburn was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-accident/">severe</a>, said Sidwell. The wood body was cracked, making it necessary to do a complete teardown to repair the damage and repaint everything. Also damaged in the crash was a wheel handcrafted by the Amish.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Mazda driver complained of wrist pain. His front bumper and one headlight were damaged.</p>
<p>According to Sidwell, he and another driver had taken the two classic cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-model-t-off-roading/">out for a fun spin</a>, likely enjoying the nice weather. He said they were traveling at 30 mph or maybe a little under on a road they believed to be the least busy in the area, minimizing any risk. This just goes to show an accident can happen anywhere at any time.</p>
<p>Police say the Mazda driver was cited for failure to yield. We think he got off easy.</p>
