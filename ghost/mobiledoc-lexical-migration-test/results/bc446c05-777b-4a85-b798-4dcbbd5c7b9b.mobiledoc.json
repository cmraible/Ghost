Under the hood is the factory V8 engine, however, it is very unlikely that the truck will run without some work. The interior needs restoration as well, however, the seats seem to be intact and the gauges are all in good shape. It appears that the only thing that has sat in the front seat for the last 20 years was the spider that could be found upon opening the doors."

We hope to see it again soon."
