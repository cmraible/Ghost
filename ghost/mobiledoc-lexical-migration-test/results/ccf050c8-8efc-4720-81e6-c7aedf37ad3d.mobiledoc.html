<h2 id="some-useful-terms">Some useful terms</h2>
<p>This is a partial lexicon of some of the most useful terms in analytics:</p>
<h3 id="page-views-also-hits-or-clicks-">Page views (also hits or clicks)</h3>
<p>The number of times visitors view a page or pages on the site. This is all-encompassing. If a visitor returns to a page, or refreshes it, that’s an additional pageview.</p>
<h3 id="unique-pageviews">Unique Pageviews</h3>
<p>This variation on the above counts multiple impressions of the same page during a visit as a <em>single</em> pageview. For example, if I visit a site, and return to one page five times, but visits six other pages once, I generate 11 page views, but only 7 unique page views. This measures the number of individual pieces of content accessed, not how often it happens.</p>
<h3 id="visit">Visit</h3>
<p>An individual visit to the site, which ends after either a period of inactivity, or when the visitor departs the site. One visitor can be responsible for many visits over a period of time.</p>
<h3 id="unique-visitors">Unique Visitors</h3>
<p>The number of unique cookies that have visited your site over a period of time. This roughly equates to people - but not exactly. If a user visits using more than one device, each device might count as a unique visitor, depending on things like login status and the analytics package you use.</p>
<h3 id="landing-page">Landing Page</h3>
<p>The first page a user sees when they arrive on the site. Which piece of content they “land” on, if you like. Some sites specifically build out “landing pages” designed to generate traffic from search or social, but in analytics we’re referring to the actual first page of a visit, whatever that might be. Sometimes called an <strong>Entrance Page</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="exit-page">Exit Page</h3>
<p>The last page a visitor loads before they leave the site.</p>
<h3 id="bounce-rate">Bounce Rate</h3>
<p>The number of visits that ended after a single page impression, regardless of duration, expressed as a percentage. Effectively, the percentage of visits where the Landing Page and Exit Page were the same, and no other pages were loaded.</p>
<h3 id="visitor-loyalty">Visitor Loyalty</h3>
<p>How many pages an unique user consumes over a set period of time. Identifying your “loyal” readers - those who consume multiple pages over time - and separating them from “drive-bys” - one off visitors who consume a single page - gives you a sense of your regular audience. Connected with this are <strong>Frequency</strong> - how often people come back - and <strong>Recency</strong> - how recently they came back.</p>
<h3 id="new-vs-returning-visitors">New vs. Returning Visitors</h3>
<p>Another useful metric for determining the size of your regular audience, as well as seeing how successful you are at reaching potential new readers.</p>
<h3 id="time-on-site">Time on site</h3>
<p>Really handy for examining how engaged the readers are. Hits give no sense of how long a reader spends - time on site will give you a much better sense of how much they are actually consuming while on the site.</p>
<h2 id="traffic-acquisition">Traffic acquisition</h2>
<p>One useful and revealing set of metrics is <em>where</em> your readers come from. On most sites, visitors coming direct are in a minority. Understand the dynamic of how your content spreads can help you understand how to optimise it for that spread,</p>
<h3 id="direct">Direct</h3>
<p>As is sounds - people who come directly to your site, usually by typing the site address (URL) into the browser. Many analytics packages lump “Dark” traffic (see below) in here.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>People who have arrived via a search engine (usually Google in most of the world). In most cases they will be arriving on an article page rather than a home page.</p>
<h3 id="social">Social</h3>
<p>People who arrive via a link shared on social media. This will be broken down by social service, but in most cases, Facebook will be dominant.</p>
<h3 id="referral">Referral</h3>
<p>People following links from other sites, embedded in their web pages.</p>
<h3 id="dark-unknown">Dark/Unknown</h3>
<p>Traffic whose source cannot be easily determined by analytics software. Often the result of the use of apps, firewalls or some other system that “masks” the referring source. Has been on the increase, as apps become more prevalent and mobile gets more important. Often bundled in with direct.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>Often a catch-all term for other sources including (but not limited to) e-mail and RSS feeds.</p>
<h2 id="customer-journeys">Customer Journeys</h2>
<p>The next step on from monitoring these individual elements is to start tracking customer journeys across the site - understanding how people move from page to page. Google provides a useful guide to understanding this as part of <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course01/unit?unit=5&lesson=5">its Analytics Academy</a> (a generally useful resource).</p>
