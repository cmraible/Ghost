Here, you are tasked with protecting the village of Kamura from the impending threat of a large number of monsters trying to get to the village. These take the form of tower defence style gameplay with turrets that can be manned by players or villagers for an automatic defender or special instalments that only have a very limited number of uses. This game mode works much better with four people, so if you don’t have three other friends, you can always play with random players by opening a join request when you take the rampage quest or by joining someone else's. This is a fun addition to the series especially with the challenging Apex fights, which are monsters that are stronger variations of certain monsters.",

Wirebugs allow hunters to use special silk attacks that use one or two wirebugs to perform - some are really powerful attacks and each weapon has two default silk attacks. By completing quests or by forging eight of a particular weapon, you can unlock additional attacks that are swappable for standard attacks or a new silk attack. But these wirebugs aren’t done yet. Have you ever wanted to re-enact Godzilla vs King Kong? Well, with the wirebugs, you have the ability to mount the monsters and take control of them for a limited amount of time, allowing you to fight other monsters or just ram them into walls for additional damage. The wirebug adds a plethora of features that are really fun to explore and very satisfying to pull off.",

Graphically, the game runs at 30 FPS docked and undocked with only one specific instance of frame drops happening while docked with frames dropping to 26 frames at the lowest when actions are performed next to a waterfall. However even with three large monsters, four hunters and their buddies on the screen at once, I never noticed a single frame drop. It is genuinely jaw dropping at the miracles that the RE Engine has made happen on the Nintendo Switch.",

The Bunny Dango song is so cute and catchy; almost every time before a hunt, I would listen to the full song, unless I’ve only got a short time to do a hunt, like before going to sleep, which is usually followed by three more hunts and shame for a lack of self-control. However, this section is about the game's music, not my addiction to this game and all the tracks used are dynamic and captivating. As you make your way around in the field, everything is peaceful and quiet, giving a peaceful ambience – then the music kicks in as the hunt begins. ",

The unique themes are truly a piece of work that are so great to listen to, so much so that I’m listening to a playlist of them while writing this review.
