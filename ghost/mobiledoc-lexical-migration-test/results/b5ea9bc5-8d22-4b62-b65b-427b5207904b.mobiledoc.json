Instead of the 308's transverse-mounted, naturally aspirated engine, the 288 GTO features a longitudinally mounted 2.85-liter twin-turbo V8 rated at 400 horsepower, which is paired to a five-speed manual gearbox with a gated shifter. To make room for the engine, turbos and intercoolers, the 288 GTO is longer than the 308 and does not offer a rear cargo compartment."
