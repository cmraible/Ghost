That style gets even better with a roof rack, push bumper and a light bar with 15 (!) high-quality PIAA round lights that are sure help illuminate any trail any time. For maximum off-road capability, this Hummer rides on 38x13.50-inch tires with 20-inch wheels, and the factory central tire inflation system is still operational."
