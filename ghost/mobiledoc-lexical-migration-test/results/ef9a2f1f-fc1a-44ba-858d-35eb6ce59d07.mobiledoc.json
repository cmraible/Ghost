Sure, you could cynically say that’s why he’s not freaking out, but it might be the man has a better perspective on life. We love cool cars just like Schneider does, but in a time when people are suffering and many have died, a damaged vehicle – even one as cool as the General Lee – doesn’t rank nearly as high on the list of priorities. We’re sure the Charger will be fixed and those photos of its roof crushed by a tree will be added to the memorabilia in Schneider’s house."
