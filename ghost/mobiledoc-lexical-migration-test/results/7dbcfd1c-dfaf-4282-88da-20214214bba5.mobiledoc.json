And on the topic of technical issues, I encountered a few bugs and glitches that lead to strange and unexplained deaths; one in particular came from me leaving a room I just entered and finding the previous room to be nothing but a dark void that had me fall to my death; and then another room five minutes later had the camera refuse to follow me to the next room."
