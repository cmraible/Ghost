          "Back in the 1960s the Lincoln Continental was the kind of luxury car someone who had arrived would drive. Sure, it wasn’t as exciting as a muscle car, but as you’re about to learn in the film below it definitely appeals to 43 year-old men named Jeffrey who have a harem of younger women trailing behind. Rather than just lauding the Lincoln, this film compares it against the obviously superior 1970 Imperial."

At least we learn this from the film, which obviously only tells the truth and wasn’t made with any agenda in mind. Among the reasons why it’s that way is the lack of B-pillars, massive grille, loop bumpers."

The theft of batteries in 1970 was problematic, like how the theft of catalytic converters are today. For the ’70 Imperial the hood release is in the cabin, so you have the break the window or pick the lock first."
