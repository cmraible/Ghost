<p>Classic cars are a wonderful thing to own, but buying one that’s already been fully restored means you miss out on the fun. Taking something which once was glorious but now is in rough condition, then working hard to bring it back to a former state of glory gives you a sense of accomplishment. Since this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/165971/1957-cadillac-coupe-deville">1957 Cadillac Coupe DeVille</a> has been untouched after being left behind a gas station in Phoenix in 1973, the car needs some loving care. That means a tremendous project car for you.</p>

<p>Choose whether you want to fully restore this Caddie or do a restomod. Both are valid options and there are advantages to each, but in this situation you get to decide. You’ll notice the paint is in sad shape, but you can decide to either go with the rare factory color Amethyst Metallic or choose one to your liking. There is some body damage, notably a dent in the passenger door and heavily damaged rocker moldings, but with some work you can make everything straight and blemish-free again.</p>

<p>The interior doesn’t look much better than the exterior. All the seats need new upholstery, the door panels are damaged, the carpet is trashed, and the dash topper has serious sun damage. While it’s going to take some effort to bring this car back, there are some nice factory features that make all the hard work worth it. Among them is air conditioning and power windows, which are essential in the heat of the summer.</p>
<p>A factory 365ci V8 still sits under the hood, which Cadillac says makes 300-horsepower and 400 lb.-ft. of torque. Despite having 91,000-plus miles on the odometer, this Caddie still has enough oil in the sump and the oil is clean. The same is true about the transmission fluid. All eight spark plugs are in good condition. A fresh battery has been installed. The seller believes all the car needs to run is a starter and a good tune up. Marvel Mystery Oil has been injected into all eight cylinders, which will guard against metal-on-metal damage once this engine is turned over for the first time in decades. In addition, the tires are fresh, so you don’t need to worry about blowouts from dry rot or flat spots.</p>
<p>While Cadillac sold over 23,800 Coupe DeVilles for 1957, many haven’t survived and have been scrapped long ago. This one is rough, but it’s a potential clean slate for someone interested in doing the work. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Canyon+State+Classics">Canyon State Classics</a> is selling this project car, so if you want a chance to make it yours you should act before someone else scoops it.</p>
