The game is visually interesting in a unique way, despite being set on what should, by all accounts, be a fairly homogenous icy land. The graphics work just fine, and the stylized view of the world and characters helps one get into the mindset of visualising a story. Although it’s not photorealistic, it does not need to be and is stronger for it. Spirits, special platforms and mystical beings such as aurora people come to life in a mysterious, eye-catching way that is very well served by the graphical capacity of the game. On top of that, the game alternates in-engine scenes with cutscenes made of animated, highly-stylised artwork inspired by real Alaskan art and imagery, keeping the presentation fresh and interesting, always alternating the ways of telling its many stories.",

These cultural insights are unlocked as the player progresses through the game, and are always relevant to something happening in the gameplay itself. Upon encountering the northern lights, for example, the players unlock the cultural insight of the Iñupiat people regarding the aurora and are given context that both enhances the understanding of the next trial of the game and enriches their personal worldview. Players that appreciate storytelling and enjoy learning more and more not just about the game world but about other cultures within our own world will have more than enough to sink their teeth into. Never Alone doubles as a wonderful anthropological dip into a different culture and it is very much unique and incredibly well done.",

The game is made to be possible to play both in single player and co-op mode, and both characters are possible to be controlled, which adds to the annoyance as there are now two characters that can be gruesomely defeated by the menacing approach of a singular ledge.

It’s a fascinating look into a culture which holds fascinating stories and it was a true joy learning about all the aspects that were incorporated into the game, as well as the tales that real people from the northern parts of Alaska could tell. But that could all have been served as a book, or a movie - it’s simply lacking as a video game. 2D platformers are an excellent genre and it’s always a shame to see it not being utilised to its potential when it could have enhanced the game even further.",
