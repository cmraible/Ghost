<p>As the last significant American automaker in the United States apart from the Big Three back in the early 1960s, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/American%20Motors">American Motors</a> needed something to really capture consumers’ attention. Performance cars were heating up as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/american-muscle">American muscle car</a> wars began, and so history was made when the American Motors AMX was created. Now you have a chance to preserve that unique history by buying this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/184566/1968-american-motors-amx">1968 American Motors AMX</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">car</a> looks to be in good condition. It’s not going to be considered a concours example, thanks to small imperfections in the paint, glass, and other areas. But it’s definitely a looker with a deep shine in the red paint, white stripes down the middle, and a well-preserved black interior. It even has some nice factory details, like the original wheels and wood-grain accents on the dash. A lot of people will admire this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/AMC">AMC</a> and probably stare in silent amazement because they’re not exactly sure what it is.</p>
<p>Sitting under that hood of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/junkyard-amc-eagle-takes-on-jeep-park/">AMC</a> is the 390ci V8, which was the largest and most powerful engine offered for the 1968 model year. It’s mated to a 4-speed manual transmission, something which isn’t too common and definitely is desirable for enthusiasts. The dual exhaust and mufflers are new, so this car purrs like a kitten. The odometer on this American Motors AMX reads just a little over 32,000 miles, but you be the judge of whether or not that’s accurate for the age and condition of the car.</p>
<p>Essentially, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/AMC/AMX">AMC AMX</a> is a shortened version of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/AMC/Javelin">AMC Javelin</a>, which is more of a traditional muscle car. As you can see in the pictures, this car has only two seats  and a sporty look. It helped turn plenty of heads at a time when American Motors’ future looked shaky, so the historical importance of the AMX is pretty high. It’s definitely an unusual car, so if you’re looking for something you don’t see too often, this is a good option to consider for your collection.
