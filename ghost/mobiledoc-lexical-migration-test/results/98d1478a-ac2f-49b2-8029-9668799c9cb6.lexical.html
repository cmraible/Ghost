<p>The grand prize is this absolutely cherry <a href="http://bit.ly/35WwAKe" rel="noopener">1969 Pontiac GTO Judge</a>. It's verified by Pontiac Historic Services to be one of the first 50 cars produced for the '69 model year with the Judge package, which cost an extra $332 at the time. The package included the 400-cubic-inch Ram Air III engine producing 366 horsepower, Rally II wheels without the regular GTO's trim rings, a Hurst shifter with a unique T-shaped handle, wider tires, Judge decals, and a rear spoiler. This example is painted in the Judge's iconic Carousel Red exterior color with a Parchment interior, as well.</p>

<p>We have Ames Performance Engineering to thank for the quality of this Goat's restoration. Ames is the country's leading supplier of GTO restoration parts and contributed many to this prize vehicle. The engine, for example, is rebuilt to factory specs but is not the original motor. The original block, though, will be included with the vehicle.</p>
