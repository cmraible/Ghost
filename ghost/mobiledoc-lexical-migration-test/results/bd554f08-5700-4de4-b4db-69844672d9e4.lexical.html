<p>Welcome to TechieBytes episode 81 titled <em>It's time to destigmatize cannabis usage (feat. Amanda Goetz)</em></p>
<p>Today I'm speaking with <a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz">Amanda Goetz</a>, the founder & CEO at <a href="https://houseofwise.co/?ref=literallyev ">House of Wise</a>, a luxury CBD brand geared towards women. We discuss how trying cannabis for the first time in our 30s changed our lives, the challenges being faced by cannabis companies, what it means to be a Wise Woman, and her upcoming move to Miami! Enjoy!</p>
