That’s evident with the broad and well-padded mustang seat, plus the fact there are rider and passenger floorboards (they’re adjustable for the passenger). The passenger also gets a backrest. A heel-toe shifter makes life simpler for the rider. Located on both sides, the saddlebags are lockable, so you can stow what you need without worry. A luggage rack in the rear allows you to carry more gear, like sleeping bags or a small tent, making this a more practical weekend getaway vehicle."

The kickstand is also slightly bent. This Yamaha has definitely been ridden, as the 47,851 miles on the odometer attest, so it comes at a lower price than some might be expecting."
