<p>With sleek and elegant body lines, there's not much that is more aesthetically pleasing than the distinct lines of a Porsche. This stunning <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1997-porsche-911-carrera-4s-20/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1997 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S</a> was sold brand new in Illinois before residing in Ohio and Oregon. As of three years ago, this Porsche has become the dealer's personal car, and now it is looking for a new home through <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Bring A Trailer</a>.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/1997-porsche-911-carrera-4s-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" 1997-porsche-911-carrera-4s.jpg" alt="The front of a 1997 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S in Arena Red Metallic">" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>The curvaceous body lines are slathered in the beautiful shade of Arena Red Metallic. A set of TechArt fog lights are housed on the front, and it also has a protective film on the forward surfaces and rear quarters to protect it from any flying road debris. A set of refinished metallic gray 18-inch Technology hollow spoke turbo twist alloy wheels sit on all four corners and are wrapped with Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires (225/40 front, 285/30 back) which were added just 400 miles ago. Behind the wheels are aluminum brake calipers finished in red mated to cross-drilled and ventilated discs along with new brake pads all around.</p>
<p>Under the hood sits a 3.6-liter M64 flat-six engine that is air cooled and capable of 282-horsepower and 250 lb/ft of torque, and power is shifted by a rebuilt 6-speed manual transaxle. The engine received rebuilt cylinder heads with enlarged SAI ports, re-sealed heads, and new case bolts, and a new clutch was installed at this same time. More mechanical highlights include a short-ratio gear set, motorsport steel synchros, 993 RS flywheel, Goldenrod short shifter, Fister Stage III muffler, RoW sway bars, lowered ride height, a Ruf steering wheel, Goldenrod short shift, and a classic Porsche stereo complete with navigation. Stabilization comes from a carbon fiber front strut tower bar that was added before the current owner.</p>

<p>Open the doors to a Classic gray leather interior equipped with factory sports seats with matching carpeting and interior panels. A set of black Porsche scripted floor mats are also found inside along with the Ruf airbag steering wheel, Porsche Classic stereo receiver complete with navigation, and aluminum pedal pads. Even more, a fire extinguisher with billet mounts can be found inside, and let the sun in with a sunroof with new seals. In the dash sits factory VDO instrumentation including a 7,000-rpm tachometer, 180-mph speedometer, analog clock, and four auxiliary gauges. The car reads at 86,000 miles, and the current seller added about 5,000 to the clock.</p>
