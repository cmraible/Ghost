The Power Wagon was the first four-wheel drive vehicle to be offered to the American public in 1946 and was based on the military spec 3/4-ton truck. Originally Dodge used a model number of WDX and then later in 1957 it became the WM-300, the term Power Wagon was actually a generic term for a civilian four-wheel drive vehicle. These vehicles were popular after World War II as America went back to work."
