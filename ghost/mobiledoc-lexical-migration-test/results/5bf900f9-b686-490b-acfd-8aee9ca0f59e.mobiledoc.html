<p><a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/15579/1962-Chevrolet-Shriner-Corvette">The Chevy Corvette</a> is an American sports car legend. You’ll be hard pressed to find a fan of American performance cars that isn’t a fan of the Chevy Corvette. This is a car that broke down barriers and challenged automakers from all over the world. In the Early 1960s, <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/15923/1961-Chevrolet-Corvette-Convertible">the Chevy Corvette</a> was still in its first run, and about to undergo quite the change. Many car collectors like to purchase cars from the first generation of the Corvette, since that’s the generation which started it all. At the MAG Auction coming up this weekend, you can get your hands on a first generation Chevy Corvette, if you’re ready to bid!</p>
