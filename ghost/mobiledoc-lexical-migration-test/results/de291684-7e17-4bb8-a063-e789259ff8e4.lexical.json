However, many don't know that the production of these cars was not merely limited to the 1960s era of racing. In fact, the Ford GT was still being produced as recently as 2022 which many fans of the brand are quite proud of despite the off-putting V6 powertrain. This particular model was made in a time when big V8 engines still ruled the streets and judging by its looks you might not even realize it's only about 18 years old.",

Ford originally built the first car to beat Ferrari at the 24 hours of Le Mans. You clearly see this in the design of this vehicle’s generation despite having been made multiple decades after the original racer.",

This would have added up to four valves per cylinder allowing for maximum airflow through the engine. In total this would eventually help the car produce around 550 horsepower in the officially produced models. Of course, this vehicle was a prototype widely used for testing by the engineering team who pushed the car to its limits. One such limit was a top speed of 200 miles per hour which was reportedly accomplished by the car. If that sounds amazing to you then you should certainly consider this incredible Ford for your next automotive purchase.",
