<p>On <em>The Daily Poster</em>’<em>s</em> newest podcast, Sirota and Tom Frank discuss Frank's controversial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/wuhan-coronavirus-lab-leak-covid-virus-origins-china"><em>Guardian</em> op-ed</a> about the power of elite groupthink and the pushback against scientifically reviewing the theory that the coronavirus leaked from an American-funded lab in China. </p>
<p>The discussion first begins with a review of some <em>Daily Poster</em> reporting this week on the housing market, and then moves into a deep-dive discussion of the lab-leak theory.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>Though that theory has not been substantiated, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-lab-leak-theory-inside-the-fight-to-uncover-covid-19s-origins">new reporting</a> has raised legitimate questions about so-called “gain of function” research related to viruses — and the Biden administration has now <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/923e0256-7f7e-43ef-b4fe-64c066b8b70b">launched</a> an inquiry. Frank’s column argues that if the lab-leak theory is proven true — or even partly true — it will be a huge blow against the entire notion of expertise, after a year in which political and media elites insisted that the hypothesis wasn’t even worthy of legitimate discussion.</p>
<p>To be sure, bad-faith right-wing actors have been trying to manipulate the story about the COVID-19 pandemic to gin up hostility against China — and if the Wuhan lab-leak theory has any merit, they will use that to try to fuel their dangerous political agenda. But here’s the key question: Should politically inconvenient facts and scientific inquiry be avoided just because bad-faith voices will inevitably try to distort them?</p>
