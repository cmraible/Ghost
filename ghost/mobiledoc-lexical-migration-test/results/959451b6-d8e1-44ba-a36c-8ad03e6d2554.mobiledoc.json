With production capped at just 3,300 units and people super excited to own the 840-horsepower purpose-built factory car, even at inflated prices the Demons were snatched up in a hurry. Except this one has sat all this time and we can’t help but feel it has something to do with the price."

Whatever the story is, the dealer believes writing the vehicle description in all caps and ending every sentence with two exclamation points will get you super excited."

Another has 105 miles on the odometer with an asking price of $179,995. Finally, there’s an example with just 47 miles on the clock and it can be yours for $189,950. So why would anyone pay $500,000 (okay, $499,999) for 44 fewer miles? If you have some insight into how that’s a screaming deal, please let us know, we’re dying to know."
