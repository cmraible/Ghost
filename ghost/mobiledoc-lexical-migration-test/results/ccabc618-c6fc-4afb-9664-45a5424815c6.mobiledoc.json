The crash took place on County Road 484 in Belleview, Florida around 3 pm on March 24. After Marion County Fire Rescue arrived, it took about five minutes to extricate the driver from the Corvette. However, he was pronounced dead at the scene."

With the front bumper probably about head-level with the driver of the Chevy, the wreck proved fatal. Both the sports car and truck slid onto the southeast portion of the grassy road shoulder. As you can see from the photos, pieces of both vehicles were scattered a good distance."

After coming to a stop at a traffic light, the Chevy was first in the left lane and so the driver punched it, surging ahead of the rest of the cars. Then it transitioned into the right lane near Southeast 25th Avenue, where the crash took place. The man claimed when the Corvette was hit, the collision was so violent the sports car went airborne before landing on its wheels again."
