Immediately, I was hit with a barrage of accusations, because apparently I was spreading conspiracy theories and false news, plus I’m supposedly an idiot and all sorts of vile insults I can’t publish. Anyway, that crazy “conspiracy theory” of $10 a gallon for gas is here, only it hit California first, just as I predicted on our podcast."

With the way gas prices keep climbing daily, it will arrive at $10 very soon, maybe even by the time you read this. And if you think the rest of California as well as other states aren’t that far behind, you haven’t been watching the market all that closely in the last few months."

I’d much rather have been wrong. Never before have I seen something like this. Anyone saying this is like 2008 all over isn’t paying attention, because we blew past all those comparisons a while ago. Maybe there will be some similarities with the shortages in the 1970s, but I think this could eclipse even that."
