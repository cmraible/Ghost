Similar to a passport for an individual, all cars and other goods which enter the UK must have these to ensure they don’t simply vanish. Remember, the government must track all you do. And there’s a high cost for this government oversight, to the tune of 40% of the car’s value. That means importing a £100,000 vehicle requires the owner to put down £40,000 up front. Plus, there’s more paperwork to manage with this process."
