Well, I was just enjoying not commuting the normal London route for once, and enjoying seeing the view from the A12 in daylight. I seem to see it at night most of the time, and it really does pass through an attractive part of the world, despite its flatness. (I’m a hills-and-trees guy at heart)\n\nAnyway, there you have it: today’s one-off alternative commute.\n\n\n"
