Matching the performance of that engine is a Muncie 4-speed transmission, Hurst shifter, plus a 12-bolt rear. You also get a performance suspension, quick-ratio steering, and performance brakes, meaning this ride is ready to show off on the track just as much as cruising down Main Street."

It was made as a result of GM’s participation in the famous Trans Am race series, so you get a real track-worthy car for the street. For quite a few people, when they picture a classic American muscle car in their head, this is the vehicle that comes to mind. That kind of street credibility means this particular Camaro is a solid investment and valuable addition to your car collection."
