          "Looking as pristine as it did back in 1968, this Camaro RS/SS benefits from a full restoration finished in a striking Matador Red paint job with a black soft top. Thanks to the RS appearance package, the exterior is complemented by the hood stripe, hidden headlights and factory rallye wheels, while the SS package adds the fake chrome vents on the hood. Inside this Camaro, it's clear that no detail was overlooked in giving the cabin a period-correct look including the Houndstooth bucket seats and full-length center console, and one notable upgrade is the vintage-looking stereo system that is actually a modern AM/FM radio with hidden USB and Aux ports."

This engine packs a 350-horsepower punch, and thanks to an upgraded aftermarket exhaust system, you won't miss this big-block Camaro when it's approaching. Backing up its looks, this Camaro is sure to be an excellent cruiser thanks to power steering and power front disc brakes."
