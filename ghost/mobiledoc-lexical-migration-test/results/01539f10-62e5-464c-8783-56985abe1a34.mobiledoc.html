<p>Air cooled Porsches have a way of engendering <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/6082/1964-porsche-356-c&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a certain affection</a> in their owners. It's the only way to explain their meteoric rise in value over the last few years, fueled by the evangelical, almost cultish behavior of their owners and admirers.</p>

<p>It's always been like this, though. A great example of that is this car right here. This <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/6082/1964-porsche-356-c&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1964 Porsche 356 C coupe</a> is being sold on consignment through Worldwide Vintage Autos of Denver, Colorado by its first and only owner.</p>
<p>The owner of <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/6082/1964-porsche-356-c&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this white 356 C</a> purchased the car new, and had the good fortune of owning one of the last – and the best – 356s ever built. Over a period of over 50 years, they've driven and enjoyed this beautiful machine, rolling the odometer over at least once.</p>

<p>We can't say we blame them. <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/6082/1964-porsche-356-c&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The 356 C</a> was powered by a 1600cc boxer four making up to 95 horsepower. It featured several other updates over the 356 B, such as four wheel disc brakes.</p>
<p>They're among <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/6082/1964-porsche-356-c&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the best 356s to drive</a>, maintaining the classic, beloved "bathtub" look while offering superior performance and livability improvements over previous models. A 356C would definitely be our pick for a driver.</p>
