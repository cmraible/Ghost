It all started when someone didn’t lock the guy’s Dodge Challenger. In the trunk of the Mopar were about 40 keys from cars belonging to the business, including the maroon 2014 Chevy Camaro SS which was sitting in the driveway of the dealership owner’s private residence."

However, there are still adults who don’t lock up their vehicle when they leave it. This isn’t a great idea during the daytime, but at night it’s even worse."

Instead of having to take the keys out of your pocket or purse when approaching the car, we now just have to press buttons and that’s it. Some have taken it a step further and just leave the key in their car all the time. Is this the fate of humanity? Are we really this lazy and stupid? Stay tuned as we dig further into this laughable problem."
