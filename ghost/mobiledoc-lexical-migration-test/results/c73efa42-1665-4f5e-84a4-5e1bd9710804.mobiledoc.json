Back to seats and eyeballs, channelled not connected, “audiences” sucking up linear “content”? Back to a time where discourse wasn’t possible, where law-of-the-jungle-might-was-right, and visceral emotion was the preferred means of communication?\n\nThere’s a deep irony in the fact that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter *et al* have simplified the tools of the Web 2.0 era to the point where they’ve re-created the conditions of the pre-social web – but with lower barriers to entry.\n\nAnd that means that the determined, and the well-funded, can start reshaping what was once personal discourse in a controlled fashion. Essentially, we’ve created the conditions for highly politicised propaganda to insert itself into people’s normals social interactions, *without them noticing*.\n\nAnd much that is bad has stemmed from that.\n\n[<span style=\"display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px;\"><svg style=\"height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-1px;fill:white;\" viewbox=\"0 0 32 32\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><title></title><path d=\"M20.8 18.1c0 2.7-2.2 4.8-4.8 4.8s-4.8-2.1-4.8-4.8c0-2.7 2.2-4.8 4.8-4.8 2.7.1 4.8 2.2 4.8 4.8zm11.2-7.4v14.9c0 2.3-1.9 4.3-4.3 4.3h-23.4c-2.4 0-4.3-1.9-4.3-4.3v-15c0-2.3 1.9-4.3 4.3-4.3h3.7l.8-2.3c.4-1.1 1.7-2 2.9-2h8.6c1.2 0 2.5.9 2.9 2l.8 2.4h3.7c2.4 0 4.3 1.9 4.3 4.3zm-8.6 7.5c0-4.1-3.3-7.5-7.5-7.5-4.1 0-7.5 3.4-7.5 7.5s3.3 7.5 7.5 7.5c4.2-.1 7.5-3.4 7.5-7.5z\"></path></svg></span><span style=\"display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px;\">Priscilla Du Preez</span>](https://unsplash.com/@priscilladupreez?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=photographer-credit&utm_content=creditBadge \"Download free do whatever you want high-resolution photos from Priscilla Du Preez\")\n\n\n"
