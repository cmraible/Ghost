Of course you’d probably never do that in real life but it makes for a cool premise on the big screen. However these thieves apparently did not get the memo that you’re not exactly supposed to steal cars before they took 26 high end luxury automobiles from a dealership.",

However, if these were truly the minds of cars eluded to then it’s possible there was a lot more damage than just that. ",

Because of this, nobody knows what the thieves even look like. So the rest was pretty simple, cutting bolted locks and gates before eventually hijacking the cars themselves. It’s likely the previous heist mentioned before was sort of a trial run as they stole 19 cars at a value of $900,000. There will likely be many more occurrences like this as the team moves through various dealerships in the area. Let’s just hope somebody stops them before they steal even more automobiles.",
