<p>Everyone dreams of owning a rare, super cool car. Usually those are imagined as something exotic and likely more expensive than you could ever afford. That’s not the case with this <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28367/1971-buick-gs?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 Buick GS</a>. A knee jerk reaction is to think Buicks aren’t really rare creatures, but this particular model only had a production run of under 600 for 1971, so there aren’t exactly a lot rolling around today. It also presents incredibly well, so you get a great and rare car, but you better act quick. This Buick will be auctioned off soon by <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a>.</p>

<p>The big block 455 cubic inch V8 pumps a mighty 315-hosepower and 450 lb.-ft. of torque out, which is considerable especially for 1971. This is a true enthusiast’s car, also using a 400 Turbo transmission and a 373 gear posi, perfect for driving aggressively. Seriously, you can really smoke a lot of tires with this setup, or just intimidate everyone with that deep V8 rumble, thanks to 3-inch headers.</p>
<p>While this old American muscle car has plenty of performance to impress, the exterior is also quite nice, so you can park it and still wow passersby. The Harvest Gold paint is in great shape, easily able to reflect any light for a nice, smooth look. You’ll also notice the black vinyl roof is in good repair, which is an important detail to note on these cars. All the factory badging and trim is in place, while the chrome on parts like the bumpers is mirror-like.</p>
<p>The factory tilt wheel and controls are included, along with the tachometer and gauge pack that were on the car from the beginning. You also enjoy the original air conditioning.  There are some modern upgrades, especially Bluetooth so you can connect your smartphone and play music that way.</p>
<p>Offered as an option for the base Buick GS for the 1971 and 1972 model years, it wasn’t a huge seller for 1971. This good-looking car comes via California and has papers, so you can pour over its history.</p>
