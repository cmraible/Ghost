<p>The <a title="Rumor: Apple iPhone Event Planned for September 10" href="__GHOST_URL__/2013/08/10/rumor-apple-iphone-event-planned-for-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10 iPhone event</a> is right around the corner and we’re getting some more leaks coming out.  This time it’s photos of that rumored gold or “champagne” colored iPhone (seen above and below).  The photos of the gold iPhone 5S come from Japanese website <em><a href="http://weekly.ascii.jp/elem/000/000/165/165280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASCII</a></em> and they more realistic than any of the other photos that have made their way into public thus far.</p>
<p>Apple will also release the <a title="iOS 7 Unveiled at Apple’s WWDC" href="__GHOST_URL__/2013/06/10/apple-unveils-ios-7-at-wwdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vastly redesigned</a> iOS 7 at next month’s event, and is reportedly developing a line of <a title="VIDEO: iPhone 5C Compared to Previous Generation iPhones" href="__GHOST_URL__/2013/08/14/video-iphone-5c-compared-to-previous-generation-iphones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-cost, multi-colored</a> iPhones (dubbed the iPhone 5C).  While it remains unclear whether the company will announce its rumored budget line next month or at a later date, it has been reported that Apple has been <a title="Apple asks Foxconn to ship both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C in September" href="__GHOST_URL__/2013/08/19/apple-asks-foxconn-to-ship-both-iphone-5s-and-iphone-5c-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pushing Foxconn to have both iPhones ready for launch</a> in September.  Whether that happens or not remains to be seen, I guess we’ll find out soon enough.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2013/08/exclusive-high-resolution-photos-of-the-rumored-gold-iphone-5s-back-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Advice</a> has just posted some additional photos of the new Gold iPhone. These photos include the completed back panel of the iPhone with top and bottom pieces in place. You can also see the device’s SIM tray, volume adjuster, and other buttons.  Plus, the elongated camera flash cutout gives some credibility to a dual LED rumor for the next iPhone.</p>
