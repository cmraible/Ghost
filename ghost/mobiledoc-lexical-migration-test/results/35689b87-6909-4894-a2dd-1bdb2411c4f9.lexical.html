<p>Although there is surely more to it that this, Carrol Shelby had a simple equation that he followed with his <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/backdraft-rt4-cobra">Cobras</a>. The most potent engine that will fit plus a super light body equals an incredibly fast roadster. We can argue who exactly came up with that formula first but one thing is for sure, since then many people have tried to improve upon it. In 2001, Tony Marten and Reg Dodd did just that with the <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/backdraft-rt4-cobra">creation of Backdraft</a> Racing. Their company has become well known for its innovative approach to the Cobra Kit Car.</p>

<p>Essentially, Backdraft Racing delivers a race proven designed rolling chassis ready for the powertrain of the customer’s choice. How wicked <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/backdraft-rt4-cobra">the Roadster</a> gets from there is completely up to the end user but we can’t think of a more appropriate or more powerful option than a <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/backdraft-rt4-cobra">480-horsepower Roush 427-cid SRX</a> engine backed by a TREMEC TKO 5 Speed Manual Transmission. For those wondering how that translates in the real world, 500-lb-ft of torque out of a 2,400-lbs car is enough to rocket to 60-mph in just 3.5-seconds. Throw in the iconic styling of a Guardsman Blue finish with a Wimbledon White racing stripe, 18-inch knock-off wheels wrapped in Nitto tires, a 304 stainless steel side exhaust, black leather bucket seats, and a wood steering wheel and you have one head turning roadster.</p>
