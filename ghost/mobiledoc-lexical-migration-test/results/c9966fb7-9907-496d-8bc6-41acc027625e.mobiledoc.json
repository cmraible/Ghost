Because it’s relaxed and entertaining, it’s jam-packed with some of the greatest cars in the world, and there are enough auctions and sideshows to keep you busy for three or more days.

And a lot of men (and a few women) in baseball caps and Bonneville T-shirts of varying vintages helping to coax those engines into life. Every now and again a car or motorcycles roars off the line and spears off into the distance as onlookers hold their collective breaths until the run has been completed safely. At which point they hold their breaths until the timekeeper confirms the top speed. It’s madness, increasingly at threat due to the deterioration of the salt flats, and a strange piece of heaven for any petrolhead."

Possibly the most civilised classic car event ever know, a concours that concentrates on the elegance of the cars, the people and the surroundings – the last of which is the renowned French chateau 45km north of Paris. There are equestrian displays, fashion shows, art classes and even rides on classic boats. Amid it all are some of the greatest cars ever made, not just old ones but brand new concept cars and coachbuilts too. We feel relaxed just thinking about it."

          " is incredible, but the Classic is in many ways better, because the crowds are smaller, the visitors more civilised, and the cars more evocative. The racing isn’t continuous because it’s broken into six different classes (’plateaus’) which get three races each throughout the 24 hours. But the sight of, say, a 917, tearing past, lights ablaze, makes up for the pauses between races."

          "If you haven’t experienced it, you may wonder if the Mille Miglia is as mad as you’ve heard. It is. The Italians go wild for it, just as they did in its heyday between 1927 and 1957 – though back then the competitors raced the full 1000 miles non-stop. Nowadays it’s open to cars of a type that competed in the original, and it takes places over three days, but it’s still a challenge. Most of all, you won’t forget the experience of policemen waving you through red lights, police motorcycle riders urging you to go faster, and crowds cheering your way through every village, town and city. If you can’t take part, just book yourself into one of those locations and watch the historic automotive circus come to town."

          "We’ve cheated a bit here, bringing an entire week of events into one week. But at least two of those events – Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance and Monterey Motorsports Reunion – would have made it into the Top Ten anyway. Pebble is the most famous concours in the world, and you’ll see cars there that you’ll never see anywhere again, while the Motorsports Reunion is great racing at the superb Laguna Seca circuit. On top of those you have The Quail, Concorso Italiano, Concours on the Avenue, the Little Car Show, Ferraris at the Barn, Legends of the Autobarn, Werks Reunion, the utterly brilliant (and hilarious) Concours d’LeMons and more, including eight major auctions. Despite heavy traffic and high costs, it’s a remarkable week in a beautiful area."

          "There are so many remarkable long-distance rallies but for sheer audacity and once-in-a-lifetime experience, we don’t think there’s anything to beat the late Philip Young’s remarkable rally, inspired by the original first run in 1907. Don’t misunderstand us, for this is a gruelling event, challenging beyond belief as teams battle through the harshest environments, such as the Mongolian desert, their pre-1976 cars taking the harshest battering you can imagine. But it’s an experience you’ll never ever forget. It’s only the few who’ll be able to take part but how about heading to Paris to wave in the finishers?"
