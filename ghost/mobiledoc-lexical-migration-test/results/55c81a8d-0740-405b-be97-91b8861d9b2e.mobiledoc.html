<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Over the last week, <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s follow-the-money reporting has been breaking open one of the biggest stories of this perilous moment: the story of how Wall Street lobbyists and politicians have made it far harder to target Vladimir Putin and his oligarch network.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/684442641">our new video</a> about the situation — and then <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyPoster/status/1499595730532528128?s=20&t=PMkx81N05KoTntPS8uLLWg">share it on social media</a> and forward this email to friends and family.</p>

<p>We also discussed our reporting on the matter in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMvKrkPZB3k">our new segment</a> on <em>Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar — </em>a video that has already attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>We don’t answer to Wall Street billionaires. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which means we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-ukraine-plans-face-wall-street-roadblock/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-administration-may-shield-bank-linked-to-russian-oligarchs/">this</a> that those billionaires want to keep suppressed. We can also show how President Biden has the power to fix the problem — but has so far refused.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
