That’s right, that boxy Grumman LLV which delivers and sometimes loses your mail forever is getting the high-performance makeover from the California-based artist, and boy is it wild!"

I say that because Foose seems to think the mail should be delivered quicker, and there I was just concerned with my Amazon package not showing as “In Transit” for 3 weeks with zero answers from USPS. But no, giving them a cool-looking truck with flame-spewing headers should be a top priority."

The chassis, which was borrowed from the Chevy S10, couldn’t handle the kind of power he’s dreaming of. Also, the body wouldn’t even be used, he says, so it would be a one-off fabrication like the chassis. In other words, this build in real life would be inspired by mail trucks but wouldn’t be one. Yep, he’s really got some great ideas here."

It has a nice raked stance, exposed blower, wheel bar, and huge roof-mounted wing hinting at extreme performance. Oh Foose, what have you done? And what is he going to do next time?"
