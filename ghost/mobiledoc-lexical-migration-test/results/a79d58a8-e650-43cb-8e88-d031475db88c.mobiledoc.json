That’s especially true if you really love your ride instead of just looking at it as something that gets you from one place to another. With car thefts rampant in quite a few areas, you might at some point experience these feelings for yourself. And while it’s tempting to just give up on your car being found after it’s missing for weeks or months, a story out of the United Kingdom should give you some hope."

Maybe you could buy it off of them, but once you sign the paperwork and transfer the title over so you can get that check, the car is no longer yours. We wouldn’t tell you to not sign paperwork and get the money because the chances of seeing your car whole and in good shape after it’s stolen still aren’t great. But it sure is nice to hear of a happy ending once in a while."
