Well, we have seen truck-boat hybrids before, but none looked quite like this one. Plus, what makes this pickup truck gliding across the water even more unique is in at least one video included with this article shows it racing other boats."

It looks like someone welded the truck onto a boat, but we’re not sure if it’s just the body or the frame as well, but doing just the body would make more sense. Either way, they decided to attach the wheels, we’re sure for the fully ridiculous effect of seeing an old pickup truck gliding across the water."

The old pickup truck hits the air like a giant slab, pushing it with extreme effort instead of slicing through, like what more modern performance boats do. Still, the guy who owns this creative conversion is out there giving it his all and no doubt having a blast. We have to salute whoever owns this pickup truck turned into a boat, because he definitely knows how to have a good time."
