          "YouTuber Ratarossa has acquired a Ferrari 512 BBi with only 6,420 miles on the odometer, however it’s incredibly dirty after sitting unwashed for 12 years. While your average person might just run such a car through a commercial car or spray it down with a garden hose, the guy knows a special Italian vehicle needs to be treated better. That’s where professional detailers Ammo NYC step in to help this barn find get a proper bath."

Before anyone starts to disparage the Ferrari 512 BBi, values have been holding overall fairly steady recently and they’re often past the $200,000 mark. In other words, this car definitely is worthy of a professional detailing."

However, modern technology allowed for Ammo products to be sent to the owner while he gets instructions via FaceTime on how to go through the process. That makes the video a little extra interesting"
