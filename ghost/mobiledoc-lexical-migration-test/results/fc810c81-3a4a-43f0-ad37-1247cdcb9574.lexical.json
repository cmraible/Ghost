Still, that doesn’t mean thieves can’t use that to their advantage. Key fobs broadcast a short radio wave, which with the right equipment criminals can capture and broadcast to the car by standing right outside your house. This is why we urge anyone who parks their vehicle with keyless ignition outside to place their keys in a Faraday cage when they’re not in use. That blocks the signal and keeps the vehicle safer.",
