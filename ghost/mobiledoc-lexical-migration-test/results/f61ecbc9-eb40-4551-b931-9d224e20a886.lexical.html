<hr>
<p>Back in 1991, <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/vehicle-details/?show_vehicle=175605&current_index=3&total_results=29&tsauction_id=209&=&caryear=&caryearto=&search_text=&page=featured&showpage=2">Dodge debuted the Viper</a> to the unsuspecting public, and it received a ton of attention from the consumers as well as the automotive community. When you look at the other American cars being produced around the same time, it is clear that the Viper was definitely ahead of its time. Additionally, the first examples were put together in record time as well. Exactly two years from the start date, one of the pre-production models piloted by Carroll Shelby kicked off and kept pace for the 1991 Indianapolis 500. Later that year, Dodge provided car reviewers and media access to the car and began delivering pre-ordered cars first thing in 1992.</p>

Engineers were constantly improving on the design and each generation of the model brought vast improvements over the last.</p>
