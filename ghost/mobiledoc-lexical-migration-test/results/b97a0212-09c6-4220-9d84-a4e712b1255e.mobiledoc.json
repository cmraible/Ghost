          " is a visual novel that follows the story of Akane Kakeru, a teenage boy born with a hemangioma below his right eye. This birth defect is a benign tumour with the appearance of large red blisters; it has led Kakeru to suffer from severe social anxiety and depression, resulting in his constant need to shy away from attention through fear of being laughed and gawked at. As the story unfolds, we meet Fujiwara Haraku, a shy young girl often found alone in a music room with her flute. Haraku is blind and therefore cannot see Kakeru's face, which allows for some long-lost confidence to return and a beautiful friendship to blossom."

          " shines in its ability to tell a beautiful story. I often found myself getting caught up in the blossoming relationship between Kakeru and Haruka, becoming fully immersed in the story that develops between the two and watching each overcoming their own anxieties and insecurities was truly touching. The moments shared between the two are tender and reminded me of the early days of a friendship/relationship where you awkwardly blunder through until you realise that no matter your funny little quirks, this person likes you. It’s a beautiful reflection by the developers on how we all have our insecurities but letting them hold us back means that we might just watch life go by."

They are not straight snapshots as there's a level of brush-up to them, which accentuates focus onto the character in attention - very clever!"
