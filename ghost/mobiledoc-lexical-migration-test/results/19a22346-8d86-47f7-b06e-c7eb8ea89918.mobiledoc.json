As parents we always hate hearing stories like this one, especially since we remember when our peers were acting like they could do anything behind the wheel and walk away unharmed. Even worse is when adults behave the same way, setting a poor example for kids."

That impact sent the Mustang spinning out of control. It hit a light pole, the rear axle and the rear portion of the body ripping off, left sitting a good distance from the rest of the Ford."

We don’t know how fast the Mustang was going at the time of impact, but from the looks of things we’d have to guess it was well over the speed limit. Yes, speeding itself doesn’t kill, but it does mean you have to react faster to hazards and other drivers might not see you coming in time."
