<hr>
<p>The car meets of the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11407">late 1990s and early 2000s</a> were filled with what would become the beginning of the move towards the next muscle car era. Lots filled with Camaro’s, Mustangs, and the great late Firebird’s were the norm and rarely did anyone show up in anything different. An Occasional classic would show up every now and then showing the American car community at least a little bit of diversity but one of the most unique sightings came in the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11407">form of a truck</a>.</p>

<p>In 1997, <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11407">Ford saw a gap</a> in the automotive marketplace. Trucks were starting to gain in popularity for personal use which led to the tenth generation F-150. Although sportier than any other truck on the road, the F-150 was far from what is considered a 'sports truck.' In fact, there was nothing on the road at that time that came directly from the factory that would make it into this category and so Ford’s Special Vehicle Team resurrected a legendary name: <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11407">Lightning</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11407">1999 Ford F150 Lightning</a> truck being offered by Carlisle Auctions is like brand new. With a 5.4-liter engine, this truck was made to be driven but instead was preserved in a private Ford collection with just 8,280 original miles on the clock. Inside, special Alcantara and carbon fiber seats add a little bit of sporty flair to the red F-150s gray interior.</p>
