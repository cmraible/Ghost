<p>The Metropolitan is an interesting little car it’s somewhat of a novelty, some might call it kitschy, and it’s often not taken very seriously. These sub-compact economy cars really stood out during their time when others cars were getting bigger and bigger, and they really stand out against the SUV-cluttered roads today. Another intriguing thing about them as how many celebrities owned one, at some point.</p>

<p>Did you know Steve Jobs' first car was a Metropolitan? Know you do! In 1970, when he was 15 years old. his father bought the Nash and Steve wasn't really a fan. In his biography, he talks about the car, saying “In retrospect, a Nash Metropolitan might seem like the most wickedly cool car,” he says in the new biography, <em>Steve Jobs</em>, “but at the time it was the most uncool car in the world.”</p>

<p>American actor, film director, race car driver, and entrepreneur, Paul Newman, is said to have owned a Nash Metropolitan at some point. Details on this one are pretty murky, other than someone pinning it as being yellow and black when they purchased it from him.</p>

<p>Elvis loved cars, and had tons of them, so why not a Metropolitan. Oddly enough, we can't find the exact one or a picture, strange considering he's one of the most famous car collectors in the world. We did find a news article from 2007 that said it was almost burned in a Malibu fire, but was saved. The car pictures did not belong to Elvis, but it is for sale, <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1959-Hudson-Metropolitan/lotInformation/61193108">see it here.</a></p>

<p>The Margaritaville singer has an appropriately plated Metropolitan. A few stories can be found around the internet of people seeing him drive it, or taking pictures with him and the little car after seeing it in a parking lot.</p>
