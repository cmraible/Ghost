<h2 id="this-is-what-biden-says-is-a-%E2%80%9Cbig-win%E2%80%9D">This Is What Biden Says Is A ‚ÄúBig Win‚Äù</h2>
<p>By David Sirota</p>
<p>President <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/joe-biden/">Biden</a> had his ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù moment this week when his White House <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewJBates46/status/1664229402610225152">took to social media</a> to tout this week‚Äôs debt ceiling deal as a ‚Äúmajor Biden administration victory.‚Äù</p>
<p>The endzone football spike was an abrupt shift from Democrats previously depicting the debt ceiling deal‚Äôs spending cuts, Pentagon budget increases, and fossil fuel giveaways as an unfortunate-but-unavoidable compromise that at least prevented a catastrophic default.</p>
<p>Now, we‚Äôre asked by Democrats and their <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/steve-rattner-the-white-house-deserves-a-victory-lap-on-the-debt-deal-179041861958">media machine</a> to believe that this wasn‚Äôt a reluctant rearguard defensive action, it was instead a triumph ‚Äî Biden‚Äôs very own LBJ-esque display of successful arm-twisting and masterful negotiation that delivered a ‚Äúbig win,‚Äù in the president‚Äôs own words, which he amplified in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-tout-debt-limit-deal-in-first-major-oval-office-address-a3ae7c22">his first Oval Office address</a>.</p>
<p>This tonal change is as much a celebration as it is an admission ‚Äî one providing a rare moment of honesty and clarity.</p>
<p>It tells us that this deal is exactly what Democrats always wanted.</p>
<p>It also tells us precisely what Democratic leaders believe is a win ‚Äî and for whom they want to secure such victories.</p>

<h3 id="to-the-victors-go-the-spoils">To The Victors Go The Spoils</h3>
<p>In this deal, big corporations, private equity moguls, and the affluent class all scored wins when both parties prevented the bill from including tax reforms, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/05/15/debt-ceiling-negotiations-deadline-default/">closing tax loopholes</a> and repealing high-income tax cuts. This, even though <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/">data</a> show that recent tax cuts were primarily responsible for growth in the debt‚Äôs proportional size.</p>
<p>The rich also got a big victory in the bill‚Äôs provisions <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2023/05/28/debt-deal-cuts-21-billion-of-irs-80-billion-87000-new-irs-agents-stay/">gutting funding</a> for tax enforcement. </p>
<p><a href="https://popular.info/p/there-is-always-more-money-for-defense">Defense contracting industry donors</a> got their own win when both parties agreed to boost the Pentagon‚Äôs annual budget to <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2023/05/29/debt-ceiling-agreement-locks-in-bidens-proposed-defense-budget/">nearly $900 billion</a> ‚Äî a <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/federal-contracting/record-us-defense-budget-is-emerging-immune-from-congress-cuts">record size</a>. At the same time the legislation implements a dark-money-funded <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dark-moneys-behind-the-debt-ceiling-plan-to-punish-the-poor/">conservative group‚Äôs initiative</a> designed to make it more difficult for the poorest people to <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/debt-ceiling-agreements-snap-changes-would-increase-hunger-and-poverty-for">access food stamps</a>.</p>
<p>Executives at private student lending companies ‚Äî which have been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/18/private-lenders-lobby-student-loan-payments-00018363">furiously lobbying</a> lawmakers ‚Äî won when both parties used the deal to end a moratorium on student debt payments for federal borrowers. One of the largest lenders‚Äô stock price <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/sofi-stock-price-student-loans-8f69f12f">began rising</a> as the deal neared completion.</p>
<p>And as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/17/global-heating-climate-crisis-record-temperatures-wmo-research">climate emergency worsens</a>, fossil fuel industry donors grabbed <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-administration-approves-controversial-willow-oil-drilling-project-in-alaska">yet another</a><a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/biden-administration-oil-gas-drilling-approvals-outpace-trumps-2023-01-24/">win</a> in the form of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/debt-deal-gives-fossil-fuel-lobby-a-legal-shield/">massive gas pipeline</a> that will not only be expedited, but also exempted from any court challenge ‚Äî a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/debt-deal-gives-fossil-fuel-lobby-a-legal-shield/">judicial shield</a> that Democrats have never tried to extend to abortion rights, civil rights or voting rights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the deal omits any provisions to speed up the construction of transmission lines for clean energy projects, and may actually make that kind of permitting reform <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-06-02-manchin-pipeline-payoff-future-permitting-reform/">more difficult in the future</a>.</p>

<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cit-takes-too-much-time%E2%80%9D">‚ÄúIt Takes Too Much Time‚Äù</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs obvious that Republicans always wanted this outcome. They proudly and honestly shout their support for this agenda from the floors of both congressional chambers. Democrats usually do something more deceptive ‚Äî they pretend they love the progressive agenda, hate what‚Äôs happening, and then vote for it anyway.</p>
<p>But with much of the American Left crushed into fine dust and a non-factor in Washington, the party‚Äôs leaders are no longer bothering with pretense. More often than not, they are letting the mask drop and doing what they did this time around.</p>
<p>The early tell came in the lame duck session of Congress, when Democrats could have passed a clean debt ceiling increase via <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/11/01/say-it-aint-so-reconciliation-back-on-the-table-for-raising-debt-limit/">reconciliation</a>, but chose not to. Knowing the left has little deterrent power and knowing how few liberals care about anything other than watching MSNBC, party leaders didn‚Äôt even feel the need to provide the public with a legitimate reason for inaction. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin just came right out and <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/11/16/massive-mistake-alarm-dems-cast-doubt-lame-duck-debt-ceiling-deal#:~:text=%22That%20would%20not%20be%20done,much%20else%20on%20the%20agenda.%22">said</a> he and his colleagues didn‚Äôt feel like making space on the congressional calendar to do it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat would not be done this year by reconciliation ‚Äî it takes too much time,‚Äù Durbin <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/bid-democrats-raise-us-debt-173533669.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMoewMJdkFWuZytqrhsZ4RcJ5q2UtLVdIFYrVldJUTJLDKx7EjHlK4IcsE9C_hlvGmoXsXkBb0Bk79eieiBTr0JnF3FpjSG9jMOFg8DhHqX8UviEyhg6YOJeLDXzwEFBCmeCQ_0jyU_7FGi7jyovvelvoELTStT8PBfNuC3wgzXe">said</a> in November, despite pleading to do so from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-03/sanders-wants-to-increase-debt-limit-if-republicans-win-to-save-social-security?srnd=fixed-income&sref=v0V36m7t">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/yellen-says-us-debt-ceiling-hike-by-lame-duck-congress-would-be-great-2022-11-13/">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen</a> among others. ‚ÄúWe have three weeks and there is too much else on the agenda.‚Äù</p>
<p>If by that point you didn‚Äôt realize this was all a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-debt-ceiling-standoff-has-been-a-performance/">Washington Generals/Harlem Globetrotters game</a> with a predetermined outcome, Biden made it explicit when the debt ceiling came back up last month.</p>
<p>Rather than taking a stand, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/19/biden-14th-amendment-debt-ceiling-00097930">stomped on</a> Democratic lawmakers calling for him to use the constitution‚Äôs 14th amendment to bypass Republicans‚Äô predictable hostage game. Knowing liberals would obediently accept the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make the perfect the enemy of the good‚Äù canard, Biden pretended he had no power to do anything other than bow to GOP demands, even when <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/05/debt-ceiling-joe-biden-administration-republican-hostage-taking">that was patently false</a>.</p>
<p>Then as soon as the monstrous package of budget cuts and fossil fuel giveaways was cobbled together, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/19/biden-14th-amendment-debt-ceiling-00097930"><em>Politico</em></a> reported that Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúteam went into overdrive,‚Äù placing ‚Äúover 100 one-on-one calls with House Democrats‚Äù and holding ‚Äúwonky virtual meetings over the negotiation details.‚Äù</p>
<p>The pressure was wildly successful ‚Äî not only did the debt deal pass by wide margins in <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023243">both</a><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1181/vote_118_1_00146.htm">chambers</a>, Senate Democrats also joined Republicans in <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1181/vote_118_1_00145.htm">killing</a> an amendment to strip the pipeline out of the legislation. It was the kind of blitzkrieg ‚Äî <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewJBates46/status/1664229402610225152">flaunted on social media</a> by the White House‚Äôs deputy press secretary ‚Äî that has never been deployed by Biden to enact policies that would help millions of Americans, like his promised $15 minimum wage or a public health insurance option, both of which remain absolutely nowhere in the political conversation.</p>

<p>And so now here we are with a deal that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is celebrating ‚Äî a deal that the <a href="https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/one-more-republican-needs-to-go-head-of-cbo/">Republican-led</a> Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-06-01-cbo-claim-snap-work-requirements-highly-suspect/">desperately tried to sugarcoat</a>, but that a major Democratic Party-aligned budget think tank <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/debt-ceiling-agreement-reflects-improvements-over-house-bill-harmful-provisions">admits</a> will ‚Äúincrease hunger and poverty‚Äù and ‚Äúput hundreds of thousands of older adults aged 50-54 at risk of losing food assistance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Perhaps such a bitter pill could be more easily ramrodded down America‚Äôs gagging throat if most Democrats were at least pretending that this was the best they could do and at least performatively faking a bit of sadness about the agreement‚Äôs horrors. But other than a <a href="https://twitter.com/democracynow/status/1664608933775032320?s=42">handful</a> of lawmakers admitting the brutal truth about what happened, it‚Äôs been the opposite.</p>
<p>Far from being ashamed of the outcome, the Democratic White House is <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2023/06/02/biden--mccarthy-taking-victory-laps-on-debt-limit-despite-criticisms">declaring</a> this ‚Äúa big win for our economy and the American people,‚Äù all while MSNBC <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseStudyQB/status/1664297573744623617">lauds</a> progressive lawmakers not for standing up to the atrocity, but for loyally falling in line and providing votes to make it a reality.</p>
<p>In light of this, one might see Democrats in the same way <em>Succession</em>‚Äôs Logan Roy viewed his bumbling children ‚Äî as ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk">not serious people.</a>‚Äù But these Washington politicians are deadly serious.</p>
<p>For decades, Biden has made <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-austerity-rhetoric-returns-from-the-memory-hole/">explicitly clear</a> just how serious he is about forging alliances with Republicans to freeze or cut government spending. He literally <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4796183/user-clip-biden-1995-discusses-past-support-freezing-entitlement-spending">delivered</a><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4843746/user-clip-biden-freezing-social-security">speeches</a> on the Senate floor bragging about how many times he‚Äôs tried to do it.</p>
<p>His dream now coming true makes clear how serious he and his party‚Äôs congressional caucus are about simultaneously delivering for their big donors while insisting with a straight face that they really support a progressive agenda that would challenge those donors‚Äô wealth and power.</p>
<p>The accurate conclusion about Democratic leaders, then, is the axiom <a href="https://twitter.com/successionreact/status/1662557634635915266?s=20">uttered</a> by Logan‚Äôs dejected son Kendall: ‚ÄúPeople who say they love you also f*ck you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Until rank-and-file Democratic voters admit that painful truth about their party bosses ‚Äî and are willing to challenge them and their ethos in primary elections ‚Äî Biden will remain the same austerian he‚Äôs always been, and Democratic politicians will continue allying with Republicans for ‚Äúbig wins‚Äù that protect the rich, pulverize the working class and destroy the livable climate.</p>
