Looking forward into the future, Adam, who is now all grown up, looks back on what has happened as a terrible tragedy that he wants to change. Using his extensive knowledge in the field of technology, science and advanced AI, he builds a time machine and a charming little robot who he intends to send back to that fateful day to change the outcome forever."
