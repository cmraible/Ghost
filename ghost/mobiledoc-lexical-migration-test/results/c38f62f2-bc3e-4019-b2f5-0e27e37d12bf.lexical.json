Once the exchange of cash for your new car has commenced, you then go to get a title at which time you promptly met with the realization that it is a stolen vehicle and the police confiscated it as evidence. This is precisely the situation that is happening in the Houston area of Texas right now and it appears that the only way to prevent it from happening to you is to watch out for any odd behavior when purchasing a car. Hopefully, the scheme will be put to an end by Houston Police but until then, this is a major issue affecting Texans and anyone purchasing a vehicle through social media really should watch out for the signs of fraud.",
