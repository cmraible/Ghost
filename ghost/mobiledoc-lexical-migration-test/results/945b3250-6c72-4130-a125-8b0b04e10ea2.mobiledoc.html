<p><a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/1583/1986-cadillac-fleetwood">Cadillac has</a> always been renowned for its gargantuan luxury cars such as the El Dorados and Devilles. However, it hit a peak of producing cars of titanic proportions and luxury with the introduction of the Fleetwood model. In a time where other manufacturers were focusing on fuel economy and searching for ways to make their vehicles more compact, Cadillac stretched the Fleetwoodâ€™s wheelbase to 130-inches and fitted it with one of the largest displacement engines available. With a choice of different engines, plush upholstery, and the most luxury ever fitted in an American car, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1974-cadillac-fleetwood-talisman/">Fleetwood</a> continued to offer the best driving experience for personal luxury buyers. Check out two you can put in your garage today.</p>
