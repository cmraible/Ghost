Anyway, all of them have been pretty much theÂ same old stuff you would expect to receive &#8212; that is, until today when I received this magnificent <em>thing</em> in my inbox. I present the best worst CES pitch of 2016.</p>\n<p>I have no speech.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/worst-ces-pitch.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-43579\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43579\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/worst-ces-pitch.png\" alt=\"worst-ces-pitch\" width=\"621\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/worst-ces-pitch.png 621w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/worst-ces-pitch-300x171.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/worst-ces-pitch-600x341.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/01/worst-ces-pitch-610x347.png 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m all for keeping it short and sweet, but I have no idea what &#8220;this story&#8221; is &#8212; and for the record, I didn&#8217;t open the press release. I hate press releases. I loathe them. Despise them.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn how to pitch me, check out my profile in Blonde 2.0&#8217;s &#8220;How To Pitch Me&#8221; series.
