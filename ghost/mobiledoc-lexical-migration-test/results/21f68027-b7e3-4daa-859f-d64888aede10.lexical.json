First of all, there aren’t really that many classic car owners out there and your level of success will highly vary depending on Your location. On top of that, it’s not like after your car has been restored it needs to be restored again so the big way shops make money is by servicing the vehicles, something classic cars will never be out of a need for. Regardless of the cost, Richard Hammond is constantly looking for new ways to improve his business model and hopefully he can make it a full-time gig given enough time.",
