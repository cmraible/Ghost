Each puzzle will work your logical thinking as you plan out what needs to go where, and how certain abilities and objects can be used to assist you. Along the way, there are many different tools at your disposal that you’ll find in tin outposts that are located in some stages. To unlock them, simply walk a tin soldier into one of the outposts to acquire a useful tool, which range from blocks that you can possess, a clock that allows you to stop time giving you time to plan out a safe route, speeding up time, and rewinding time if mistakes happen."
