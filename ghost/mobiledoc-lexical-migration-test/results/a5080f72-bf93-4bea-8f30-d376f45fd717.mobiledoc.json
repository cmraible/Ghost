          " were a great time for fans of the iconic Porsche brand of cars. Auto Racing had taken off in Europe, and buyers wanted something to reflect the hunger for speed that now engulfed the growing sports car market. For Germany, the prancy pony of performance was the frontrunner in the charge to take the hearts and minds of automotive enthusiasts across the globe. This goal was accomplished quite well, especially with cars such as the 911, which pioneered the path for similar lightweight sports cars whose primary focus was on the experience of driving and all of the pleasures that come with that. This car perfectly epitomizes that intense concentration on giving the driver a beautifully crafted ride."

          " is a 2.4-liter flat-six, which sits behind the rear axle of this prized pony producing 165 horsepower. That power transfers through a five-speed manual transaxle; this winning combination adds up to a top speed of around 150mph which is insane for this car. In addition, many of the mechanical parts have been refurbished and restored to near-perfect condition, which means that you’ll get to enjoy the vehicle exactly how it is supposed to be. Initially, the car came with many additional options still prevalent on the vehicle due to this restoration process. "

A floor-mounted shifter is responsible for shifting, which perfectly accents the rest of the car and its driver-focused design. Everything from the beautifully crafted powerhouse to the iconic Porsche exterior styling screams one word, fast!"
