<p>Three of the biggest oil and gas companies posted more than $40 billion in quarterly profits this week, as Americans’ pain at the pump from Big Oil’s price gouging continues to be a key factor in the election.</p>
<p>Such outsized profits suggest Democrats’ attempts to curtail Big Oil’s profiteering through rhetoric alone have failed, and that the pain of high gas prices and other financial hardships <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/400565/inflation-causing-hardship-majority.aspx">plaguing a majority of Americans</a> will continue.</p>
<p>ExxonMobil posted its biggest quarter ever on Friday, with nearly $20 billion in earnings during the third quarter of this year. This was a 191 percent increase from the $6.75 billion it raked in during Q3 2021.</p>
<p>Chevron reported similarly robust results on Friday. The California-based oil giant’s <a href="https://www.chevron.com/newsroom/2022/q4/chevron-announces-3q-2022-results">third-quarter earnings</a> of $11.2 billion were its second-highest quarterly returns ever, nearly double its earnings during <a href="https://www.chevron.com/newsroom/2021/q4/chevron-announces-third-quarter-2021-results">Q3 2021</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Shell reported <a href="https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/quarterly-results/2022/q3-2022.html">$9.5 billion</a> in earnings over the last three months, more than double the <a href="https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/quarterly-results/2021/q3-2021.html">$4.1 billion</a> it earned during the same period last year. In its report to investors, the oil and gas giant announced a $4-billion round of stock buybacks, creating yet another windfall for investors and bringing its total buybacks this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/business/shell-earnings-profit-oil-gas.html">to $18.5 billion</a>.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has made <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/15/saudi-arabia-gas-price-oil/">multiple</a><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/23/ukraine-russia-gas-prices-saudi-arabia-biden/">attempts</a> to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/11/mbs-saudi-oil-biden-october-surprise-election-interference/">convince Saudi Arabia</a>, the leader of the OPEC+ oil cartel, to increase its oil production — as reduced, and especially artificially reduced, supply is partially <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/opec-considers-cutting-oil-production-to-pump-up-prices">driving price hikes</a> — <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/11/mbs-saudi-oil-biden-october-surprise-election-interference/">to no avail</a>. Instead, the Saudis made production cuts so deep <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/20/saudi-oil-production-cut/">it even took Russia by surprise</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/19/biden-oil-companies-lower-gas-prices-00062554">pleaded with Big Oil</a> to decrease the price of gasoline, explicitly calling out their record profits. In an attempt to bring down costs, he also ordered the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/18/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-strengthen-u-s-energy-security-encourage-production-and-bring-down-costs/">release of 15 million barrels</a> from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but they will not be available until December.</p>
<p>“In the second quarter of this year, profits at six of the largest publicly traded oil companies were more than $70 billion. That’s $70 billion in just one quarter — 90 days,” Biden said <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/19/remarks-by-president-biden-on-actions-to-strengthen-energy-security-and-lower-costs/">during a press conference</a>. “So far, American oil companies are using that windfall — the windfall of profits to buy back their own stock, passing that money on to their shareholders, not to consumers.”<br><br>Exxon CEO Darren Wood mocked this sentiment ahead of his company’s earnings report.<br><br>“There has been discussion in the U.S. about our industry returning some of our profits directly to the American people,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-28/exxon-cites-dividend-in-response-to-biden-attack-on-oil-profits">said Woods</a>. “That’s exactly what we’re doing in the form of our quarterly dividend.”</p>
<p>The world’s seven largest oil companies, collectively, have reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/27/profits-at-worlds-seven-biggest-oil-firms-soar-to-almost-150bn-this-year-windfall-tax">more than $170 billion</a> in profits so far this year. The <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/">national average</a> price for a gallon of regular gasoline is around $3.76 — down from its <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/charts">summer peak</a> of over $5 per gallon, but still around 11 percent higher than <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/">this time last year</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, progressives in Congress <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-gas-prices-rise-warren-whitehouse-khanna-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-stop-big-oil-profiteering-and-provide-consumers-relief">introduced a bill</a> to implement a windfall profits tax, which would potentially rein in some of the excessive profiteering by Big Oil on the backs of working Americans. Despite polling showing <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/03/18/poll-shows-incredible-80-us-voters-support-windfall-tax-big-oil">a majority of Americans</a> support such a tax, the bill was met with <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-tax/2022/05/23/no-windfall-please-00034328">stiff opposition from Republicans</a> and has <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/s3802">stalled in Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Oil and gas PACs have already donated nearly $10 million to candidates this election cycle, with $7.8 million of that sum going to Republicans, according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/industry-detail/E01/2022">data from OpenSecrets</a>.</p>
