<p>We’ve written about <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this particular Camaro</a> – and this particular raffle – before. However, we think it’s important to <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">share it again</a>, because the raffle supports a very worthy cause, <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Ronald McDonald House Central Valley</a>.</p>

<p>You can buy one raffle ticket for $5, but the value – and the odds – get much better the more you donate. $100 gets you 100 tickets, and a $500 donation gets you 600! Best of all, if you <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">use the code WIN</a>, you get double your tickets for your money!</p>
<p>That means that a $500 donation would get you 1200 chances to win the car of your dreams. More importantly, though, you’ve done something great for charity and helped to make the world a better place. Only one person will <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">win the car</a>, but really, there are no losers here.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Camaro Pace Car</a> still has its original, numbers-matching 325 horsepower 396 big block V8, as well as its original TH400 automatic transmission. Like all 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1981-camaro-boost-train/">Camaro</a> Pace Cars, it wears a classy Dover White and Hugger Orange paint scheme with a matching orange houndstooth interior.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">‘69 Pace Car Camaro convertible</a> just isn’t your thing, that’s okay.
