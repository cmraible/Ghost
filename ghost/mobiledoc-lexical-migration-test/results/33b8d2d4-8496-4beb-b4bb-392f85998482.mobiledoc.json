As heavily altered as the exterior is, the inside is even more unique with a completely custom cabin from the dash to the seats. About the only thing not altered on this show car is the wrap-around windshield. Almost the entire inside of this Corvette is lined with high-quality and leather, and the door openings add tube braces for added safety. It's not clear if there's a soft top on this 'Vette, but the car does come with a removable hard top, which might be the only part of this car that hasn't been customized."

This engine cranks out 627 horsepower and 586 lb-ft of torque, and power is laid down through a four-speed automatic and an aftermarket nine-inch rear end. As you would expect from a show car, the attention to detail on the underside of this Corvette matches the rest of the build, and that five-link rear end with coilovers should allow this show car to handle as good as it looks."
