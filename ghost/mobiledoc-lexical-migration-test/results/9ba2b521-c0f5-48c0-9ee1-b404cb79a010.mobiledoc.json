The way he looks over at the cameraman after backing his burbling Chevy out of its parking spot just looks like something out of a ZZ Top video, only the cars in those were so much cooler."

Instead, what you get is to see how well he rolls down the road without his ride. Turning left, he nails it and the Camaro torque steers to the left a little too much. The driver overcorrects to the right, throwing him against the door which just pops open and the poor guy meets the pavement."

We have no idea if it crashed into something or came to rest harmlessly on some grass, but we hope for the latter. After all, it’s not the muscle car’s fault the owner apparently doesn’t know what a seatbelt is for."
