With all four wheels sticking upright in the air, he decided that he might as well make a truck that looked just like it without having to go through the expensive process of actually wrecking his vehicle. It was sort of a challenge to himself, if that makes sense. He wanted to see what his capabilities really were when it came to building a classic custom and this truck really does show off his talents well."

Needless to say the truck gets a lot of attention which is something that everybody close to this guy can enjoy. Many comments or comments pointed out what might happen if the truck was actually flipped over, pointing out paramedics might initially think it was completely fine due to its looks. While this is, of course, an absurd scenario, everything about this track is about having fun and thinking outside of the box which is why it is absolutely fantastic."
