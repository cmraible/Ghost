This feature made the standard 911 Carrera 3.2 look identical to the 930, and this particular "

Not only did the Turbo-look add the wide rear haunches and massive spoiler, it also upgraded the Carrera 3.2 to the suspension and brake setup from the 911 Turbo. All that's really missing from the M491 is the Turbo's 292 horsepower turbocharged flat-six, but the Carrera 3.2 still has plenty of pep with its 217-horsepower, 3.2-liter flat-six."

It has been properly stored since 1994, and to make it roadworthy, the 911 was recently serviced and given a brand new set of Pirelli tires. This Turbo-look 911 Carrera 3.2 is 100 percent original right down to the factory books and tool kit, and it will make a great addition to any classic car collection."
