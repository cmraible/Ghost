<p>As we continue to grapple with the devastation wrought by the current pandemic and come to terms with the fact that our fight with COVID is likely here to stay, it’s worth considering what comes next. In recent weeks, the term “endemicity” has emerged in the public sphere to describe how COVID will probably continue to circulate globally and undergo seasonal surges, like influenza and other respiratory viruses. As we highlight below in this edition of Weekend Reader, <em>Boston Review</em> recently published an article that highlights the shift the country must make from profit-driven medicine to people-centered primary care in order to prepare our communities for COVID’s long haul.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bostonreview.net/articles/how-medicine-must-change-for-endemic-covid-19/"><strong>How Medicine Must Change For Endemic COVID-19</strong></a> (Boston Review) — <em>“A great deal of public discussion in recent weeks has suggested that ‘endemicity’ — a state where the virus continues to circulate in the population like scores of other respiratory viruses, with more predictability albeit probably still with seasonal surges — is around the corner. The Europe office of the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, recently stated that the continent may be entering the ‘plausible endgame’ of the pandemic. But if long-term circulation is unavoidable, nihilism isn’t, and the number of lives lost annually to COVID-19 in the years to come depends in large part on actions we take today. As others have argued, there is an ongoing role for public health interventions to reduce transmission of the virus during surges, together with a need for massive investment in our nation’s underfunded public health infrastructure for a ‘New Deal for Public Health,’ as health law scholar Amy Kapczynski and epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves outlined in these pages nearly two years ago. Yet less has been said about improving our medical care response itself, particularly in the new era. There should be little doubt: Minimizing harm in an era of endemic COVID-19 requires us to reimagine key aspects of our medical system.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/cia-bulk-collection-data-stealing-wyden-snowden?r=1j871"><strong>The CIA Has Been Stealing Your Data For Years</strong></a> (Forever Wars) — <em>“On Thursday, two senators on the intelligence committee who have done significant work to expose and contextualize the War on Terror prompted a declassification that amounts to their own warning. Sens. Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich revealed that the CIA has ‘secretly conducted its own bulk [surveillance] program’ ensnaring Americans’ data. ‘Bulk’ refers to wholesale collection of data, rather than surveillance targeted at a person, account or enterprise due to suspicions relevant to a foreign-intelligence purpose.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/magazine/unions-amazon.html"><strong>Do Today’s Unions Have A Fighting Chance Against Corporate America?</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“The question is, can store-by-store campaigns ‘match the scale of corporate power in today’s American capitalism?’ a U.F.C.W. official, who wasn’t authorized by the union to speak on the record, told me. Every industry now seems to be dominated by monopolies and global chains. And the United States, unlike much of Asia and Europe, doesn’t have sector-wide bargaining where workers can organize across whole industries. ‘Walmart, Target, Starbucks — they have immense national and international resources,’ the official said. ‘The National Labor Relations Board isn’t built to help organize workers by the thousands, in many locations, all at once.’”</em></li>

Since that time, we've had therapists, teachers, lawyers, civil servants, social workers, and artists living </em><a href="https://www.insider.com/4-reasons-why-ive-spent-14-years-in-cohousing-and-why-i-plan-to-stay-2018-8"><em>in our co-op</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.insider.com/benefits-of-cohousing-for-single-moms-in-four-unit-building-2022-2"><em>We live together responsibly</em></a><em>. We cook meals, share chores, mow the lawn, and support one another through our successes and failures. We operate very much like a family. In fact, it's the only family our son has ever known. But as I stood in that dining room, happy faces staring back at me, I thought, ‘Can we still live this way when the baby comes, or will we have to leave?’”</em></li>
