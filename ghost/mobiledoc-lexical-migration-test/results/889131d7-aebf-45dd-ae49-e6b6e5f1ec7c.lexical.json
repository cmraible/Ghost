Powering this tiny road racing legend is a potent 2.7-liter built from the ground up to live up to RS MFI standards and now sits keenly within the engine bay of the sports car. This makes the car ready to tackle long straights with the vicious speed that you usually don't speed from classic German sports cars. All of that power is sent through a five-speed manual transaxle, allowing you to have the most engaging driving experience possible and pairs well with the WEVO shifter and MOMO steering wheel to create racing-focus energy.",
