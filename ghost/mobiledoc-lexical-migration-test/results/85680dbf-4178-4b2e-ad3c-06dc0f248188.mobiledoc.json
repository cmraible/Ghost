The thing you have to keep in mind is how horsepower was measured starting with the 1972 model year changed, so the ratings dipped. Also, with changes in government regulations, power from muscle cars dropped as pollution and fuel economy worries swept over the nation. You can argue with other enthusiasts about whether or not this means the ’72 Chevelle is a dog or not all day long, but some people still feel lucky enough to own these machines."
