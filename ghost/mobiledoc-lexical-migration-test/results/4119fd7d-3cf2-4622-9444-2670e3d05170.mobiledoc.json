One of the best features on this classic is the ZR1-style hood complete with a glass insert that allows everyone to peek at the small-block without lifting the hood. Even better, an under-dash switch hydraulically raises and lowers the hood without leaving the driver's seat, a feature not even the new Corvettes possess. A set of 17-inch wheels on all four corners are the perfect finishing touch to the exterior. The red matching interior is fitted with genuine Italian-grade leather bucket seats. This beauty also comes with a removable hardtop. With only 100 miles clocked since its restoration, this gem is guaranteed to bring home first-place awards at any car show. "
