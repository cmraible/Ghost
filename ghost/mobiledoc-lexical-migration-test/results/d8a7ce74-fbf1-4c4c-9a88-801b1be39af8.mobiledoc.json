The whole thing was caught on surveillance cameras with numerous cops around. Even the chief heard the tire roasting. To top it all off, there were people hanging out of the windows of a Dodge Charger leading the way, likely taking video to post on social media."

They chased down all three cars involved in the stunt, arresting all three drivers for reckless driving. Plus, all three vehicles were impounded, two of them were forfeited to police. We know property forfeitures are controversial, with some believing it to be some form of legal theft, so we expect enthusiasts to have mixed feelings about the response."

Maybe they looked the other way during the Summer of Love 2020, but that kind of tolerance or whatever you want to call it is out with the new police chief in place. We’re seeing similar toughening up of law enforcement in other cities where car theft, street takeovers, and other crimes have absolutely skyrocketed."
