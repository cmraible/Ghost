          "There’s no denying the average American is feeling the financial pressure mount. Thanks to a combination of inflation, economic woes brought about by shutdowns, and continual supply chain issues, the American dream is a fading reality for far too many. This certainly is true when it comes to affording a new or even a used car. Thankfully, iSeeCars has some solid data to back up what we’ve suspected about the lack of affordability in the auto market for some time."

As we know now, automakers cut production of new cars, then demand surged suddenly and shortages started compounding as supply chains struggled to fire up again."

Shockingly, right at the top of the list is the Toyota Avalon, something we don’t think anyone would’ve predicted. It saw a 37.6 percent drop in affordability thanks to its used price being $13,181 more than it was in August 2019. While the list is littered with fairly pedestrian commuter cars, a notable entrant is the Ford Mustang at number 4 with a 31.2 percent drop in affordability and a price increase of $11,984."

For some, that might mean the difference between a luxury and mainstream car or buying a Kia instead of a Buick."
