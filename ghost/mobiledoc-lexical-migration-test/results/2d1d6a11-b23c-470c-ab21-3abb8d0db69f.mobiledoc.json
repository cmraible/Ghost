On top of that, famous landmarks such as rivers and big bodies of water are named in the language spoken in that city, giving each stage flavour and an extra hint of uniqueness. Mini Motorways takes the player on a bite-sized trip throughout the world every time it is played."

Houses will often spawn on the opposite side of town from their specific destinations and it’s up to the player to connect the city. It’s a chaotic, often enraging and extremely satisfying puzzle to solve."

Although the game has no problems with lag or performance, the Switch hardware becomes noticeably hot while playing and the game drains battery life at a surprisingly fast rate, even when compared to other more complex games. Although far from a hardware killer, it is noticeable and perhaps an indication that the port might not be properly optimised."
