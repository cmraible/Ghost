It has a nice vintage looks on the outside, plenty of recent investments for utility, and you get to enjoy this full versatile V8 package from an upgraded interior. The color on this one makes a good first impression.  The fiery orange was an upgrade later in life, and it retains a nice gloss that highlights the extra curves that come on these stepside pickup beds. There are classic pieces like the bright chrome bumpers, and even a classic Thriftmaster badge on the side.  These are joined by nice upgrades like the newer wheels, tinted windows, and polished dual exhaust tips.  But the investments that you're going to like the best are the ones that add to the utility."
