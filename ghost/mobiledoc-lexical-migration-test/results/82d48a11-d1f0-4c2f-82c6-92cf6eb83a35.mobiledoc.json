With some financial help from the State of Ohio, Avanti production was moved from its birth spot in South Bend and relocated to Youngstown, Ohio. For 1988 and 1989, two-door coupes and a convertible were produced, and the '88 model was called the \"Silver Year\" as it marked the 25th anniversary of the namesake. In 1989, Cafaro decided to build a four-door sedan after losing confidence in the two-door coupe. The public was disinterested and only 90 sedans were made total. Soon after, the Youngstown plant closed its doors in 1991 after four years and 405 cars produced. "
