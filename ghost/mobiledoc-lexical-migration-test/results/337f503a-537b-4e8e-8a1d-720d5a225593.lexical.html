It’s the first day Washington has seen a coherent, organized coalition in Congress wielding power from the left. And it has the congressional leadership confused.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/world/australia/daintree-rainforest-indigenous.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes"><strong>Australia’s Daintree Forest Returned to Indigenous Peoples</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“The Daintree Rainforest in Australia — a world-famous travel destination and, at an estimated 180 million years old, one of the world’s oldest forests — was one of four national parks returned to their traditional owners on Wednesday under an agreement signed with the Queensland state government. Nearly 400,000 acres of land in northeast Australia, consisting of dense forests, sprawling mountain ranges and white sand beaches, was handed back to the Eastern Kuku Yalanji Aboriginal people, believed to have lived in the area for more than 50,000 years.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article254643767.html"><strong>Civil Rights Attorney and Constitutional Law Professor Nominated to Federal Judgeship</strong></a> (McClatchy) — <em>“[Dale] Ho was a lead attorney in the 2018 challenge to the [voter registration] law, which required Kansans to produce proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote.<strong></strong>The statute placed tens of thousands of residents in suspended registration status and threatened their ability to vote in the 2014 and 2016 elections… Ho also successfully prevented the 2020 U.S. Census from asking people whether they are a U.S. citizen, a provision [Kris] Kobach says he pitched to former President Donald Trump.” (Editor’s note: Ho was also </em>Daily Poster reporter <em>Walker Bragman’s professor!)</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/cfpb-rohit-chopra-confirmed.html"><strong>Watchdog Confirmed As Consumer Bureau Chief</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“As President Biden’s choice for director, Mr. Chopra will be returning to an agency he helped build. Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a decade ago with a simple mission: to regulate financial companies and protect consumers. The brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who lists it in her Twitter bio as one of her children alongside her two human offspring, it set out to crack down on the kinds of abuses that led to the 2008 mortgage crisis and subsequent economic crash. The bureau quickly became one of Washington’s most feared and aggressive regulators.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

Having said this much, it’s my duty to give a further update: in an email, NPR CEO John Lansing says that as of January 1, the union-negotiated 20 weeks of parental leave will also apply to non-union staff.”</em></p>
