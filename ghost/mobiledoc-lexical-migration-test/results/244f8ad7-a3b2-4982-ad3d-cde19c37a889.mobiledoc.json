After learning of a street takeover, deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office responded, observing a Mustang turning some smokey donuts in an intersection. That’s when they tried pulling the little pony over, but the driver decided running for it was a better idea."

These sorts of stunts are how suspects end up with a K9 after them, so if he didn’t get such treatment the guy should consider himself lucky."
