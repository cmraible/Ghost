<p>Like the leaping cat up front, this will growl menacingly up an empty street, while those front headlamps look just as sinister as the eyes on the tripod martian machines from <em>War of the Worlds</em>. Getting a parking space at Walmart – through sheer intimidation – has never been so easy!</p>
<p>When you’re done, enjoy a 0-60mph of 6.6 seconds and a top speed of up to 146mph. Proof if ever that you can be living it all while you’re giving it all.</p>
