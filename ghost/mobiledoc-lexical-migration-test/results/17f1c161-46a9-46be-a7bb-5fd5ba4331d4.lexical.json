The ad is supposed to get you excited for the 2022 Toyota GR86, what you might have known before as simply the Toyota 86 or the Scion FR-S. However, the commercial exposes one of the many things wrong with modern automakers, whether that was part of the point or not. It’s actually rather genius and something I watched multiple times while sending to other people so they could enjoy a good laugh.",

Those are the reasons people buy performance vehicles, which is why it’s so hilarious when automakers try to portray rather pedestrian, boring vehicles like the Hyundai Elantra in that light.",

This is in part why it seems like automakers are all doing pretty much the same thing, even though most people aren’t asking for it. Sure, the companies say they’re just meeting market demand, but what’s really going on is automakers don’t really, truly have to care what you want if they all act in lockstep. After all, the auto industry has become an oligopoly in the past few decades. Less competition means consumers are pretty much forced to consume whatever the limited producers put in front of them.",
