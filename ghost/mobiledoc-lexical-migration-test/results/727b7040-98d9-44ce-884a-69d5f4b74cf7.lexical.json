It's called the Siber Truck, and it is quite a stunning creature.

In addition, a set of massive ground-pounding mud tires wrap a collection of tiny wheels(because who needs brakes?) to show off the spectacular offroad performance that this machine holds.",

One area in which it is totally superior to its Cyber Truck competitor is that this thing's windows won't break if you through a metal ball at it.
