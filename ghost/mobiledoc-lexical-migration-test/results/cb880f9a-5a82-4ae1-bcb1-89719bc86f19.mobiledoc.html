<p>Plenty of guys have intimidating-looking Camaros, which really isn’t difficult to accomplish thanks to the aggressive looks of the current and previous generation. But this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/168122/2010-chevrolet-camaro-h035-edition">2010 Chevrolet Camaro HO35 Edition</a> takes an SS and literally blows it to new heights, backing up those cool and antagonistic looks.</p>

<p>First, the main attraction to this Camaro is the supercharged LS3 V8. This isn’t even your run-of-the-mill blown LS3 because it was both built and dyno-tuned by Hendrick Performance. Maximum output now measures a whopping 500 horsepower, so you’ll blow the doors off the competition and they will most likely be shocked. A performance exhaust system and Hurst short throw shifter round out a solid build.</p>

<p>With a powertrain like that, you don’t really need to make much more of a statement. But the exterior of this Camaro is aggressive while being strategically restrained, avoiding some of the over-the-top excesses you get with certain builds. Forged aluminum wheels, a tail splitter rear spoiler, Hendrick Performance carbon fiber rear valance, and snake splitter front fascia add a nice edge. HID headlights light up the night and top off those amazing aesthetics.</p>
<p>Just because this is a performance machine doesn’t mean it’s stripped down inside. Black leather upholstery, power moonroof with express open, front seat heaters, OnStar, a Boston Acoustic 9-speaker sound system, satellite radio, Bluetooth, and other factory features make for a really nice experience. There’s also a supplemental gauge package in the center console so you can keep your eye on vitals when pushing this Chevy to the limit.</p>
<p>This particular 2010 Chevrolet SS HO35 commemorates the launch of the brand 75 years earlier. This one is #35 and the plaque mounted to the dash is signed by Rick Hendrick, making it that much more desirable for Chevy fans and collectors.
