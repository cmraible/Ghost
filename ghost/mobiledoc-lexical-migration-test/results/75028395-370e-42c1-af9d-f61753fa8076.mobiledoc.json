          "Disabled members of our society have it rough even in today’s world of high tech and ease of access. Depending on their situations, disabilities can range from not being able to walk to mental disability or even not being able to move at all. The latter predicament is particularly challenging as it can leave someone trapped indefinitely without the ability to do anything for themselves. One company has decided to take matters into its own hands in a move that will surely be remembered as the first step towards a brighter future. Here’s the story of how one man could finally drive despite his disability which leaves him unable to use his arms or legs. "

          "The vehicle in question is a significantly modified C8 Corvette built for two distinct reasons. First, going fast is a primary objective for the car, but more importantly, the vehicle can react to slight head movements and breathing to control its various functions. A set of motion-detecting cameras notice every head activity from this quadriplegic driver. These cameras control the car’s steering, which would be crazy enough, but the throttle and brake controls are even wilder. Using pressure sensors and a specially designed draw for the driver, the gas and brake on this car are controlled through the car-loving racer’s breathing."

          "Sucking in to stop the car and blowing out to push the gas, this man has been given a new chance to follow a passion most would have considered lost for him. While the application of this technology in racing is exciting, the team of engineers hopes to expand its use to other fields of service. Perhaps this will help get otherwise poverty-bound disabled folks back to work in the operation of vehicles like trucks and forklifts. Whatever happens now, at least one quadriplegic man can finally get behind the wheel of one of the modern world’s newest sports cars and was excited to see how the story unfolds for this game-changing design."
