Understandably, the owner of the collection, who is a widow, doesn’t want the location disclosed since there are people who would just head out there to harass her. What’s great is this collection is for sale, so the video we’ve included isn’t just for your viewing pleasure. You could score a really nice classic American car, if you move quickly."

Another is a 1958 Edsel Pacer, something which many have declared to be the worst car ever made, but lately is being appreciated more. A Kaiser the guy in the video doesn’t seem to know much about seems to need a lot of work is also available. It might make for a good parts vehicle or a restomod build."
