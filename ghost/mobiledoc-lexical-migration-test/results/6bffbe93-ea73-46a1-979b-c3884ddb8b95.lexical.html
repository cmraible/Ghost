</div> I’m back in the office today, after a week working remotely.<p></p>
<p>Much as I enjoy working from home, or other locations, I am glad to be back in <em>EG</em>‘s Procter Street hub. Working from home is an excellent way of concentrating on particualr tasks, getting copy edited and sent to the sub-editing desks and clearing e-mail.</p>
<p>But the social buzz of the office is still the best way of generating ideas. If we do, as a culture, shift towards a more mobile working paradigim, then our office spaces are going to have to develop to reflect their primarily social role.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
