Although one extremely rare Mopar just couldn’t get there.</h3>
<hr>
<p> Earlier this month we reported this extremely rare <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1971-hemi-cuda-convertible/">1970 Plymouth ‘Cuda</a> was heading to Mecum’s Indy 2021 Auction. As possibly one of the rarest of the old Mopars, this car was expected to sell for record $6.5-million and it carried a reserve of $5.75-million. Unfortunately though, neither of those figures were reached during the auction and bidding topped out at $4.8-million. While it is immediately not clear as to why this car was a no-sale, it is clear that it was not about the car itself because this is probably the nicest example of one of the rarest muscle cars ever made. Additionally, its options list and history effectively make it a one-of-one car. </p>

<p>In case you forgot, In 1971 Plymouth only made 12 HEMI ‘Cuda Convertibles and only three of them came equipped with the A833 4-speed transmission. One of those cars wore a Winchester Gray finish and was exported to France. In 1993, the car showed up in a for sale ad and was repatriated to the U.S. As of now the 1971 Plymouth ‘Cuda Convertible currently shows the equivalent of just over 61k-miles on the clock and is in as original of condition as any classic Mopar as we have ever seen. </p>

<p>This car went to Mecum’s Indy 2021 auction as a part of their “Class Of ‘71” collection. The collection featured four examples of some of Mopar’s finest muscle cars. Of the collection, only one actually sold, a Bright Blue 1971 Dodge HEMI Challenger for $352k. While we are disappointed that the Winchester Gray 1971 Plymouth <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/nash-bridges-plymouth-hemi-cuda/">HEMI ‘Cuda Convertible</a> didn’t meet its highly anticipated goal, we are sure we will see this car pop up again at another upcoming auction. That is, if the owner hasn’t decided to hang on to it instead. Who knows maybe it'll skip right over its current expected sales record and break the next one ten years from now.</p>
