Mated up to it is a four-speed manual Muncie transmission which was overhauled in 2018. To ensure this car is mechanically sound, the seller states one of the shocks, a brake caliper, and the brake fluid were all recently replaced. In other words, this sounds like a true turn-key investment you can begin enjoying from day one."
