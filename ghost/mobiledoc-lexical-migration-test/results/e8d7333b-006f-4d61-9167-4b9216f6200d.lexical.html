<h3 id="fords-farewell-to-the-fox-body-was-a-limited-production-cobra">Ford's farewell to the Fox body was a limited-production Cobra.</h3>
<p>As Ford was preparing to launch the fourth-generation Mustang for the 1994 model year, the automaker had one more trick up its sleeve to give the Fox Body a proper sendoff: the <a href="https://tommackclassics.com/357-1993-ford-mustang-cobra/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious%20UTM for HANDPICKED ONLY">1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra</a>. Excluding the rare Cobra R model, only 4,993 of these SVT Cobras were built, and this one – no. 4,048 – will be auctioned off next month through <a href="https://tommackclassics.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious%20UTM for HANDPICKED ONLY">Tom Mack Auctions</a>.</p>

<p>With just 7,800 miles on the odometer, this SVT Cobra looks as new as it did when it rolled off the Dearborn Assembly Plant line on June 4, 1993. This information is known because the car comes with a certificate of authenticity from Ford as well as the Monroney sticker showing its original MSRP of $20,246. Looking at current prices of these '93 Cobras, you're probably going to need a much larger amount of money to get the winning bid on this car.</p>
<p>The 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra was the first vehicle developed under Ford's new Special Vehicle Team (SVT), and this group has gone onto create high-performance Ford products like the Ford Lightning, Shelby GT500, Ford F-150 SVT Raptor and more. The SVT Cobra started with the Mustang GT Coupe (no convertible Cobras in 1993), and the 5.0-liter V8 received GT-40 heads from Ford Racing, upgraded intake manifold and camshaft and a performance exhaust helping boost the Cobra's power output to 235 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque – the 1993 Mustang GT was rated at 205 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque.</p>

<p>While the horsepower gains weren't huge, the key improvements made to the SVT Cobra were to the brakes and suspension. The Cobra has larger vented disc brakes (10.84 inches front and 10.07 inches rear) than the Mustang GT, and the front struts were modified for improved cornering. In total, the Mustang SVT Cobra was able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds.</p>
<p>Subtle enhancements were made to the overall styling of the SVT Cobra including a redesigned front fascia with round fog lights, unique 17-inch wheels, special Cobra badges, a bigger rear wing and pinstriped taillights (from the Mustang SVO). This was the hottest Fox Body Mustang ever made, and now's your chance to add this rare, souped-up Mustang to your collection.</p>
