In fact, it reportedly took 3 days for the status of the car to be switched to stolen. When a local reporter reached out to the mayor of Harvey, Christopher Clark, it was revealed the problem had been with a police dispatcher no inputting information about the car theft into the system. Thanks to what Clark described as ongoing problems with the dispatch system, the mayor asked for Cook County Sheriff’s Department to run dispatch for the city, which it has."
