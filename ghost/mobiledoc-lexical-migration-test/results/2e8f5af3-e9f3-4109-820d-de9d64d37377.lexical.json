Z0Sick6 said he told his friend to call the owner of the dealership as well as “Chevy corporate” and tell them exactly what happened. That’s completely appropriate and we would do the same, at minimum. Actually, we would’ve called the dealership service department and left a message letting them know we took our car back because they couldn’t follow simple directions, so we don’t get why this guy played the silent game.
