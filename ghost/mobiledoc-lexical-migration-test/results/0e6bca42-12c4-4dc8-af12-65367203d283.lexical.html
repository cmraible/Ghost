<p>By subscribing to <em>The Lever</em>, you’re making a choice to cut through corporate media’s simplistic narratives about the world that just don’t square with the nuance and facts on the ground.

<p>This week, <em>The Lever</em> team’s reporting pressured the <em>Washington Post </em>to issue a correction to an irresponsible<em></em>“Fact Check” column written by Glenn Kessler that called into question the case of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was unable to access abortion care in her home state. On <em>Lever Time, </em>we grilled Obama Council of Economic Advisers chairman Jason Furman on his role in propagating inflation misinformation. Sirota reported on how Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) made the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) substantially worse by exempting many private equity firms from additional taxation — despite Democrats pledging to hold the line against any<em></em>amendments to the IRA. We also pointed out that since Biden’s inauguration, any discussion of a public health insurance option is verboten.</p><!--members-only-->
