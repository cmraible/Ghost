While it doesn’t pay back what they’ve done, it’s always nice to see businesses honoring what the men and women in uniform do for society by giving them discounts or even free services. That’s exactly what the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky is doing as Memorial Day approaches."

Go spend some time at a local cemetery to see some touching tributes to those who have died on battlefields protecting this county."

All kinds of ‘Vettes are on display, including many rare models. There’s even an Aliens-inspired concept model created by Tom Peters after he saw the movie in theaters back in the 80s. There are also interactive displays so you can learn more about the history of his long-running Chevrolet product, plus there’s a great kids’ area so the little ones can enjoy the experience."
