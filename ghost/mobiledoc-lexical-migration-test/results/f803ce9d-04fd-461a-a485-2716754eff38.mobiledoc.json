While the barn find car was in poor condition and needed quite the restoration, the fact it was exceedingly rare and of course exceptionally valuable made the effort more than worth it. What’s strange about the find was that a German television crew was responsible for it."

This habit of stashing potentially valuable old stuff is also a thing in Germany, a place known for its tidiness. As they sifted through the items, two vintage Porsche 911s were uncovered. One of those, chassis number 300.057, was actually a fabled Porsche 901."

That immediately raised the hackles of Peugeot, which felt it had the legal rights for all cars with a three-digit number with the middle digit being a zero. That might sound ridiculous, but the French automaker was able to defend that claim, so Porsche was forced to change the name of the 901 to the 911."

A mere 82 Porsche 901s were made, although you wouldn’t know what they are simply by glancing at them. These cars were all badged as Porsche 911s, but a close examination of the chassis and build numbers reveal they were designated as 901s in the factory before Porsche was forced to make the switch."

Pretty much the only remnants of the interior were the dash and steering wheel. The engine was also seized. However, since the car had just sat and hadn’t been restored in any way, Porsche was able to do an extremely correct restoration. It was a painstaking process which lasted three years."
