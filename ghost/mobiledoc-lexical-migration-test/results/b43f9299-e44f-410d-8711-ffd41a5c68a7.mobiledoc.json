The ad appeared to violate The Daily’s policy against fossil fuel sponsorships, which the Times itself revealed earlier this year.”"

            "“What’s happening on beaches in the Hamptons and nearby is no last-minute maneuver. The spending is merely the latest turn in an eight-decade drama between humans and nature — storm destruction and restoration, lobbying and lawsuits — that’s creating one of the most ambitious running battles against climate change in U.S. history. Of all places, it’s the Hamptons and nearby beaches that will be the biggest test bed for the elaborate policies and defensive measures needed in vulnerable beach communities around the world, even those that aren’t home to millionaires and billionaires. That makes the Hamptons both a climate laboratory and the face of an existential question: How long can, and should, governments deploy a mountain of cash against the implacable rise of warming seas?”"

But Harmony is at the center of the Familiar Faces project, an official list of people with severe and persistent illnesses whom Fulton County, where Atlanta is located, and the state desperately want to get off the street and out of the county jail. I would argue that no one currently experiencing homelessness in Fulton County, if not the state, requires more help than Harmony.”"

            "Within a few weeks of Savile’s death, MacKean had collected on-the-record testimony from 10 women who had been at Duncroft. Seven had been abused and three had witnessed abuse by Savile. It had been difficult to convince them to go public. Some told her they worried they would be seen as complicit; they were sure they wouldn’t be believed. Some feared a backlash, that people would claim they were out for something: compensation, notoriety. MacKean, a BBC journalist of 20 years’ standing, assured the women that they’d have the weight of Newsnight behind them, and the support of the BBC. But a few days before the transmission date, the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, told MacKean and Jones that the piece couldn’t be broadcast.”"
