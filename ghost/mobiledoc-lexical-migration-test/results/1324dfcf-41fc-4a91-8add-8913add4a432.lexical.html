<p>Bob and Angie Shepherd recently had their car stolen, which sucks, obviously. But the situation got even worse when the traffic tickets started to pile up. Their stolen car was used in a crime spree, and they’re having to sort this one out in order to fight back.</p>
<p>“So I get up in the morning and I’m going to work,” Bob Shepherd said. “Her car is not there.”</p>

<p>“The PTSD I’m suffering from because every time someone knocks on my door, I’m worried it’s them coming back,” Angie Shepherd said.</p>
<p>The Shepards were understandably shook up by the crime, but it’s what would come next that they really didn’t expect: Their car was used in a homicide in a nearby city.</p>
<p>“We saw the video of them getting out of her vehicle, shooting the other guy, getting back in the car and driving off,” Bob Shepherd said.</p>

<p>After the murder, the criminals proceeded to race up more than $400 in traffic citations, issued in the District of Columbia. You’d think the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles would automatically understand the situation once the car was reported stolen, but they’re still stuck with the bill, and haven’t heard back from the department since.</p>
<p>“Car is stolen, involved in a homicide, and then you want to charge me for the tickets, even though I’ve given you all of the documentation showing that it’s been involved in a homicide,” Bob Shepherd said.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is not uncommon for the department. Several people have had to battle with D.C. over traffic fines they weren’t responsible for paying. A 74- year-old Vietnam veteran had to pay $2000 in traffic fines after his vehicle was stolen.</p>
