It’s always good to be skeptical of anonymous sources for several reasons, so don’t think this means for sure GM was even considering such a move or that it’s entirely off the table. In other words, if you want to see such a 6th gen Z/28 become reality, getting all your buddies together to harass GM about it could help make it a reality. After all, there are instances of enthusiasts pressuring automakers to change decisions which were supposedly already set in stone."
