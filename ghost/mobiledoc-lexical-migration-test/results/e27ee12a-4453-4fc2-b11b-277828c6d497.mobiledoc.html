<p>Bitcoin and other decentralized digital forms of money, together known as cryptocurrencies, are currently the talk of the town. The total value of Bitcoin, the most recognizable and valuable cryptocurrency, is now over $1 trillion, and major Wall Street banks have been heavily investing in the market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thanks to crypto’s <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/08/cryptocurrency-industry-spending-big-against-senates-infrastructure-bill/">growing</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29f32905-1933-458e-aa29-7f1685109ea1">powerful</a><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/15/crypto-campaign-donations/">presence</a> in Washington, politicians ranging from current New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) to former Democratic President Bill Clinton to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) are championing crypto as a growth industry. Even longtime investigative journalists like Glenn Greenwald have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/andrew-yang-glenn-greenwald-share-philosophy-on-bitcoin">endorsed</a> virtual currencies, celebrating how they can offer enhanced financial privacy.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies come with an ugly cost: enormous fossil fuel consumption for a highly speculative product that has worsened inequality by generating a growing number of crypto-billionaires. This week’s Cheat Sheet focuses on crypto — what it is, what it does to the world, and how communities are responding to the crypto-takeover.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="what-is-crypto">What Is Crypto?</h3>
<p>A cryptocurrency is a digital code-based unit of money. Crypto ownership records are stored on a decentralized, securely linked digital ledger often called a blockchain.</p>
<p>Defining crypto more broadly is a complex matter. It’s definitely not an actual currency, because it is very rarely used as legal tender to buy or sell items —it’s highly likely that <a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/how-ramen-noodles-beat-cigarettes-to-become-a-prison-currency/">ramen noodles</a> are currently used by more people to regularly barter for daily goods and services. Crypto is also not a security, because it’s not attached to any underlying asset like stocks or bonds. Crypto may be most similar to gold or other commodities, because of its finite nature and the resources, time, and labor that it takes to “mine” it — but cryptos’ values can shift far more rapidly. In just the past year, there have been two Bitcoin <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+to+usd&ei=l1x1YtjbMZWjqtsP0vewkAY&ved=0ahUKEwiYg-7gtMv3AhWVkWoFHdI7DGIQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=bitcoin+to+usd&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCggAEJECEEYQggIyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BwgAEEcQsAM6BwgAELADEEM6CggAEOQCELADGAE6EgguEMcBENEDEMgDELADEEMYAjoMCC4QyAMQsAMQQxgCOgoIABCxAxCDARAKOgcIABCxAxAKOgQIABAKOgQIABBDOgsIABCABBCxAxCDAToICAAQgAQQsQM6BQgAEJECSgUIPBIBNEoECEEYAEoECEYYAVC2EVipGGD1GGgEcAF4AIABoQGIAbUHkgEDMC43mAEAoAEByAERwAEB2gEGCAEQARgJ2gEGCAIQARgI&sclient=gws-wiz">crashes</a> in which the cryptocurrency lost half of its value.</p>
<h3 id="crypto%E2%80%99s-promised-potential">Crypto’s Promised Potential</h3>
<p>Advocates of crypto say it is a boon to personal privacy. After all, because of the anonymous nature of the blockchain, it’s far easier to move digital money around without surveillance than it is in say, the U.S. banking system, which is tightly monitored, thanks to the USA PATRIOT Act. Crypto fans also say the decentralized nature of the currencies allows for greater wealth distribution. As billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/01/tim-draper-on-bitcoin-and-the-collapse-of-fiat/">put it</a>, “The fact that [Bitcoin] is so frictionless means that the entire world will become wealthier because, as we all know, the more friction in our currency, the less wealth in a society.”</p>
<p>But a brief history of crypto shows that these supposed benefits also have their downsides. The anonymous and decentralized nature of Bitcoin, which was founded in 2008 by an unknown individual using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamato, made it the currency of choice for the Silk Road online black market, which created a platform for the sale of <a href="https://books.google.com.ni/books?id=31vMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=silk+road+child+pornography&source=bl&ots=XaMq1lM__9&sig=ACfU3U1ZT_BraNmfNha7eiw8MYai9XtGxw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3goe6tsv3AhXgmmoFHQqOCRIQ6AF6BAgQEAM#v=onepage&q=silk%20road%20child%20pornography&f=false">child pornography</a> and other illicit items until the marketplace was shut down in 2013.</p>
<h3 id="crypto%E2%80%99s-environmental-impact">Crypto’s Environmental Impact</h3>
<p>Due to the need for electricity-intensive computing resources needed to develop lines of code for each coin, the annual carbon impact of mining Bitcoin alone is currently equivalent to the total yearly emissions of major countries like <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/environment/as-cryptocurrency-becomes-mainstream-its-carbon-footprint-can-t-be-ignored-81118">New Zealand</a> and Finland. The problem is going to get worse: Because each bitcoin needs to be unique, as more bitcoins are produced the underlying code becomes more complex, causing crypto mining to become <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-mining-electricity-usage-more-than-google-2021-9#:~:text=Bitcoin%20mining%20consumes%20around%2091,from%20just%20five%20years%20ago.">more</a> energy intensive over time.</p>
<p>When China <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/04/crypto-banned-china-other-countries/#:~:text=When%20it%20banned%20crypto%20last%20year%2C%20China%20did%20so%20in,outlawed%20cryptocurrencies%20outright%20in%20September.">banned</a> crypto transactions and mining in 2021 because they were obstructing their ability to meet climate goals, it resulted in an enormous flood of investment into bitcoin mining elsewhere, including in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58896545">United States</a>.</p>
<p>In upstate New York, bitcoin mining has caused such exorbitant electricity usage and excessive noise from the servers, that in 2017, the city of Plattsburgh <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">issued</a> a moratorium on new bitcoin mining until officials were able to put in place new regulations. More recently, on <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-york-assembly-passes-anti-mining-7852782/#:~:text=On%20April%2026%2C%202022%2C%20the,transactions%20(e.g.%2C%20Bitcoin).">April 26</a>, the New York State Assembly passed legislation issuing a moratorium on all new crypto mining powered by fossil fuel sources.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-and-wealth-inequality">Crypto And Wealth Inequality</h3>
<p>While many predicted crypto would reduce wealth inequality, the opposite has occurred: As these currencies have skyrocketed in value thanks to Wall Street-backed speculation and media hype, most of the windfall has gone to a handful of powerful owners. For example, one tenth of one percent of all Bitcoin holders <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-wealth-one-percent/">control</a> more than a quarter of the currency’s total assets.</p>
<p>Many people, meanwhile, are finding themselves marginalized in the crypto rush. A generous tax regime in Puerto Rico, for example, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/us/puerto-rico-gentrification.html">resulted</a> in significant displacement of ordinary Puerto Ricans as crypto billionaires and millionaires rush in to buy property, driving up the cost of living.</p>
<p>Growing concerns about crypto inequality are beginning to trigger public backlash. Revelations that former child actor and current Bitcoin billionaire Brock Pierce (who was <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/strange-saga-jeffrey-epstein-s-link-brock-pierce-1240462/">arrested</a> by Interpol in 2002 following allegations of underage sexual abuse) ferried Mayor Adams to Puerto Rico on his private jet <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/mayor-elect-eric-adams-flew-to-puerto-rico-on-bitcoin-billionaires-private-jet/3417754/">led to protests</a> in New York City.</p>
<h3 id="a-digital-pyramid-scheme">A Digital Pyramid Scheme?</h3>
<p>Crypto is inherently speculative, because it is not connected to an asset and it has no inherent use. That means investing in such currencies can come with considerable risks. In 2014, the collapse of the largest bitcoin exchange, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">Mt. Gox</a>, led to 850,000 bitcoins being lost — nearly 10 percent of the total bitcoin supply at the time. Less than a quarter of those coins were ultimately recovered. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe">May 2018</a>, the Justice Department announced an investigation into bitcoin price manipulation, but since then, there have been no public developments on the matter.</p>
<p>Despite crypto’s enormously speculative nature, retirement funds are starting to heavily invest in the space. Fidelity has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/business/crypto-401k-fidelity.html?smid=tw-nytimesbusiness&smtyp=cur">pledged</a> to allow its 401(k) participants to invest their retirement in bitcoin, despite a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/business/the-labor-department-wants-to-investigate-crypto-in-retirement-plans.html">guidance</a> from the Department of Labor urging against it. The Houston Firefighters pension fund has also begun an aggressive foray into crypto, investing <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1v8fcl8styx0y/A-Public-Pension-Fund-Tests-the-Cryptocurrency-Waters">$25 million</a> into bitcoin and another cryptocurrency called Ethereum.</p>
<p>The presence of crypto in retirement plans has so alarmed the Labor Department that in March they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/business/the-labor-department-wants-to-investigate-crypto-in-retirement-plans.html">pledged</a> to investigate plans that include cryptocurrency in their offerings.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-be-done">What Can Be Done?</h3>
<p>While officials have begun discussing increasing regulation and oversight of cryptocurrencies, one of the most effective approaches would be scrutiny from the Environmental Protection Agency. Congressional Democrats have been pressuring the agency to <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-mining-stocks-epa-regulation-51651610725">examine</a> the ecological impact of crypto mining.</p>
<p>Others are calling for the development of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-big-money-battle-over-cryptos-public-option/">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC), a kind of public option for cryptocurrencies, which could be more stable and viable than highly volatile cryptocurrencies, and that wouldn’t require such energy-intensive proof-of-work systems — but some critics say a CBDC wouldn’t help much.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Puerto Rico’s current status as a bitcoin haven underscores the critical need to draw attention to the powerful mainland billionaires seeking to implement their vision on the island.</p>
