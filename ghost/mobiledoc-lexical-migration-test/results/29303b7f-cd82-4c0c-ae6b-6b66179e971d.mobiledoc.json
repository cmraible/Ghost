          "According to the Ontario Provincial Police, a 14-year-old was caught driving 200 kph in an 80 kph zone in Lakeshore. For our American readers, that’s about 124 mph in a 50 mph zone, so he was hauling. Even more importantly it was a kid who’s definitely not old enough to drive behind the wheel. Kids joyriding in cars they shouldn’t be driving is nothing new, but it’s more shocking when they get their hands on something a little more performance-oriented."

We do know there were two 13-year-old passengers in the car. Going out on a limb, we’re guessing the driver was either trying to impress a girl he likes or was being encouraged to drive like a bat out of hell by his friends."

We can only imagine what the parents of the three kids had to say. They should be facing some stiff consequences to make the teens think, considering they seem to think taking a car on a high-speed jaunt is totally fine."
