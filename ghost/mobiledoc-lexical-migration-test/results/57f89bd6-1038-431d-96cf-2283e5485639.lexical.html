<p>Welcome to part 4 of our walkthrough of the Pikuniku Adventure Mode! Whilst this game is quite linear, there are still some moments and puzzles that may leave you scratching your head. Now that we’ve restored power to the hideout, let’s go to the lake.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Main Objective: Go to the lake</h3>

<p>Head out of the hideout and catch the train to The lake…</p>

<p>Now that you’re at The lake, proceed to the far right and you’ll start talking to a worm. He’ll tell you that he had a key to the cabin that we had walked past… but he lost it along the way. So for some reason, it’s up to us to find it. So we’re going to be playing a little game call <em>Pik Dug</em>!</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Find the cabin key</h3>
<p>We explored every nook and cranny here, and it turns out that the key is just near the bottom. So head all the way down and here it is…</p>

<p>Now that we have the key, head back to the cabin and go inside.</p>

<p>In the cabin, stand on the lift platform and kick the switch to go down.</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Follow the worm</h3>

<p>Now that we’re underground, walk to the right and rocks will fall, trapping you inside. Make your way up to here and kick the wall.</p>

<p>Flick the switch and jump through the top-left zigzag opening to get back. Now you can proceed to the right. Jump on the button on the detonator to activate the bomb and destroy the wall. Keep moving right and use the grappling ring on the ceiling in order to get yourself on the upper ledge.</p>

<p>Continue around and down to a room with some buttons and barrels. First, you’ll want to get the barrel down from the platform above and manoeuvre it onto the button on the left.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4767" src="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?resize=900%2C506" alt="Pikuniku Walkthrough Lake" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?w=2880&ssl=1 2880w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?resize=2000%2C1125&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?resize=1300%2C731&ssl=1 1300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?w=1800&ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-15-at-1.49.50-pm.png?w=2700&ssl=1 2700w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This will open the door in the bottom-right. Head over there and stand on the button so that the barrel will fall from the middle. Kick that barrel from the right to the left up the hill (but don’t let it roll over). When you kick it, jump up-right. Now head onto the platform on the right and the barrel will roll onto the button and will lift you up.</p>

<p>When you make your way over, kick the button to the left so that the box with the spring button will be brought up.</p>

<p>Push the box over to the right and into the hole. Kick the button on the right and the box will be lifted up again. Jump over the box so that you are on the left side of it and push it further to the right. Once you’ve done that, jump on the box and <em>boing</em> upwards.</p>
<p>In this next room, head over to the right and use the mushroom to springboard up onto a floating platform. Make your way left and you’ll interact with the worm. Walk past the spring on the ceiling that is there because it wants to be and jump onto the detonator at the end of the tunnel in order to continue.</p>

<p>Jump down onto the elevator and the worm will press the button for you to go down. In this next room, we’re going to need the detonator for the bomb. Head to the left and go through the pipe 80s Italian plumber style.</p>

<p>Manoeuvre the barrel onto a conveyor platform and the spring button in the top-right can push it to the left and it can fall through the entrance you came through.

<p>Get the barrel down to the bottom and onto the button.</p>

<p>In this room, there is a left button and a right button that you can turn on and off. Do so in this order (make sure to wait until Ernie has landed and is stable before pressing each button): Right on, left on, right off, right on, left off, right off, left on, right on.</p>
<p>With that, Ernie, will be pressing down the bottom button and will open the door to your right for you to jump out.</p>

<p>Now jump down to meet Ernie and kick the button on the right to lift both of you up. Once you’re up, kick Ernie to the left and put him in the crevice below the rotating +. Head up-left and jump into the +, jumping out towards the button that you need to stand on. When you do, Ernie will be lifted and the + will eventually bring him up the slope.</p>

<p>Now that he’s up, keep pushing him further to the left, all the way so that he is on the wooden lift. Head up to the area that’s shown in the picture below and kick the button that will bring Ernie up.</p>

<p>When the lift is all the way up, jump on Ernie and then onto the platform above so that you can flick the switch. With this door open, Ernie will be reunited with his worm family.</p>
<p>After some dialogue and talking to the rebels, it’ll be time for…</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Beat the giant robot of the lake</h3>

<p>Now that that’s done, use the mine cart to get back to the start. Take the lift up, exit the cabin and make your way right towards the lake. Speak to the ballooned up worms and you’ll be able to start the battle against the giant robot.</p>
<p>This fight is mainly about avoiding the robot’s projectiles. When you see the dotted line shown in the image below, do your best to get to a different platform before it fires a water beam at you…</p>

<p>It will also fire quick shots at you, so make sure that you’re quick and nimble.</p>
<p>Once the robot is out of water, it will makes its way over to the lake in order to suck up more with a straw. The platforms will move over to the water, so jump in, hold A to sink a little and use your body to clog up the straw.</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat two more times and that’s all there is to it!</p>
<p>After some dialogue, you’ll be taken by another giant robot and put into a jail cell.</p>
