<p>his all-original RS 4-speed convertible was purchased by the current owner for $57,000 back in 2012. Not quite content with its styling, said owner then invested a further $241,488 in the car - commissioning SEMA Builder Tom Argue Designs to breed a new kind of beast.</p>
<p>Completely stripped down, walnut shell blasted, and fitted with Heidt's front and rear suspension systems alongside a modern drivetrain, the car was then powder coated and painted Viper Blue. It seems no expense was spared on this Camaro. From the custom, one-off Budnick wheels to the black with blue stitching interior, the build utilized an impressive amount of hand made, one of a kind parts; making it a truly unique vehicle. And now it could be yours!</p>

<p>The “timeless body style with the heartbeat of a new Corvette” accelerates to 60 MPH in just 3.7-seconds and covers a quarter-mile in the mid 11s. Naturally, some stopping power is required, and this comes in the form of Wilwood 12-inch disc brakes and four-piston Dynalite aluminum calipers in the front. There's also Corvette C4 calipers in the rear. It may be a speed demon, but the car should stop just as quickly!</p>
<p>A custom-built exhaust, from headers to nicely tucked tips with X-pipe and Magnaflow mufflers, ensures a proper exhaust tone without resonation. After all, you can't have a car looking this good without a guttural exhaust tone.</p>
<p>The builds interior is like new, literally. It’s not just beautiful black leather with blue stitching, but a full custom and modern cabin. Equipped with power everything – alarm, navigation, backup camera, bluetooth and “ice cold a/c.”</p>
<p>There is a lot to get excited about with this Camaro but by far the most astonishing aspect of this car is the price.
