<p><strong>• <a href="https://itep.org/states-are-finally-going-bold-with-progressive-tax-efforts/"><strong>More States Want Tax The Rich</strong></a></strong>(Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy) — <em>At least nine states are considering budget proposals that would make their tax schemes more progressive, including multiple proposals to tax unearned investment income, a proposal to tax Wall Street financial transactions, proposed taxes on the top 1 percent, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-fires-more-of-trumps-labor-appointees_n_601ac57ec5b6f41348c5ee86"><strong>Biden Fires Anti-Union Trump Appointees</strong></a></strong>(HuffPost) — <em>This week, President Joe Biden asked all ten of Trump’s appointees to the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resign, and fired the two who did not voluntarily resign. “The FSIP is supposed to resolve bargaining disputes between federal agencies and worker unions,” HuffPost wrote. “But unions said Trump’s appointees were using the board to essentially rewrite collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms for workers.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/04/mckinsey-opioid-settlement-purdue/"><strong>McKinsey Pays For Role In Opioid Crisis</strong></a></strong>(Washington Post)<strong> — </strong><em>“McKinsey & Company, one of the world’s largest business consulting firms, has agreed to pay $573.9 million in a settlement with 47 states regarding its role in aiding drug companies during the opioid addiction epidemic.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/mitt-romney-child-allowance-covid-stimulus.html"><strong>Proposal To End Child Poverty Picks Up Steam</strong></a></strong> (New York Magazine) — Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/13/biden-stimulus-plan-childcare/">included</a> a universal child allowance in his $1.9 trillion budget proposal, a plan that would send parents money for each of their children, and could wipe out child poverty. Now, even Sen. Mitt Romney is on board, with his own bill, which would send parents $62,600 in child support by the time the child turns 18.</p>
<p><strong>• Larry Summers Is Out, Jared Bernstein Is In — </strong><em>Harvard economist Larry Summers led the charge for deregulation, which ultimately caused the 2008 financial crisis. In the Obama administration, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-obama-administration-in-one-memo/2011/08/25/gIQACRZcLQ_blog.html"><em>fought</em></a> to limit the size of its stimulus bill, leading to the <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/07/29/seven-years-later-recovery-remains-the-weakest-of-the-post-world-war-ii-era/"><em>weakest</em></a> economic recovery in the post-World War II era. Now, Summers is once again arguing for limiting stimulus. First, he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-democrats-motion-to-concede/"><em>pushed to limit</em></a> who’s eligible for COVID survival checks — something Democrats are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-dems-are-lucy-the-football/"><em>unfortunately considering</em></a>. Today, Summers <a href="https://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=16f10d0c7c5fd26041ab02f5ec5b38fe24a3e98bf20bc4935da4f98324e8fb7d46eccec05ddf56fbee3e0285519e2f52f5bebf3bd3afa540"><em>published</em></a> an op-ed arguing Biden’s overall COVID relief bill is too big and could ultimately hurt the economy. While Politico <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLizza/status/1357651422314180610"><em>reported</em></a> that “everyone in the West Wing is reading” Summers’ op-ed, Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1357713890952572931?s=20"><em>said today</em></a>, “The one thing we learned is we can’t do too much here.” And Biden economic advisor Jared Bernstein <a href="https://twitter.com/mmcassella/status/1357720524512583685"><em>pushed back</em></a> on Summers’ claims directly, stating: "I think he is wrong in a pretty profound way about that."</em></p>
<h4 id="organizing-that-we-hope-works"><strong>ORGANIZING (THAT WE HOPE) WORKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161242/joe-manchin-populist-grassroots-organizing"><strong>Grassroots Organizers In West Virginia Are Turning Up The Heat On Manchin </strong></a></strong>(The New Republic)<strong> — </strong><em>West Virginians have realized the outsized power that their senator Joe Manchin holds in American politics right now, and they are organizing to advocate for progressive policies that will improve their lives, and the structural reforms necessary to enact them: eliminating the Senate filibuster and making D.C. a state.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/kyrsten-sinema-pressure-campaign-goes-up-in-arizona/"><strong>Ad Campaign Pushes Sinema To End The Filibuster</strong></a></strong>(The American Prospect) — <em>After running in ad campaign in West Virginia to push Manchin to support stimulus checks and ending the filibuster, the No Excuses PAC is launching a second ad campaign in Arizona, this time to push Sen. Kyrsten Sinema to commit to ending the filibuster. “While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with its six-year terms, is more sheltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping this strategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1256856#blogHeader"><strong>These 62 Progressive Groups Are Also Working To End The Filibuster</strong></a></strong> (NBC) — <em>"We know some Democrats are still reluctant to eliminate the filibuster, but we're going to keep making the case that the promises Democrats made to deliver results must be prioritized over an outdated and abused Senate rule that is no longer working and can easily be changed," a representative from Fix Our Senate said.</em></p>
