<p>The group discusses how this 2006 film is terrifyingly reflective of today's world and our failing social systems. They also discuss its brilliant cinematography, the theme of “faith vs. chance,” as well as the various forms of organizing that activists utilize in the movie and what we can learn from them. Rivka and Frank also get into Mark Fisher’s theory of “Capitalist Realism,” and how it relates to film and creativity.</p>
