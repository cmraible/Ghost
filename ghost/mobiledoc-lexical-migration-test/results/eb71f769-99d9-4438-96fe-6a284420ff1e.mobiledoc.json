A pet capuchin monkey was stolen out of a vehicle sitting in the parking lot of Cub Foods on White Bear Avenue at about 8:30 pm on April 5. The unnamed victim contact Maplewood Police to report Coco Chanel, the capuchin monkey, had been monkey-napped."

We’re really curious just how many of these monkeys there are running around Minnesota. Supposedly, it’s illegal to own a monkey as a pet in the state, so obviously they’re all the rage. Actually, Steward lives in Wisconsin where it is legal, so she shouldn’t be in any trouble. The thieves on the other hand probably don’t care about the law."
