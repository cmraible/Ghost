The graphical department did an excellent job of creating some beautiful contrasting colour combinations to make the scenery pop. The remaster however still maintains the “brown level” colour aesthetic from the PS3/Xbox 360 era. Everything is just a little bit sharper and less fuzzy which is an improvement on the 2012 version, but I would be remiss not to mention the poor draw distance. With grass popping out just a few second job in front of you, a remaster in 2021 without attempting to clean this up just feels like lazy work. It’s a shame considering how making the game just that little bit sharper brings all the areas that could’ve been worked on into greater focus."
