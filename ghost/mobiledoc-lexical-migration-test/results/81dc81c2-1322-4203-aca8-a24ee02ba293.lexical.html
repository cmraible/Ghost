<p>Mobile gaming has been around since the days of the Microvision, the world’s first handheld console released in 1979 by Milton Bradley. Ever since then, there have been dozens of mobile gaming devices of varying popularity – including Game Boy, Nintendo DS, PSP – but none of them had really managed to replicate the experience of a home console or computer.</p>
<p>Nokia attempted to enter the mobile gaming market in 2003 with their N-Gage gaming phone, but the phone fell short of mobile gamers’ expectations. It wasn’t until the smartphone revolution came about with the advent of the iPhone that mobile phones started to have the capability to compete with their more powerful stationary counterparts.</p>
<p>These days, mobile gaming offers thousands of high quality games available for download with your smartphone at the touch of a button, including AAA titles such as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/is-super-mario-run-a-runaway-success-with-40-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Run</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft</a> and Pixel Gun 3D. While most mobile games can be run using any current generation smartphone, not every phone is built with gaming in mind and therefore will not provide the optimal experience for avid gamers.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we put together a list of the top performing smartphones for gamers. Whether you are an RPG gamer, a social gamer, a VR gamer, or even a casino gamer at sites like <a href="https://www.ninjacasino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NinjaCasino</a>, this list will help you find the best phone to meet your gaming needs.</p>
<h2><strong>Razer</strong></h2>

<p>The latest newcomer to the mobile phone scene, <a href="https://www.razerzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer</a> was launched on November last year and has received nothing but stellar reviews since. A mobile phone designed with gamers in mind, Razer has spared no expense to provide the finest mobile gaming experience currently available.</p>
<p>Boasting a never before seen 120 Hz 5.71″ IPS LCD screen, Razer offers a smooth and highly responsive experience the likes you’ve never felt on your phone before. Not only does this offer much crisper graphics, but its fast response vastly improves gameplay and the feeling of immersion.</p>
<p>As for its processing power, it features a with a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 2.35 GHz processor, an enormous 8GB of RAM, and a Adreno 540 GPU, a monstrous combination practically unrivalled by any other phone in the business. Add to that a huge 4,000mAh battery, and an expandable 64GB internal storage, and the best and loudest stereo speakers a mobile device has ever seen you have yourself a top notch gaming system.</p>
<p>While this phone is aimed mainly at gamers, at a price of around €700 this phone is perfect for just about any user that demands peak performance from their device.</p>
<h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy 8+</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-50045" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1-1024x683.jpg" alt width="770" height="514" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1-300x200.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1-768x512.jpg 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1-610x407.jpg 610w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1-1122x750.jpg 1122w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/samsung-galaxy-s8-1.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Samsung’s flagship phone, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/most-expensive-smartphones-released-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy 8+</a> features a combination of beautiful design and astounding processing power to become the second best option on our list.</p>
<p>Powered by a Samsung Exynos 8895 Octa or Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a Adreno 540 or Mali-G71 MP20 GPU, the S8+ includes up to 6GB of RAM, and up to 128GB internal memory. The display is a brilliant AMOLED capable of scaling up to QHD+ resolution (2960 x 1440) and featuring a 529 ppi density. Its 3,500 mAh battery also guarantees plenty of time for gameplay.</p>
<p>Along with its impressive specs, the S8+ has vastly upgraded the Game Tools and Game Launcher introduced in the Galaxy 7, providing gamers with a highly improved experience and integrating games better than ever before.  Game Tools is built into the navigation bar and will show up any time you load up a game, allowing you a plethora of useful options, such as turning off notifications, turning off the “invisible” home button, or allowing you to record the screen and even your reactions to the game using the front camera.</p>
<p>At a price of €850, it may seem like an expensive option in comparison with the cheaper Razor – which boasts better specs- but with Samsung’s impeccable design and reliability, and the fantastic non-gaming features it offers it is certainly worth its price tag.</p>
<h2><strong>OnePlus 5T</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-50046" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full-1024x683.jpg" alt width="770" height="514" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full-1024x683.jpg 1024w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full-300x200.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full-768x512.jpg 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full-610x407.jpg 610w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full-1320x880.jpg 1320w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/oneplus-5t-full.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>By far the most affordable phone on this list, the <a href="https://oneplus.net/se/5t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 5T</a> is a phone that punches way above its weight class. One of the fastest and most respectable phone manufacturers growing out of China, OnePlus received glowing reviews for their previous model, the OnePlus 3, and have managed to improve considerably with their latest offering.</p>
<p>Featuring a Snapdragon 835 SoC with the best clock speeds on this list, the OnePlus couples it’s octa-core 2.45 GHz CPU with a Adreno 540 GPU and 8 GB of RAM to deliver a lightning fast gaming experience. Add to that a 128 GB internal memory and a 3,300 mAh battery and you have yourself the best gaming phone that €559 can buy. You can even get a cheaper option for a mere €499 if you don’t mind having just 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage.</p>
<p>OnePlus also offers software features designed for optimal gaming, including the “Do Not Disturb” mode which blocks all notifications from popping up on top of your games. This mode can be customized to include any apps you want.</p>
<h2><strong>iPhone X</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-50047" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/iphone-x-space-gray-front-back-side-1024x857.jpeg" alt width="770" height="644" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/iphone-x-space-gray-front-back-side.jpeg 1024w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/iphone-x-space-gray-front-back-side-300x251.jpeg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/iphone-x-space-gray-front-back-side-768x643.jpeg 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/01/iphone-x-space-gray-front-back-side-610x511.jpeg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at one of the most hyped phone of all times and a true gaming dynamo. The only iOS phone on this list, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/iphone-x-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone X</a> not only features top of the line internals but also an extensive game collection that includes thousands of titles not available for Android users.</p>
<p>A bit step towards the future from Apple, the iPhone X does away with key elements of previous models such as the famed home button and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Instead it introduces face recognition and new methods of navigation that tend to simplify the overall experience.</p>
<p>But what makes this phone a great gaming machine? That would have to be its powerful A11 Bionic chip featuring a 64-bit architecture, a neural engine and an embedded M11 motion coprocessor. Combined with 3 GB of RAM and a 5.8-inch “Super Retina HD” AMOLED display boasting a resolution of 2436 x 1125 pixels, you can expect some pretty powerful results.</p>
<p>Apple’s new firmware also includes advanced augmented reality features which give game developers plenty to work with in creating the next generation gaming experience. This feature uses the iPhone X’s hugely powerful camera to overlay graphics to your surroundings, creating a highly immersive experience.</p>
<p>The downside? At a price point starting at $1,000 it is by far the most expensive phone on this list, and the most expensive flagship smartphone on the market. While it’s impressive 12-megapixel camera capable of recording 4K video at 60fps, its fantastically intuitive iOS 11 and fun Animoji features add to the overall experience, if you are a gamer on a budget you might want to stick to the Razer or OnePlus 5T.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
