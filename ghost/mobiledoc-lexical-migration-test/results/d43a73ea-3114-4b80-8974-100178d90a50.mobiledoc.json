          "Some say the spirit of the legendary Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona lives on in this aptly-named 812 Superfast. Considering this thoroughbred pumps out a stout 789-horsepower and has a 9000 rpm redline. From 0-60, this supercar clocks a scorching 2.8 seconds. If you want to go from a standstill to 100, it takes just 5.8 seconds. For a rear-wheel-drive vehicle those are incredible numbers and a testament to Ferrari engineering."

Wide Pirelli P Zero PZ4 tires provide astounding grip so you can stick turns like a master. Big carbon-ceramic brakes provide stopping power to match the surging acceleration."

Things certainly have changed as the team in Maranello has designed the cabin with excellent ergonomics, from the flat-bottom steering wheel with Italian stripes to the trio of green, white, and red buttons below the center dash. You’ll even love the digital displays and especially the way the seats hug you in place so you can throw this vehicle through turns with vigor."
