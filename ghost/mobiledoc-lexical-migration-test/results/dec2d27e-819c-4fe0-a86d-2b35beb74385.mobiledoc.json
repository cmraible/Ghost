Let’s just say that’s pretty impressive for an EcoBoost Raptor with that much use. Supposedly, that’s a record price for a Raptor. Obviously, someone really wanted to sit where Kanye had and live the fantasy. Either that or they realized a lot of other people do and they’re hoping that desire only increases with time, making the investment even more valuable."

That dealer smelled an opportunity and used a local auction house to get the maximum amount for each truck, a move which worked beautifully."

We can imagine they’re pretty happy with the results, but it’s unlikely they’ll have another star like Kanye West boosting their auction house anytime soon."
