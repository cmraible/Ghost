<hr>
<p>Nobody can forget the first time America saw the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11140">Hornet moniker</a>. Even if cars from the 1950’s is not your thing, the Hudson Hornet is an undeniable icon. Despite the model's iconic beginnings, it did not survive Hudson’s merger with AMC. <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11140">AMC did</a>, however, resurrect the name in 1970, hoping to make a name for its line of compact cars. </p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11140">The AMC Hornets</a> were available in nearly any body style which, ironically, diminished the name even though the Hornet S/C 360 was a formidable muscle car. With the Hornet on its way out the door, AMC called on another iconic name as a last ditch effort to garner the attention of the muscle car crowd and though it didn’t save the car it did leave us with this rare <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11140">1977 AMC AMX Hornet Coupe</a>.</p>
