<p>In 1989, these <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">36 classic Corvettes</a> were raffled off for the first time but before the winner even claimed his prize, the cars were sold to pop artist Peter Max. Originally intending to <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">incorporate the collection</a> into a piece of his artwork, he ultimately scrapped the idea and the cars were forgotten about and left to rot in a New York City parking garage. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">The Lost Corvette Collection</a> has since been rescued and restored and is now scheduled to be raffled again. This time to 36 different owners. Because of the massive size of this collection, the giveaway has been broken up into parts. Round one went off without a hitch and the first 10 cars have been awarded to their proud new owners but there are still 26 more that can be won.</p>
