<p>As <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-with-covid-19-car-theft/">COVID</a> continues to kill car shows from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/woodward-dream-cruise/">Detroit</a> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-cancelled/">Las Vegas</a>, there are still plenty of ways that enthusiasts – young and old – to indulge our passion and creativity from the safety of our living room. Chevrolet Performance's blog, <em>The Block</em>, is mourning the cancellation of the 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/10-coolest-tri-five-chevys/">Tri-Five</a> Nationals by providing a cool 1956 Chevrolet Nomad coloring page for Chevy lovers to download and customize.</p>

<p>Now, this isn't just any classic Nomad. It's one that Chevy's performance division spotted at the 2019 event, and it's a modified '56 Nomad packing an LS3 crate engine under the hood producing 430 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque. We don't get to see a picture of the car in real life, but through August of last year (when <em>The Block</em> first spotted the car), this 1956 Chevy Nomad has taken home three best-in-class show awards.</p>
<p>In real life, this Nomad is painted in a classic '50s two-tone treatment with a blue and gray exterior, but this black-and-white picture to create your own custom look. Throughout the Spring and Summer, we've seen several car-related coloring pages released by automakers (such as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-wins-for-covid-19-kids-creativity/">Ford</a>) and other entities (including <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ian-callum-pens-aston-martin-coloring-pages-for-kids/">Ian Callum</a>). These are helpful for parents looking to give their learning-from-home kids some extra art work or adults a little something to doodle on.</p>
