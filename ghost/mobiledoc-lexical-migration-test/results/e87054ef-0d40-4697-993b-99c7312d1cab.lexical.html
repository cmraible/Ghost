<p>Despite being the first of the moniker that would develop a cult like following of enthusiasts for the Pontiac Firebird, the Trans Am got off to a slow start and only 697 were produced and 8 of those were convertibles. Over 50 years later the remaining 689 iconic blue and white coupes have become increasingly hard to find, especially the few all matching numbers originals left. Classic Auto Mall is offering a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/178176/1969-pontiac-trans-am">2 owner 1969 Trans Am</a> with an original 83,979 miles for just under $114,000.</p>

<p>Everyone gets worked up over vintage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-broncos-contribution/">Ford Broncos</a> and K5 Blazers, but the International Harvester Scout Ii mostly flies under the radar.

This particular one has a cool look and plenty of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/be-restomod-cool-with-this-1949-chevy-3100-pickup/">modern upgrades</a>, too, so you could even use it as a daily driver.</p>
