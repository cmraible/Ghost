Some of the lesser recognized cars include a Mercury Cougar, a Toyota 2000GT Roadster, and a Ford Mustang. Claiming the title as the oddest selection is a Citroen 2CV.

This is especially true with classic cars as they offer the most blank slate, if you will. Now we are not saying that there is not something to be said about the classic style and modern performance of a properly done restomod, but rather just stating the clear fact that a car is only original once and if you find that well preserved original example of your favorite car, then you have found something truly special.

This shared admiration for the 1980s blossomed into the relationship that followed and just three years later they moved from Ohio to Florida which allowed them the opportunity to build an entertainment company, Dandera Entertainment Inc.
