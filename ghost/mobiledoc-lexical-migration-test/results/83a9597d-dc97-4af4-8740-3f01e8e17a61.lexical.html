<p>Produced continuously for 50 years from the 1930s to the 1980s, Cadillac's Series 75 was a large luxury sedan perfect for the family. Back in the day, the Series 75 was a stylish sedan that should have sold like hotcakes off dealership lots, but the expensive price tag at $2,445 proved to be too high during the Great Depression. Only 5,248 were sold back in 1936. Nowadays, a classic like this <a href="https://new.classiccarclub.org/vehicles/54/1936-cadillac-7523?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">1936 Cadillac 7523</a> is a highly coveted gem. The <a href="https://new.classiccarclub.org/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">Classic Car Club of America</a> is offering the perfect opportunity to take home this elegant example.</p>
