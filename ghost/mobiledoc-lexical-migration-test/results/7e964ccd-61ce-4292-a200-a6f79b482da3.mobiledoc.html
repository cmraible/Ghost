<p><em>The Guardian</em>‘s approach to open journalism sees the news outlet reach out to its readers in many different ways, including through soon-to-launch** community clinics**.</p>

<p><strong>Pop-up newsroom</strong>: Hacks/Hackers Brighton is becoming a Maker at the Mini Maker Faire. From 10am-2pm the Founders Room at the Brighton Dome will become a digital newsroom, allowing those who attend the Maker Faire to learn skills in digital news production. The event is free and all are welcome.</p>
<h2 id="whatistheminimakerfaire">What is the Mini Maker Faire?</h2>
<p>Maker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth – a family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity and resourcefulness, and a celebration of the Maker movement. It’s a place where people show what they are making, and share what they are learning. Activities for all ages include arts & crafts, robots and engineering, wood and metalwork, electronics, science, tech, music and more amazing do-it-yourself creation.</p>
<p>Over 5,000 people piled into the Dome for the first Brighton Mini Maker Faire in 2011, to witness the mind-boggling home-made creations of the best inventors, crafters, hackers and DIY-ers from across the UK – and they got involved: making, experimenting, playing, learning and interacting.</p>
<p><em>Brighton Digital Festival is a celebration of digital culture. It is run by members of Brighton’s arts and digital communities, administered by Wired Sussex in association with Lighthouse and supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.</em></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
