Your average person understands that trying to run from the law just multiplies your problems, so most just pull over and face their punishment like an adult. Then there’s this guy driving a Dodge Challenger RT, thinking he has a faster car than the Arkansas State Patrol trooper so he can easily get away. Likely he’s broken other laws and that’s why he’s running, but he’s still piling more charges on top of what’s coming."
