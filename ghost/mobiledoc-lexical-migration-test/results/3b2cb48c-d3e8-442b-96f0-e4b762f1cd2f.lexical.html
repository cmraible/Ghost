<p>The Nissan Skyline GT-R has topped the JDM dream car list of American gearheads since it first debuted in 1989, and what used to be an unobtainable dream can now be turned into a reality. For the past five years the car has been legal to import into the United States, and prices seem to have finally stabilized. For sale in the United States, the car is completely legal with a valid Virginia title. It has been cleared by customs, completely legal, and has all importation documentation.</p>
