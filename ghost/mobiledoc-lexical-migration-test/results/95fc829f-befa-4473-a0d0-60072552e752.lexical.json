Their innovations within the industry significantly impacted how we see cars today, even if the brand itself was a bit short-lived. Before closing its doors in 1957, this prestigious automaker had a reputation for making cars that combined a good mix of performance, luxury, and style for those looking for something you might not see every day. One such vehicle that embodied their creativity and passion in its every fiber was the Nash-Healey. With styling that reminds us a lot of the A/C Cobra and an interior design that seems more in place inside of some British or German convertible cruiser, these cars were an excellent choice for any automotive enthusiast with an appreciation for the performance.",
