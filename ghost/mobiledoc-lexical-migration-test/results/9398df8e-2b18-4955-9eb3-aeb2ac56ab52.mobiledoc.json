          "The Supervan story begins with Supervan 1, a vehicle that has been lost with no record of where it went. Back in its heyday, the first Supervan was effectively a Ford GT40 chassis with a Transit van shell. Instead of the rear cargo bay being full of building materials, it housed a 5.0-liter V8 engine that could get it to 150 mph. It also pinched a set of ventilated disc brakes from the GT40 to bring that performance under control."

A Cosworth supplied engine enabled this van to go even faster than its predecessor with a top speed now reaching 170 mph."

It actually wielded the same 630 hp Formula 1 Ford HB V8 engine found in Benetton racers during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Combined with slick tyres and its huge rear wing, this was a seriously fast vehicle when out on track. A Cosworth V6 engine was later fitted to Supervan 3 as it was easier to maintain than the F1 motor."
