<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.collectorsgarage.com/vehicles/2200078/1970-porsche-914-6-gt">Porsche set out</a> with the motorsport department to develop the 914’s in a lightweight unibody chassis, to be the pinnacle of racing development. This began in 1970, only a year after Porsche debuted the 914, and the 915-6 GT was the racing development variant of the mid-engine German sports car. Currently being offered by Broad Arrow Group is this 1970 Porsche 914-6 GT.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.collectorsgarage.com/vehicles/2200078/1970-porsche-914-6-gt">This Porsche</a> was racing in-house by Porsche System Engineering before being told to a customer through Werk 1, where it then received an extensive list of upgrades. It’s one of only 16 made and was raced across Europe until 1973. It is powered by a 2.0-liter 906 Carrera 6 twin-spark air-cooled flat-six cylinder engine that’s rated at making 210-horsepower at 8000 rpm.</p>
