<hr>
<p>For many <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/545/1992-dodge-daytona?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">Mopar enthusiasts</a> the Charger of the early 1970’s was the pinnacle of the muscle car era for Dodge. The model was fitted with nearly every high horsepower engine the automaker had to offer, including the ultimate HEMI engine. By the mid 1970s, <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/545/1992-dodge-daytona?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">Dodge shifted its focus</a> from the dying era to the growing personal luxury car market which led to massive changes for the model. </p>

<p>This move ultimately proved to be the end of the Charger as the Mopar alternative to the Mustang and Camaro, for two decades anyway. After its discontinuation in 1987, the Charger made a comeback as a competitor in the sub-compact market, <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/545/1992-dodge-daytona?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">still leaving Dodge</a> without a serious pony car competitor.</p>

<p>This all changed in 1984 with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/545/1992-dodge-daytona?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">Dodge Daytona</a>. While it did not start off as a car capable of competing with the Mustangs and Camaros higher powered offerings, the model evolved and in 1992 Dodge made a limited number of Daytona IROC R/T cars that put Dodge back in the game. In all only 341 were produced and only 75 were finished in Bright White Clear Coat, making this 1992 Dodge Daytona IROC R/T being offered by Raleigh Classic Car Auctions a true collectors car. </p>
