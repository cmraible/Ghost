<p>We all love a good truck, the problem is that most 'cool' old trucks are pretty run down. Never fear, however, because as long as there have been cool cars there have also been garage queens. <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1990-ford-f350-xlt-lariat/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This particular truck</a> was bought brand new in Chicago and driven to a garage space 1500 miles away and that's where this truck's journey ended for 30 years. Then after an extraordinary length of time, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1990-ford-f350-xlt-lariat/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this treasure</a> was brought out and put at auction. </p>

<p>The world of classic trucks is a creative and fun-loving community dedicated to the pursuit of happiness via off-roading, sport trucks, and even those awesome dropped drag trucks like the Chevy C-10. The fact that this truck is completely stock coupled with the 1500 mile driving history makes this the perfect platform for any of the aforementioned exploits. Oh but that isn't it, the interior of this truck is absolutely perfect. </p>

<p>This truck is obviously quite special, a piece of American history perfectly preserved for 30 years. There is almost nothing more American than a good truck. Ford really out-did themselves with this model, because when it comes to trucks this one just can't be beaten. It is astonishing that the owners were able to restrain the urge to drive this monster of a truck. Needless to say, whatever lucky soul that comes to own this in the future is going to have a heck of a good time.</p>
