<p>A few weeks ago, the commission that President Joe Biden set up to examine court reform published draft documents expressing skepticism about adding justices to the court, suggesting that doing so “could further weaken national and international norms against tampering with independent judiciaries.”</p>
<p>But as a new report authored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. makes clear, the nation’s highest court is already being tampered with — thanks to dark money and corporate meddling.</p>

<p>“The choice is really yours. As you make it, think of the Indigenous-led demonstrations last week and the five young activists from the Sunrise Movement who have been outside the White House on a hunger strike for nine days and counting. They're putting their lives on the line because they know that countless thousands will suffer and die if we continue on our current path. Just today, don't think of yourselves as the CEOs, think of yourselves as human beings. And I have this question, what would you do to end the hunger strike? What do you have to say to America's children born into a burning world?” — <a href="https://twitter.com/kartpath/status/1453748820169400323">Rep.

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>A new ABC News/Ipsos poll found that roughly <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-democrats-failing-sell-agenda-american-people-poll/story?id=80877850&cid=social_twitter_abcnp"><strong>7 in 10</strong></a><strong> Americans</strong> know just some or little to nothing about what's in President Biden's infrastructure and social spending bills. It found that 32 percent of Americans — including 47 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans — think the bills would hurt people like them, and only 25 percent think it would help them. <br></p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>As Congress nears a deal on Biden’s Build Back Better reconciliation bill, a separate battle is quietly playing out within the Democratic Party over how to handle the extremism and minoritarian rule of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Captured%20Courts.pdf">published a report</a> on the way that dark money and corporations have captured the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The report lays out how an extensive network of right-wing groups — including the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation, and organizations in the Koch network — have worked to appoint judges who undermine voting rights and favor corporate interests.</p>
<p>What is perhaps most remarkable about the report is that three senators, including the Senate majority leader, are raising serious questions about the legitimacy of an institution that many Democrats are unwilling to confront.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>For example, just two weeks earlier, the commission that Biden set up to examine court reform published draft materials of their own report. Those materials expressed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/14/politics/white-house-supreme-court-commission-materials/index.html">skepticism</a> about adding justices to the court, suggesting that it would be seen as a partisan move and undermine public trust in the court.</p>
<p>“Some commissioners believe that there is a real risk that the willingness of Congress to expand the size of the U.S. Supreme Court could further weaken national and international norms against tampering with independent judiciaries,” said the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MEMBERSHIP-AND-SIZE-OF-THE-COURT_.pdf">draft document</a> on court expansion, even going so far as to suggest that court-packing may be evidence of “democratic backsliding.”</p>
<p>But, as the three senators’ new report on “court capture” argues, the country’s highest court is already being manipulated.</p>
<p>Whitehouse <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/a-flood-of-judicial-lobbying-amicus-influence-and-funding-transparency">separately wrote</a> a law review article last week about the influence of dark money and dark money groups’ use of amicus briefs to influence the court.</p>
<p>“The effects of this litigation strategy on our democracy are frightening: the courts are becoming an arena for enacting policies by judicial decree that are too unpopular to pass through democratically elected legislatures,” he wrote. “These coordinated efforts warp the judiciary toward anonymous, ultrawealthy donor interests, all without the public ever learning about the role of dark-money interests in shaping the law.”</p>

<p>From 1945 to 1946, nearly five million workers, or 15 percent of the workforce at the time, united against employers of major industries to demand greater pay and benefits. In contrast, <a href="https://twitter.com/JonahFurman/status/1453858449738059780">around 15,000 workers</a> went on strike last month.</p>
<p>According to labor historian and activist Toni Gilpin, “What unions won in '46 ushered in the only period in modern American history when all income [growth] went to the bottom 90 percent of the population.” <a href="https://twitter.com/ToniGilpin/status/1455211063268552709?t=Mb6L8fz2HzIufIM1QBAEAQ&s=19">Click here to read Gilpin’s full thread</a> on the greatest strike wave in U.S. history.</p>

    <li><strong>NYC TAXI DRIVERS DEMAND DEBT FORGIVENESS: </strong>New York City cab drivers have been on hunger strike for over 10 days to secure debt relief that is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/10/22/dying-for-debt-relief-why-are-nyc-taxi-drivers-on-hunger-strike">crucial for their survival</a>. The striking taxi drivers — members of the 21,000-strong New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) — have spent more than a month outside New York City Hall asking the city to increase its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/nyregion/nyc-taxi-drivers-bailout.html">$65 million</a> debt relief program by another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/nyregion/ny-taxi-drivers-hunger-strike.html">$93 million</a>, an amount the union argues could help lenders cap outstanding medallion loan debt at $145,000, as long as the city guarantees it will pay for drivers who default on their loans. According to <em>Al Jazeera</em>, in the past, city officials “promoted medallions – the certification necessary to operate yellow cabs — as a reliable investment that, paired with hard work, could open the doors of prosperity.” Over time, industry leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/nyregion/nyc-taxis-medallions-suicides.html">artificially hiked</a> the price of taxi medallions to over $1 million, creating a bubble that burst in 2014 and left drivers with crushing debt. “We cannot afford to consign an entire generation of immigrant drivers who were sold a lie… to debt, to devastation, and to death,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1454940403699003392?t=1HZl1T5c4tqx3iySLihRQg&s=19">Zohran Kwame Mamdani</a>, a hunger strike participant.</li>
    <li><strong>HEALTH CARE POLICY COULD TACKLE INFLATION: </strong>A new <a href="https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/inflation-and-healthcare/">Employ America blog post</a> details how policymakers can leverage health care legislation and regulation to tackle inflation, since health care is a key area where the federal government holds significant direct authority on pricing. Skanda Amarnath, co-author of the post, argues: “Today’s price increases are being used to undercut the case for federal spending, especially on necessary climate and housing investments, even though these investments are essential to lowering the cost of living for all Americans.” The piece is part of <a href="https://www.employamerica.org/blog/the-inflation-management-mindset/">a broader case</a> made by the authors for the White House and Congress to proactively adopt an “inflation management” approach that uses policies to address the demand- and supply-side challenges feeding inflationary pressure, versus simply resorting to raising interest rates at the Fed. The authors promote Medicare drug pricing negotiation, a <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/public-weighs-in-on-medicare-drug-negotiations/">wildly popular</a> proposal in the Build Back Better reconciliation package that has been substantially watered down, as one of a number of policies that could “achieve substantial disinflationary effects without the demand destruction that rate hikes produce.” Read more in Amarnath’s <a href="https://twitter.com/IrvingSwisher/status/1455248711064379398?t=lswBnFu3Pt9zYw_lg0aKVA&s=19">Twitter thread</a> on the subject.</li>

    <li><strong>PARLIAMENTARIAN UNDER FIRE FOR PAST IMMIGRATION WORK: </strong>Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is <a href="https://www.latinorebels.com/2021/11/01/senateparliamentarianpast/">under fire</a> from immigrant rights’ advocates for her <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/new-parliamentarian-knows-her-way-around-072526">past stint</a> handling cases as a trial attorney in the U.S. Justice Department’s Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) branch. “As someone who has worked to deport people, she cannot be trusted to rule objectively on immigration issues,” said the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) in a recent <a href="https://www.raicestexas.org/2021/10/28/ignore-parliamentarian/">statement</a>. In September, MacDonough <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/574534-senate-parliamentarian-rules-out-democrats-immigration-plan-b">ruled to scrap reforms</a> in the Democrats’ then $3.5 trillion social spending package that would carve a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, a ruling <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/573007-omar-urges-biden-schumer-to-disregard-parliamentarian-on-immigration">progressive Democrats</a> urged Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Biden Administration to ignore. According to <em>Latino Rebels</em>, “MacDonough is expected to determine as early as this week whether a third immigrant relief proposal is aligned with the Senate rules for budget reconciliation.”<br></li>
    <li><strong>MANCHIN KEYNOTED SECRET COAL EXEC MEETING: </strong>Democrats’ coal baron senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was listed as the keynote speaker at the 2021 Coal and Investment Leadership Forum, a secret meeting in September attended by several coal company executives, according to <a href="https://www.theracket.documented.net/p/manchin-and-the-coal-barons?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1MDc4MjksInBvc3RfaWQiOjQzMjY2MjA0LCJfIjoiSFh4VTQiLCJpYXQiOjE2MzU3ODI1MDYsImV4cCI6MTYzNTc4NjEwNiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTIwMTEzNiIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.Vdl2vAYtfOwdKQb2yHbBomcpLv870s1nO1Cp7yWmV44">new reporting</a> from <em>Documented</em>. One of the attendees at the invite-only meeting was Joe Craft, the CEO of Alliance Resource Partners, who just last week <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/25/alliance-resource-partners-arlp-q3-2021-earnings-c/">praised Manchin on an investor call</a> for keeping “draconian measures” out of Democrats’ agenda bill that would have hurt the coal industry One of the so-called draconian measures that Manchin singlehandedly stripped from the legislation? The Clean Electricity Performance Program, a key element in achieving the Biden administration’s goal of 100 percent decarbonization by 2035. The corporate Democrat was in good company at the September forum: Climate change denier Chris Horner was also on the speaking roster. <br></li>
    <li><strong>CATHOLIC HEALTH PUNISHING STRIKERS: </strong>This week, the nonprofit hospital system Catholic Health <a href="https://twitter.com/abbyfridmanntv/status/1454892471725531140?s=21">announced</a> it will cut off health insurance coverage to Communications Workers of America (CWA) members participating in South Buffalo’s Mercy Hospital strike. President of CWA Local 1168 in Buffalo <a href="https://twitter.com/corigambini/status/1454904969765822465?t=I1BRAVIZifz4oYDwm-4FLA&s=19">said</a> in response to the health system’s decision: “CWA has a $425 million strike fund. We will cover all medical expenses for our members through COBRA or individual medical expenses.” Catholic Health joins cereal giant <a href="https://twitter.com/alexnpress/status/1451320737357344775?s=21">Kellogg’s</a> in stopping health benefits for workers on strike. As labor reporter Alex Press <a href="https://twitter.com/alexnpress/status/1451323533997584386">notes</a>, “tying health care to employment gives the boss an advantage every time.”</li>
