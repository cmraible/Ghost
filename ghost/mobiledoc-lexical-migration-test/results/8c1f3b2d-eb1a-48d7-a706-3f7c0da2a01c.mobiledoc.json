          "In 2020, the number of car thefts jumped a shocking 9-percent over the previous year and, when all was said and done, an astonishing 2,400 vehicles were stolen each day of the year. Even with these mind-blowing statistics, when compared with the number of cars registered for road use, having a car stolen is still a fairly rare occurrence. In fact, most people will never know the feeling of having their automotive property stolen and the ones that do will likely never have to go through the unfortunate experience ever again. One Dallas woman was not so lucky to be in the crowd of most. Not only was her prized Torch Red "

Thinking that her stroke of bad luck was a fluke and feeling that her apartment’s locked parking garage and a locked car cover would deter the thieves from being able to pull off the same heist again, Anderson replaced the car with a similar C7. Unfortunately, that was not the case and she was once again the victim of a car theft. Her replacement C7 Z06 was stolen from her apartment building's locked parking garage.  "

A total of 10 cars have been stolen from the same parking garage which signals an organization to the crimes."
