<p>In all the recriminations over the GameStop trading boomlet last month, billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya emerged as a conquering hero — on Twitter and in elite media, he was depicted as the rare swashbuckling, tech-age investor mustering the integrity to side with those righteously demanding justice for rapacious short sellers and hedge fund vultures. The mythmaking and the euphoric enthusiasm ultimately crescendoed with him <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chamath-palihapitiya-california-governor-venture-capital-politics-a16z-media-newsletter-2021-1">floating</a> the idea of a run for governor of America’s largest state.</p>
<p>A shrewd businessman, Palihapitiya was making an opportunity out of American politics’ age-old dream of an enlightened capitalist-turned-populist parachuting in to bridge the partisan divide and rescue the country.</p>
<p>But for all his tough-talking soundbites and his pop culture cred as a co-owner of the Golden State Warriors, Palihapitiya is not a typical man of the people — beneath the public image is a characteristic tech-industry oligarch promoting anti-government ideology, just repackaged and updated for the social media age.</p>
<p>Whether or not he ends up running for public office — he’s <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Chamath-Palihapitiya-California-governor-not-run-15924856.php">said</a> he’s “not ready” to run for governor — Palihapitiya represents a counter to the resurgent progressive wing of the Democratic Party: a corporate-friendly Third Way centrist, with a sprinkle of social justice rhetoric but also an intense devotion to libertarian free-market triumphalism all wrapped in popular memes.</p>
<p>From Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, the archetype is increasingly familiar in politics and in the online game of thinkfluence — but Palihapitiya has struck the most populist pose of all.</p>
