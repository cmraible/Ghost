          "Dodge, a brand we’ve been assured by many emotionally stable individuals wants people to die, has some tricks up its sleeve. We’re about to see some of the cards its been holding close to the vest during a reveal events scheduled for August 12-20. While we know the Dodge e-muscle car is going to be unveiled at that time, there’s plenty of speculation about what else will be revealed, including the secretive Tomahawk."

People get all worked up all the time when they hear about automakers trademarking different names, like the rumors about the Ford Thunderbird returning. But the fact is automakers sit on names for years on end without using them. For all we know, that’s what’s happening here."

          "Going back to the dodge reveal events in August, anything could be unveiled during those. We might see the new electric muscle car in action or it might just sit on a stage and do nothing. Dodge probably will show off some final editions for the Hellcats, similar to what it did for the Viper, but despite what some automotive journalists are saying, I don’t think this means the end of internal combustion engines for Dodge. No, no, forced induction with smaller displacement will be the bold way moving forward, when electrification isn’t the overpriced answer. This is going to be interesting to watch unfold."
