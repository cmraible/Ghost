Add in a well-documented history with just two owners since new, and it's easy to see why this Corvette is still in such impressive condition after all these years."

This Corvette received one repaint years ago refreshing the Classic White exterior paint, and this color is perfectly complemented by the saddle tan leather interior. One interesting part of this Corvette is that the urethane bumpers were upgraded to fiberglass, which means you won't see the fading or cracking of plastic-bumpered C3 'Vettes."
