You’re not as experienced, your cars don’t look nearly as sexy, and despite being a larger company your back is against the wall. You need a new racecar that will inspire people and perform outstandingly well in endurance events. That’s exactly what the Ford design team was facing back in the day, and thanks to someone at the company unearthing some old sketches, we can see how the GT40 program started out in a little different direction than the final product.",
