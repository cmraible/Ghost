It’s a great muscle car, but we’ve been itching to see how one would stack up against a Dodge Hellcat. We’ve seen a Buick Grand National with a Hellcat engine, but seeing the two cars face off against each other would be entertaining. Finally our wish comes true in the video accompanying this article."

The all-black appearance from the factory helps the otherwise benign body shape feel at least a little intimidating, but a non-car person wouldn’t be the least bit impressed."

While it’s cool to see these two muscle cars face off against each other, these guys really should’ve taken it to the track. Only they can answer why they didn’t, but we’re telling our readers that the risk or hurting or killing someone else, not to mention yourself, isn’t worth racing on public roads."
