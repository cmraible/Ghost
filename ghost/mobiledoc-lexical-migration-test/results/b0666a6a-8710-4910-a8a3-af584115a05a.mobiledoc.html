<hr>
<p>The Shreveport City Council has been debating about outfitting the police department with high-speed muscle cars. Originally, the proposal was to buy 4-6 Dodge Challenger Hellcats. After some debate among the members of the council, that was changed to 8 Dodge Chargers, we’re assuming not Hellcats, but maybe Scat Packs? The whole thing is pretty controversial.</p>

<p>The Mopar muscle cars are intended for the Shreveport Police Community Response Unit, a squad of 6-8 members who focus on pockets of the city with particularly high levels of crime, especially of a violent nature. Since a lot of well-funded criminals drive fast cars, including Hellcats, it makes sense the police want something which can go toe-to-toe with what the bad guys have.</p>

<p>After the special unit was retired, it’s been brought back thanks to members of the community recognizing its importance. Now it’s just a matter of getting the right cars for them to do their job effectively.</p>
<p>According to a local report, those Challenger Hellcats would cost the city about $100,000 each. Before you think they’re crazy, keep in mind police vehicles have to receive unique upfits made for law enforcement, pushing the cost beyond what you would pay for a Hellcat. That price tag didn’t sit well with some members of the council, hence the alternative proposal was made.</p>
<p>Those 8 Dodge Chargers come at a total price of about $300,000, so around half the original amount. Still, a vote by the city council to send a resolution to the mayor for his approval of the spending ultimately failed, so not everyone was on board.</p>
<p>Instead of just giving up, the council president still asked the mayor to consider the spending request, to which the mayor responded in the affirmative.</p>
