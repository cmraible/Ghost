<hr>
<p>Lotus knows how to stick with a good thing and <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">make it great</a>. As a small sports car company with limited resources, it's really the only option they've got.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">excellent Evora</a> has been around for a decade now. Originally, it was offered as a base model with the option of an Evora S, which featured a supercharged variant of the Toyota-sourced V6 mounted behind the passenger compartment.</p>

<p>In 2015, both models were replaced by the Evora 400. The name was a reference to the supercharged V6's power output of 400 horsepower. The <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">beautiful yellow example seen here</a>, from 2017, has covered just 5,500 miles since new.</p>
<p>While the car's first owner didn't drive it much, we can't say that we would have the same restraint. Every time we've had an opportunity to slide <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">behind the wheel</a> of a Lotus, the owners practically had to remove us with a crowbar. That has nothing to do with the car's cramped quarters.</p>

<p>These cars are simply sublime to drive. Lotus founder Colin Chapman operated under a simple ethos: "Simplify, then add lightness." The <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Lotus road cars</a> exemplify that short phrase to a T.</p>
<p>This Evora isn't as simple as it could be, of course. It was ordered with the <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">optional upgraded stereo</a>, which includes a subwoofer. We doubt any Lotus purists will complain, though. </p>

<p>If engine noise is more your thing, there's an electronically controlled exhaust valve to raise (or lower) the noise level to your liking. Also, we're happy to report that <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Evora</a> has a six-speed manual transmission. An automatic was available, but a British sports car with an automatic is just <em>wrong</em>. We don't care how much faster the automatic is; it's less fun.</p>
<p>You can find this Evora at <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/461/2017-lotus-evora-400&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Crown Concepts</a> in Tucson, Arizona. For just $77,929, you can own an excellent example of the Evora 400.</p>
