The seller states it went through a frame-up restoration, so you’re getting a great-looking vehicle that’s faithful to the original. Many 356s were painted red like this replica. The black convertible top includes full side window panels for complete coverage in bad weather. Among the details are chrome headlight cages, a correct rear deck luggage rack, and full correct tonneau cover for the top. The whole thing rolls on new 15-inch radial tires wrapped around wheels covered by Porsche dog dish hubcaps"

          "The 356 was the first road car to wear the Porsche name when it launched in 1948, making it historically of incredible importance. It started off as a crude vehicle, using parts removed from Volkswagens, but then the 356 caught on and production took off in the early 1950s. Production ended in 1965, leaving behind a lasting legacy. Today, to buy a genuine 356 is quite expensive, and the 1956 Porsche 356 A 1600 Speedster is especially sought-after, which is why this replica is so compelling. You can bid on it through "
