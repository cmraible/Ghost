<p>Back on October 23 Instagram account zr1_m7 shared one of the sadder images we’ve seen lately: a busted-up C8 Corvette Z06 sitting sideways at an intersection. Taken in Bloomfield, Michigan, the photo is the aftermath of an accident and has people quite upset. Considering production for the new Z06 will be quite limited and lots of enthusiasts and collectors can’t wait to get their hands on one, that’s understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Check out this C8 Corvette that crashed into a backyard pool in California <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-pool/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is the first example of a C8 Corvette Z06 crashed on a public road, although sadly it’s not going to be the last. Despite boasting excellent handling, many drivers have found their mid-engine ‘Vette was too much to handle as their skills were outstripped by the machine’s performance capabilities. Thus, we’ve covered some pretty gnarly <a href="https://theautowire.com/articles/guy-rents-c8-corvette-crashes-it/">C8 Corvette crashes</a> and surely more will be coming.</p>
<p>According to the Instagram account in question, this is an M-plate car or in other words is a pre-production model owned by Chevrolet. Such vehicles oftentimes are destroyed in testing or otherwise dismantled, although not always, so this car’s fate might have already been grim.</p>
<p>We don’t know if there were any injuries involved in the wreck or even what other vehicle(s) might have been involved. <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a41756683/c8-corvette-z06-crash-first/">Road & Track</a> says the other car was a Volkswagen Jetta and that there were no injuries reported.</p>
<p>Sadly, other C8 Corvette pre-production cars have met horrible fates while being tested. For example, we covered an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/e-ray-prototype-burns/">E-Ray prototype burning to the ground</a> in Spain’s Sierra Nevada, a mountain range in Granada. Photos of the vehicle after the fire was put out shows melted body panels and deformed wheels, so the fire must’ve burned pretty hot. And thus is the fate of many pre-production cars.</p>
