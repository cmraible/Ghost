Orbicular features such as the headlamps, fog lights, door mirrors, and rear light cluster add to the Cube’s friendly, welcoming aura. As a result, children usually adore the Cube right from the get-go, with most prone to giving the Cube an affectionate pat or hug.

Surely no one, in their right mind, would use a fridge inspired door on a car? Think again - the BMW Isetta micro-car had only one side-hinged door on the front, which also happened to be used on deep-freezers! Launched in 1953, there are now countless Isettas found within automotive museums. The Isetta’s creative use of resources and ‘out of the box’ thinking is now clearly appreciated six decades on."

Said to have been inspired by the enveloping curves of a jacuzzi, the dashboard and seats bend gently while a water-ripple effect has been incorporated into the headliner, speaker covers, and cup holders."

In the US, the Cube comes powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 122-horsepower with an option for automatic or a six-speed manual transmission. Meanwhile, European customers had the 1.6L gas or 1.5L diesel engines to choose from, familiar options from the much more prevalent Nissan Note, with auto and manual transmissions both available."

An average 35mpg from the 1.6L engine is respectable, while the 1.5L diesel engine can manage an impressive 54mpg – good for those driving on a budget. Meanwhile, steering is light and communicative while the Cube’s ride comfort is superb – good enough to chop cucumbers without injury over a rough road. If you like."
