          " features a new take on the two world mechanic that many games have used in the past. Every level has two worlds, each with different geometry to navigate. The fresh twist on this mechanic, and most likely what inspired the title of the game, is the rift that splits the two worlds. Using the right stick, you can control the rift’s position, revealing more of one world while hiding the other. With the shoulder triggers, you can rotate the rift. This creates a gameplay experience that challenges your spatial awareness, your ability to carefully consider your next steps and your creativity with the utilization of the rift. Your character’s movement options are extremely limited, relegated to walking on flat surfaces and a very short, very shallow jump, so a lot of your vertical movement relies on the rift. There are a few methods to achieve this: one way is to position the rift horizontally close to the bottom of where a column would be and in the other world, placing your character on top of the column that is there and raising the rift - As the column comes into existence, your character is elevated until the rift passes the top of it; another way is to position the rift at a diagonal, cutting a column on a slant to make a ramp to walk up.

If you are standing on a platform on one world that is in the middle of a column in the other and you move the rift too fast, you can be crushed; or if there is no platform on the other world and you move the rift, you will fall to your death. As the game progresses and enemies are introduced, handling the rift without a plan could end with enemies being released into your path, making completing a level difficult to impossible. "

There are six worlds, each with ten levels to complete. Although score isn’t considered when unlocking a new level, completionists will find their work cut out for them with the stringent goals needed to obtain gold scores. The game also features a co-op multiplayer, with two characters and two rifts to control, which adds in a third world to navigate."

          "Each world, that is to say grouping of 10 levels, has two backdrops in each level. These tend to be opposites when it comes to their design. For example in World - I, one backdrop is a turquoise coloured field with spacely-placed trees while the other is a lavender fading into cream coloured sky with tall, leafless trees. In World - II, we have a peachy pink and orange sky with a tropic design, contrasted with a deep sapphire coloured world and a background of a city’s skyline. The levels are pleasant to look at but also visually dissimilar enough to not cause accidental confusion between the worlds."

          "The music design is somewhat reserved. Each world alternates between two songs for each level, ranging from calming keyboards and bass guitars, to ethereal xylophone and harps, to upbeat pianos and plucky string instruments. Overall, the music is a pleasant addition to the game but the lack of variety can feel samey after a while. Imagine getting stuck on a level for a long while, beating it and breezing through to the next, only to be met with another level with the same song you just listened to for 20 minutes. "

          " from the first level and I thoroughly believe any fan of puzzle games will feel the same. It’s a game that challenges you mentally by completely changing your perspective on two worlds and how to progress through them. However, the game is not without its flaws. The music, while nice, can feel a little samey after a while. There are puzzles in which a simple, easy to make mistake can make the puzzle impossible to solve, which is something I personally think shouldn’t be a part of puzzle games. While not a flaw at all, those that look for a narrative element to their games will be disappointed by the game’s lack of story. All told, I think "
