<p>Good things are happening! A new renewable energy study sets the record straight (again): Switching to 100 percent renewable energy is far more attainable than imagined and could immediately reduce energy prices. Also, California will ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, the U.S.‚Äôs first freshwater wind farm will finally get built, and scientists discover a process of destroying ‚Äúforever chemicals.‚Äù </p>
<p>All this and much more in this week‚Äôs edition of <em>You Love To See It</em>, exclusively for supporting subscribers below. </p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="in-six-years-renewable-energy-would-pay-for-itself">In Six Years, Renewable Energy Would Pay For Itself</h3>
<p>As if switching to renewable energy needs any <a href="https://reneweconomy.com.au/a-near-100-per-cent-renewables-grid-is-well-within-reach-and-with-little-storage/">more</a> justification, a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/145Country/22-145Countries.pdf">new study</a> has found that electrifying all energy sectors would immediately create lower energy prices. Moreover, all of the up-front costs of transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy would be <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/100-renewable-energy/">paid back</a> in just six years.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mzjacobson/">Professor Mark Jacobson</a>, the study‚Äôs lead researcher, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/06/30/we-dont-need-magic-technologies-renewable-energy-transformation">said</a>, ‚ÄúBy electrifying all energy sectors; producing electricity from clean, renewable sources; creating heat, cold, and hydrogen from such electricity; storing electricity, heat, cold and the hydrogen; expanding transmission; and shifting the time of some electricity use, we can create safe, cheap, and reliable energy everywhere.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="california-will-ban-new-gas-car-sales-by-2035">California Will Ban New Gas Car Sales by 2035</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/climate/california-gas-cars-emissions.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes">ban</a> will make California the only government in the world to mandate zero-emissions vehicles. California is the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/california-about-to-take-huge-step-of-banning-new-gas-car-sales-by-2035">largest</a> auto market in the country, and at least fifteen other <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/%C2%A7177%20States%20%283-17-2022%29%20%28NADA%20sales%29.pdf">states</a><a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2022/04/california-electric-cars-rule-zero-emissions/">have pledged</a> to follow California‚Äôs auto emissions standards. The ban is set to roll out in stages ‚Äî by 2026, 35 percent of new vehicles sold must produce zero emissions, followed by 68 percent by 2030, and 100 percent in 2035.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a hugely important inflection point,‚Äù Daniel Sperling, a member of the Air Resources Board, told <em>CalMatters.</em> ‚ÄúThis rule finally, definitively puts us on the path to 100 percent zero-emission vehicles.‚Äù While other nations have <a href="https://theclimatecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Survey-on-Global-Activities-to-Phase-Out-ICE-Vehicles-update-3.18.20-1.pdf">created plans</a> to phase out gas-burning cars, California is the <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2022/04/california-electric-cars-rule-zero-emissions/">only</a> government to have adopted a rule that bans them.</p>
<p>Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, told the<em></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/climate/california-gas-cars-emissions.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes"><em>New York Times</em></a> that California‚Äôs regulation ‚Äúwill set the global high-water mark for the accelerated transition to electric vehicles.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="the-us%E2%80%99s-first-freshwater-wind-farm-to-be-built-at-last">The U.S.‚Äôs First Freshwater Wind Farm To Be Built At Last</h3>
<p>Last week, the Supreme Court of Ohio cleared the way for the country‚Äôs <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/first-north-america-freshwater-wind-farm-wins-ohio-court-case">first freshwater offshore wind farm</a> to be built on Lake Eerie. The energy project, called Icebreaker Wind, will include six wind turbines that will <a href="http://www.leedco.org/index.php/about-icebreaker">produce</a> 20.7 megawatts in an area with few other renewable energy projects. While these first six wind turbines represent just a fraction of what could be built in the Great Lakes area, the project is estimated to create more than 500 jobs and have a $253-million economic impact on the region.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Obama administration <a href="https://www.power-grid.com/renewable-energy/in-great-lakes-states-obama-administration-strikes-agreement-for-offshore-wind/">estimated</a> that the Great Lakes could support enough offshore wind capacity to power 210 million homes.</p>

<h3 id="starbucks-forced-to-rehire-illegally-fired-union-leaders">Starbucks Forced To Rehire Illegally Fired Union Leaders</h3>
<p>Late last week, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) won a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-region-15-wins-injunction-requiring-starbucks-to-rehire-seven">court injunction</a> requiring Starbucks to reinstate seven illegally fired workers who were trying to organize their workplaces in Memphis, Tennessee. The NLRB is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/starbucks-ordered-to-reinstate-us-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-tennessee">currently</a> investigating how the coffee chain has interfered with workers‚Äô organizing rights, including by shutting down stores and firing other union supporters.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs federal court decision ordering Starbucks to reinstate the seven unlawfully fired Starbucks workers in Memphis is a crucial step in ensuring that these workers, and all Starbucks workers, can freely exercise their right to join together to improve their working conditions and form a union,‚Äù said NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo in statement. ‚ÄúStarbucks, and other employers, should take note that the NLRB will continue to vigorously protect workers‚Äô right to organize without interference from their employer.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cforever-chemicals%E2%80%9D-have-met-their-match">‚ÄúForever Chemicals‚Äù Have Met Their Match</h3>
<p>Chemists from Northwestern University in Illinois and University of California Los Angeles have collaborated to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/89ca02cb-7918-4fc5-b98f-a2c8b605b65e">develop</a> a low-cost, low-energy method of breaking down some of the most important kinds of ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù ‚Äî harmful synthetic compounds previously thought to be indestructible. Project leader William Dichtel told <em>Financial Times</em>, ‚ÄúWe wanted to use chemistry to create a solution that the world can use. It‚Äôs exciting because of how simple, yet unrecognized, our solution is.‚Äù</p>
<p>Exposure to ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù depresses the immune system, increases the chances of kidney cancer, and slows infant growth. A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02765">recent study</a> found that these chemicals have been identified in rainwater samples across the world, making rainwater potentially unsafe to drink globally. This new process of destroying the chemicals marks a breakthrough in the possibility of decontaminating drinking water.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read a short poem by Kay Ryan, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet-books/2006/12/journal-day-four-56d34c81a52f6">Swept Up Whole</a>‚Äù:</p>
