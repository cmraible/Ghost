Secondly, with a fixed over wing design, they’re not exactly practical to drive on roads since they’d exceed the marked lane lines. AeroMobil has its wings on hinges so they fold back, but the car is still pretty long. And finally, flying a plane requires special certifications, authorizations, and other regulations which would keep most people away from buying one of these things. Despite these challenges, the Slovak firm thinks it can attract enough consumers to make its venture worthwhile.",

With a range of about 460 miles, you’re also not going to be doing any crazy cross-country flights, at least not in one leg. The takeoff distance is about 1300 feet, which throws some cold, hard reality over the heads of people who envision themselves taking off from their driveway. Also, the rate of climb is 1200 feet per minute, ensuring taking off somewhere like Manhattan would be impractical. Pretty much everything we’ve seen in movies pertaining to flying cars is inaccurate, which shouldn’t shock any adult.",
