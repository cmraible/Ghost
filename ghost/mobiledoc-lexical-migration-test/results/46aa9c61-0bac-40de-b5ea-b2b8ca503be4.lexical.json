We have Petersen Automotive Museum to thank for the tour. The Museum has been doing an excellent job of posting videos of places you might not otherwise have been able to visit.",

While there are dozens of rides parked all over, Bruce Canepa says the emphasis isn’t on the quantity of vehicles but rather the quality. All are in showroom condition, highly original, with no signs of blemishes and plenty of gleaming surfaces everywhere. A quick glance shows many Porsche 911s and others from the German automaker. However, there are plenty of BMWs, Mercedes, motorcycles, and even a Toyota FJ40 scattered about.",
