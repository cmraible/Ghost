I’m more of a traditional/insular gamer in that I grew up in the 90’s (i.e. the pre-internet gaming era) and therefore rarely play online; I’m happier playing through a single player campaign on my own than online with a bunch of randoms! But that’s just me. I go weak at the knees for any Metroidvanias these days and much prefer games of that ilk over more linear games. I’m fortunate enough to work in the games industry in my day job too which is great fun. Based in the UK, I recently dug out all my old consoles to revisit some of my childhood classics on the SNES, Megadrive etc. Other hobbies/passions include football (as in soccer), craft beer and updating Wikipedia football/soccer pages.

I love to dissect and analyse media, especially video games, so I jumped on the chance to become a part of this wonderful group of people. My video game tastes are incredibly inclusive, put anything other than a major league sports game in front of me (anything with the acronyms) and I’ll play it for at least a few hours. I own every big name console except for an original PlayStation, PlayStation 4, and an Xbox Series X. Some day, I hope you’ll know my name by the books I will one day finish writing. "

I've written for a lot of different gaming-related sites and some you may know very well, including SwitchWatch, Rapid Reviews UK and dozens others. And here I am doing it again on Switchaboo. I've mostly worked in arts in my early years but now I'm currently working in fashion. It's not my dream job, but it pays the bills lol. "
