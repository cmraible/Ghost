This cammed 454 is also sporting a pair of “old school” headers that the owner polished up and put on the car. Of course, you can't mention the car without also talking about the massive nitro capabilities that this thing is packing. According to the owner, the car can handle up to a 250 shot of nitrous, which is enough to blow away anything that might pull up to the line next to it, however, he typically runs a 100 shot for safety sake. The nitrous system is controlled with a digital box which also allows for two-step to be used on the car. Without the nitrous system the Chevelle is making about 400 horsepower to the wheels, however, torque is the main focus with this car with the engine rolling out 500 lb/ft of torque.",
