<p>Between <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/kids-steal-cars/">COVID-19</a> and recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-orlando-classic-cars/">protests-turned-riots</a>, there has been an abundance of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic</a> cars being stolen lately, but at least some of these vehicles are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1969-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-crashed-recovered/">being recovered</a>. Fortunately, that is the situation with the 1966 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/15-movie-cars/">Plymouth Fury</a> that was stolen on May 22nd from the Sacred Heart Cathedral Catholic church located in Gallup, New Mexico. In an email from Rev. Matthew Keller, police recovered the vintage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/check-out-this-pair-of-one-off-70s-mopars/">Mopar</a> over the weekend along with its trailer, and the only damage done to the car is a broken driver's side vent window. No arrests have been made, but we're glad to hear the church got its car back!.</p>

<p>The Plymouth had been donated to V8s For Vocations â€“ a fundraiser setup by Rev. Keller to raise money for seminary students studying for priesthood at the Diocese of Gallup. According to a Facebook post by Rev. Keller, this car was donated by the widow of the previous owner who had owned the car for 50 years, and it was being sold to a buyer who planned to fix it up.</p>
<p>The saddest part about this theft is that it occurred on the morning it was to be sold to a new buyer. The Plymouth had been parked in the church's parking lot secured to a trailer and attached to a hand railing using a large chain. At around 7 a.m. on May 22nd, two men hooked up a dark blue or black Chevrolet Silverado to the trailer and then proceeded to pull the car until the chain and railing broke. The incident was caught on a security camera, and it gives a decent look at the truck as well as the two individuals who stole the car.</p>
