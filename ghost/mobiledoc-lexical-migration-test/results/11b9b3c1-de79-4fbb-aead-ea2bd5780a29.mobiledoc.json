The heart of this beast is a Lotus-developed 5.7-liter LT5 V8 that was rated at 375 horsepower, which was far superior to the 245-horsepower rating of a base 1990 Corvette. A six-speed manual gearbox sends this power to the rear tires that are so wide that the ZR-1 received exclusive body to widen the rear haunches."
