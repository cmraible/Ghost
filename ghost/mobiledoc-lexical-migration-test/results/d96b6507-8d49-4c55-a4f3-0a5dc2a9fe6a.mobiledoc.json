According to the oil and gas lobbying group the American Petroleum Institute, what the country needs to be focused on right now, in the middle of this humanitarian crisis, is securing “energy security at home and abroad” — by expanding oil and gas production at home. But even as the lobbying group was calling for more domestic drilling to prepare for dwindling foreign fossil fuel assets, it was also calling on the U.S. government not to place sanctions on Russian oil and gas production. In other words, according to fossil fuel companies, the best way to deal with this catastrophe is to drill, baby, drill… everywhere."
