Even if they did, if you’re financially responsible, you’d be pretty nervous flogging the car on public roads. So it’s understandable why anyone would be skeptical of just how good the Singers are."

You wouldn’t expect that a lightweighted, rear-wheel-drive Porsche with a 4.0-liter flat-six in the back could present some big driving challenges, yet he claims it’s anything but a beast to manage. In some ways that’s disappointing but in some ways that’s great, because sometimes you don’t want to wrangle your car, even if it’s your hobby ride. Check out the review for yourself for more details."
