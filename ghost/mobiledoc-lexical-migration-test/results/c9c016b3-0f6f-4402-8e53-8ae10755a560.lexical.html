<p>Coming from a company that specializes in building world-class racecars, it's no wonder that the Panoz Esperante is such an incredible sports car in its own right. This 2005 Panoz Esperante is powered by a monster supercharged 4.6-liter Ford SVT V8 paired with a T56 six-speed. It is now up for grabs from <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-panoz-esperante-3/">Bring a Trailer</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-panoz-esperante-3/">These cars</a> featured an all-aluminum body atop an aluminum chassis resulting in a curb weight similar to that of a Mazda Miata, which means these cars are enjoyable for track days or weekend jaunts through the twisty backroads. With just 8,400 actual miles showing on the odometer, there are plenty of years of enjoyment left in this Esperante.</p>
