          "We just learned Leonardo DiCarprio has a biography out, in which he apparently talks about his first car, a 1969 Ford Mustang. The Hollywood star who’s famous for preaching about eco-consciousness while owning many sprawling estates, bought the pony car at the ripe age of 16. Apparently, teenage Leonardo hadn’t learned such an act will kill the planet, but he did learn it would almost kill him."

We’re assuming this was in Southern California where people can be quite aggressive in their driving habits, so maybe he did almost perish when his Ford left him stranded on the side of the road."

          "After the ’69 Mustang failed him three times, we imagine Leonardo learned the errors of his ways, bought an electric car, and never looked back. It seems what he purchased next is skipped over since he probably got a big, gas-guzzling SUV since those were all the rage back in the 90s. Instead, the media is focusing on how he owns a bunch of all-electric and hybrid cars now. He also globetrots in private jets a lot, so he definitely is concerned about vehicle emissions. Oh, and don’t forget about his superyacht which puts out more carbon than a whole fleet of ICE cars."
