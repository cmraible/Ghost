A humble truck from the factory can be turned into a tire shredding beast of a vehicle Pretty easily but this builder decided to take his project to the limit.",

Mated to that motor is a strongly built 6-speed tremec manual transmission. This drive train allows for great control and about 570 wheel horsepower contrasting the 508 pound feet of torque at the tire. Overall this is an incredible truck, built for auto crossing and road racing events, and the guys who made it obviously knew what they were doing. The only question left is, who will have the guts to try and challenge this C10?",
