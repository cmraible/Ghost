After all, other than the blacked-out exterior, it looks similar to something their grandpa drove back in the day. That’s why people seem to be freaking out about a GNX which caused quite the bidding frenzy on eBay recently, the final bid coming in at $249,999 to set a new record for the site. They probably think car people are all a bunch of idiots."

Prices for the 80s classics are definitely on the rise, with several selling this year for beyond $200,000. If this trend keeps up, it might not be long before they’re selling for over $300,000. In fact, with the way inflation is these days, that could be next month."

They were the final celebration of the go-fast Grand Nationals which embarrassed Ferraris, Porsches, and even Corvettes in the 1980s. That alone makes the GNX a kind of legend, because when else has a Buick spanked the world?"

There are just 426 miles showing on the odometer. Considering it’s a 34-year-old car, that’s quite the thing. The seller says it’s been in “a long hibernation” in a facility that’s climate controlled. What’s more, it’s supposed to run perfectly and has been maintained impeccably."
