So what’s wrong with this "

Pretty much every body panel has been rusted to the point that it almost seems impossible to save. On top of that, the floorboards are pretty rough, to say the least. Overall, it’s hard to say that the car doesn’t have any imperfections but that doesn’t mean it’s past the point of no return."

Granted, the original powertrain is nowhere to be found where the car is likely serving as a donor. However, if you can manage to find numbers matching or period correct parts then you might just have a valuable collector's item. No matter what happens to the car it’s hard to lose your current state which is exactly why we hope somebody saves it soon."
