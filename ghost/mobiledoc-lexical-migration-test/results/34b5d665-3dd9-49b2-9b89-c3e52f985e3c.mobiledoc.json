In a Nazi occupied Norwegian town of Sundäe, the Okkulte-55 is on a mission to put an end to the war by unleashing an ancient curse. Alexei Krakovitz, a quadriplegic professor with the ability to communicate with the dead, and Akiro Kagasawa, Alexei’s faithful assistant from Japan, are on a mission to put a stop to the Nazi’s evil plans by going undercover in classic adventure style. With dry dark humour that’ll sure to have you smiling from ear-to-ear with slight pangs of guilt as shiny red cherries on top, "

These moments have Akiro with his occasionally jamming pistol taking on Nazi soldiers, German Shepards and zombies. The combat isn’t anything to write home about as you simply move, roll and shoot left or right. In the later segments, you can pick up more powerful guns but they quickly run out of bullets, leaving you needing to go back to Akiro’s pistol that somehow contains an infinite number of bullets."
