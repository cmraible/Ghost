The latter Sindelfingen coachwork remains truly decadent even by today's standards, with sweeping fenders, elongated hood, and a proud grille. Delicate chrome details separate the two-tone paintwork that highlights the handsome design."

This example plays host to the more potent 180-horsepower 5.4-liter supercharged motor and a four-speed manual transmission. Its impressive 110mph top speed is kept in check by advanced servo-assisted hydraulic brakes."

It is believed that Sindelfingen built just 32 Mercedes in this Cabriolet A configuration, with just 18 surviving today. During the 1960s, the Benz was exported to France and then Germany, before finding its way to Switzerland. Passing from owner to owner over the years, the car’s history – and sometimes costly maintenance – is well documented."
