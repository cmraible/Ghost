<p>Friends:</p>
<p>For months, we have been exposing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis‚Äô corruption. Most recently, we reported on how a political operative linked to the largest dark money political donation in history is leading the super PAC supporting DeSantis‚Äô potential 2024 presidential run.</p>
<p>As the 2024 presidential election looms, it is essential that Ron DeSantis be held accountable for incidents like this one and much more. <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/demand-gov-ron-desantis-stop-censoring-teachers-students-and-journalists?source=group-lever-actions&referrer=group-lever-actions&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fthe.levernews.com%2Faction-network-thank-you%2F"><strong>We come to you with a Lever Action this weekend designed to do just that</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>From our friends at <em>The Intercept:</em></p>
<blockquote>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is doing everything in his power to stifle debate, silence and punish his critics, and cancel the free speech rights the First Amendment grants the press and public.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/forms/demand-gov-ron-desantis-stop-censoring-teachers-students-and-journalists?source=group-lever-actions&referrer=group-lever-actions&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fthe.levernews.com%2Faction-network-thank-you%2F">It‚Äôs time for this to stop</a>.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>DeSantis has already made headlines over his repeated attempts to censor Florida teachers and schools, shutting down African American history classes, and restricting discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in schools. Now, DeSantis and his allies want to silence journalism by making it dramatically easier for politicians to sue reporters and win.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If DeSantis gets his way, the Florida Legislature could rewrite the state‚Äôs defamation laws and gut protections for anonymous sources, making it impossible for reporters to do their jobs without exposing themselves to massive legal risk. Parts of these bills are so radical that even Koch-funded groups and right-wing radio stations oppose them.<br>But DeSantis‚Äôs punitive approach to speech isn‚Äôt limited to the press. He‚Äôs repeatedly tried to make an example of teachers and students to score points in the right-wing culture war.</blockquote>
