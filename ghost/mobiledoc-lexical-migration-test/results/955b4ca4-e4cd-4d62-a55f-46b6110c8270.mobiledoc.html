<p>With the Supreme Court <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-roe-disaster-and-what-to-do-about-it-2/">preparing to abolish</a> people’s constitutional right to an abortion by striking down <em>Roe vs. Wade</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/_7jU5Z22sBQ">our new video</a> exposes one of the individuals most responsible: Leonard Leo, the anti-abortion zealot and Trump judicial adviser who has spent years moving the court towards this decision using tens of millions in dark, untraceable money.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="https://contextly.com/redirect/?id=VGBYslsdtl:6271f021197198003d63f5ac:9081:18:RVM=::previous:62755ab070f764-20438725">this</a> and <a href="https://contextly.com/redirect/?id=TDwtuGQ2Md:6271f021197198003d63f5ac:9081:18:RVM=::previous:62755ab070f764-20438725">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
