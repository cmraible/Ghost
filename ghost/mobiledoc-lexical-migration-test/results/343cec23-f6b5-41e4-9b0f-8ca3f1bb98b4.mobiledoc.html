<p>All <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/custom/">custom</a> cars represent the vision and hard work of their builders, but every once in a while, there's something that makes wonder what people are thinking. That's why among all of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1965-shelby-gt350r-breaks-mustang-auction-record/">priceless, million-dollar classics</a> that were up for grabs at Mecum's Indy 2020 auction event last week, this custom double-headed creation managed to catch our eye as well as nearly $20,000 from its new owner.</p>

<p>This unique custom was a part of the Dallas and Ammie Hawkins Collection that included a handful of other unique offerings including a couple of Zimmers, a Stutz Blackhawk and some really cool <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/restomod/">restomods</a>.</p>
<p>That's definitely the case with this  that will be up for auction in July combining the front halves of a 1981 Dodge Colt and its identical sister car, the 1981 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/barn-find-1970-plymouth-cuda-roller-under-11k/">Plymouth </a>Champ – both based on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1994-mitsubishi-lancer-evolution-ii-gsr-lets-you-live-your-wrc-dreams/">Mitsubishi </a>Mirage hatchback.</p>
<p>This car was created by slicing two of these nearly identical three-door hatchbacks just behind the B-pillar and then welding both front ends together to create a four-door sedan. As wacky as it is, this double-header car looks well built with a symmetrical exterior, but the symmetry ends on the inside with a clever two-tone black and red interior; the engine compartments are also colored differently.</p>
<p>What you get is a two-faced subcompact that has a pair of driver's seats and four-wheel steering (individually controlled from two steering wheels), and both halves of the car feature an 80-horsepower, 1.6-liter engine that is able to operate independently from the other. Interestingly, each engine is paired to Mitsubishi's Twin Stick manual transmission that continues the two-sided theme by using a four-speed manual transmission and two-speed transfer case to return eight forward gears and two reverse gears.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell if this <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/SC0520-414571/1981-dodge-double-header-custom/">custom Dodge/Plymouth mashup</a> is coming or going, but it was auctioned off at no reserve and went to a new home  for $19,800.</p>
