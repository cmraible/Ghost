In comparison, a campaign-based approach is more tactical, and more geared to short-term business priorities (e.g. boost sales now!) than customer needs.\n\nTwitter has [featured the research](https://blog.twitter.com/en-gb/2014/always-on-brands-are-more-successful-on-twitter), too.\n\n\n## In good Company\n\n[*Company* magazine takes the well trod path to online-only](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/13/company-magazine-digital-only-print-edition):\n\n> Hearst announced on Wednesday that after Company’s final issue, October 2014, goes on sale on 5 September, it will focus its efforts on targeting 16-24 year old women via the title’s website, Company.co.uk.\n\nThe major concern? That the next well-trod path is to complete closure…\n\n\n## A bitter tablet to swallow\n\nTalking of digital magazines, one of the [pioneers of tablet magazine design has walked away](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034198/innovation-by-design/ipad-magazine-pioneer-lights-a-match-and-walks-away) from the market:\n\n> “From my experience in working with Fast Company and other magazines, if you put a digital magazine on an iPad and you hand the iPad to somebody, you have the opportunity to make them say wow. If you expect the same person to find that magazine, pay for that magazine, and download that mag, that’s asking for a lot!” he says. “But that’s what businesses can do, put an iPad in your hands at the points of sale or a meeting room, and get your [attention]. That’s the game changer here.”\n\nIronically, of course, most B2B magazine companies are still locked into dingy page-turning replicas on tablets.\n\n\n## The next wave of LinkedIn spam\n\nThe tidal wave of LinkedIn content is coming. And they’ve release [more details about their platform](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/08/14/linkedin-details-new-publishing-platform-distribution-feeds-notifications-pulse-emails/?utm_source=social&utm_campaign=pro&awesm=tnw.to_f4sFC&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_content=435):\n\n> LinkedIn today outlined on its engineering blog a series of recent technical updates to improve distribution for new posts on its publishing platform. The three improvements include integration with the Feed-Mixer algorithm for ranking posts in LinkedIn’s member feeds, mobile notifications for first-degree connections and inclusion in daily or weekly Pulse news emails.\n\nI still don’t have access to the publishing platform – but as my contacts start pushing our more and more spammy self-promotional content through it, I’m losing interest fast.\n\n\n## The pulse of Wikipedia\n\nFascinating account of [Wikipedia vandalism, correction and participation](https://medium.com/message/meet-the-woman-who-deleted-marissa-mayers-five-children-8ad8fab12ae3):\n\n> Now, notice: It had been eight minutes since the original wrong info had been posted, and three people had edited that sentence. But nobody had checked the facts and fixed the problem. This was the Reign of Error—the period during which I, and presumably dozens or hundreds or even thousands of other people, stumbled by and read the page. (It would be cool to have a long German word for this informational interregnum.)\n\nHe eventually finds the person who *did* do the correction…\n\n- - - - - -\n\n*Any suggestions out there of good articles we should read? Feel free to share ’em, old or new…*\n\n\n"
