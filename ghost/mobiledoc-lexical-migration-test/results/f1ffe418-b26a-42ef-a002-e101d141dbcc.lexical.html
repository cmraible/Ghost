<p>Sometimes, when you're really deep in a subject, it's easy to forget that something that is familiar and explicable to you can seem bewildering to someone who doesn't have to live and breathe, say, SEO. </p>
<p>For example, Marcela, the editor of journalism.co.uk, tweeted this out yesterday:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear editor,<br><br>I want you to advertise our product but you have to make it look like an article, add a dofollow link, don't mention it's sponsored and preferably I don't want to pay unless I have to, and then it's like £20.<br><br>No.</p>— Marcela Kunova (@MarcelaKunova) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcelaKunova/status/1376484012353589249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a>
    </blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure>
<p>And followed it up with this:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My reply (if I have time) goes like: we are a trusted publication for a reason and everything you're asking for is precisely not it (in a more civilised format).<br><br>But, I mean, anyone else? These requests proliferate, I'm just bewildered.</p>— Marcela Kunova (@MarcelaKunova) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcelaKunova/status/1376487953057333252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a>

<p>If you're not aware, this is all about SEO. Getting links from high quality sites to your own is still fundemental to ranking well in Google — and if you can't get good sites, volume of links will go some way to addressing that. And that leads to emails like the ones Marcela's been receiving.</p>
<h3 id="spray-and-pray-linkbuilding">Spray and pray linkbuilding</h3>
<p>As volume of links will do the job, many linkbuilders take a “spray and pray” approach to getting them. They build or buy an email list of website owners, and just send out a huge volume of emails, asking for links. Sometimes they offer to buy them. I get several every week.</p>
<p>Here's the exact wording from a recent one:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote>Hey,We're interested in purchasing a link insert on your website.We're happy to discuss terms that include:<ul>
        <li>Inserting a link onto your existing page of yours (as long as it's relevant piece of content, of course).</li>
        <li>Our link needs to be permanent & do-follow</li>
        <li>Our link can't be labelled 'sponsored' or 'guest-post' (or anything similar)</li>
    </ul>Please let us know your price. Serious buyer. Chat soon.</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>(That <em>faux</em> affable “chat soon” particularly irritates me…)</p>
<p>They <em>know</em> that the vast majority of receipents will say “no”, or just delete the email. But enough people will say “yes” to make it worth their while. If I agreed to all the offers that came my way, I could easily add a few hundred quid extra onto my monthly income. But it just wouldn't be worth the price I'd pay in traffic. Here's why.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>The give-away that this is SEO-related is the use of "dofollow". It's a piece of SEO jargon that essentially means “not nofollow”. “nofollow” is an attribute you can attach to a link to tell Google to ignore it. You use it whenever you want to link to a site but not be seen to be endorsing it. For example, if it's a scam site or a hate site, you'd use a nofollow link.</p>
<h3 id="beware-sponsored-content">Beware sponsored content</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago you'd use it to mark sponsored content, too, but that was replaced by <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links">rel=“sponsored” over a year ago</a>. The idea here is that an advertiser can buy traffic from your site, but it can't buy search ranking. A “nofollow” conveys no page ranking. A “sponsored” conveys a little — but not as much as a “dofollow” link. </p>
<p>The majority of these SEOs <em>do</em> want to buy page ranking and as much of it as possible — or, at the very least, to trade free content for page ranking. And the fact they're asking for an unqualified link makes it clear that they are, in SEO terms, up to no good. </p>
<p>This is a <em>terrible</em> deal for publishers, and you should always say “no”. If Google catches on to this particular link generation campaign, it will both penalise the site that bought the links <em>and</em> the site that hosted them. And yes, that means you, if you agreed to host the link. </p>
<h3 id="shutting-them-down">Shutting them down</h3>
<p>I have had some success with a copy/paste reply which says:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote>Hello,<br /> I'm not interested in participating in link-building schemes which violate Google's guidelines and which put my site's own search ranking at risk. </blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>I can't prove it, but it does seem to help reduce the frequency of these email. But in the end, you can ignore them, or you can reply telling them to take a hike — but you should never say “yes”. </p>
<p>Don't fall into this SEO trap.</p>

    <li>🔥 This is a <a href="https://defector.com/incoming-tnr-editor-lays-out-boring-vision-for-magazine-in-depressing-meeting-with-staff/">rather cutting take on a new editor</a>. There's a clear trend developing of staff who are not happy about an incoming editor making it know through both social media and other publications. I'm not sure this will have the same impact as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/media/teen-vogue-editor-alexi-mccammond.html"><em>Teen Vogue</em></a> story did, but still a trend worth watching. </li>
