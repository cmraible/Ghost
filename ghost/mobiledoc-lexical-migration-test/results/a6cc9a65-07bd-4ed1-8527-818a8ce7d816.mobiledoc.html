<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The big day is finally here — we have officially changed our name to <em>The Lever</em>, and we have launched our brand-new expanded website at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">LeverNews.com</a>. Go check it out (and please mark this email from <a href="mailto:editor@levernews.com">editor@levernews.com</a> as “not spam” in your email system).</p>
<p><strong>Then take advantage of our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/theleverlaunch">biggest discount ever</a> to become a supporting subscriber and access the whole site — it’s just than $4.50 for the first 50 people who use it.</strong></p>

<p>Also, please share the video on social media!</p>
<p>As part of our expansion, we are launching a new monthly virtual happy hour, where supporting subscribers will get to interact with our staff and ask them pressing questions. </p>
<p>Our first happy hour will be <strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/live-chat-our-new-monthly-happy-hour-2/">this Thursday 3/24 at 7 pm ET (4 pm PT)</a></strong>. Supporting subscribers will chat with <em>The Lever</em>’s reporters and editors about our expansion, we’ll get your input on our future coverage, and I’ll give you my fish-out-of-water take on what it’s like to be in Los Angeles right now in the lead-up to this weekend’s Academy Awards.</p>

<p>This expansion is the culmination of months of planning, and it could only happen because thousands of our free subscribers have pitched in and become supporting subscribers. In the coming weeks, <em>The Lever</em> will be announcing some new hires and columnists — <strong>and the launch of special new features for our supporting subscribers.</strong></p>
<p><em>The Lever’s</em> mission is straightforward:</p>
<p>We believe a functioning democracy requires a vibrant independent media and aggressive reporting, rather than corporate media promoting propaganda.</p>
<p>We believe fearless subscriber-supported journalism can create leverage that forces politicians and corporations to fulfill their promises.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Archimedes: We believe that with a strong enough lever, we can help move the world.</p>
<p>We can only build that lever with your help, so please — take a look at the new website and then <strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/theleverlaunch">use our biggest-ever discount</a></strong> to become part of our team.</p>

<p>With your help, we can build a new kind of media outlet — one that is supported by readers, and focused on holding the powerful accountable.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
