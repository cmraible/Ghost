<p>We're in the closing hours of 2019, so it's a good time to take stock, and look back on the posts that blew the doors off this blog during the year. It's been a good year — after suffering a decline over the last couple of years, I seem to have found my blogging mojo again, and my traffic has been dominated by recent posts, rather than some of the more evergreen archive posts (although the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2014/01/want_to_read_your_ipad_in_the_bath/">iPad/bath post</a> still performs…).</p>
<p>It's probably not a coincidence that the resurgence in this blog has come along with a renewed focus on what we're now calling <em>engaged journalism</em> or <em>audience engagement</em>. It's been my focus for a decade and a half in my working life now, well before the current terms were actually coined. And I intend to refine that focus ever-further in the new year. Handing over some of the "public notebook" aspects of this blog to <a href="https://microblog.onemanandhisblog.com">my micro.blog account</a> has freed me up to dive deeper on journalism-related issues here. And it's interesting to see both that it has clearly worked — and what really resonated with you lot. </p>
<p>I'll be honest: I would have predicted <em>most</em> of these, but a few are genuine surprises — including the one at number 10. </p>
<p>Here we go, in reverse order:</p>

<h3 id="10-filtering-my-pocket-gimbal">10. Filtering my pocket gimbal</h3>
<p>Video has become an increasingly important part of my work and training, not that it's been well-reflected on this blog (yet). But one of my go-to tools over the last year has been the <a href="https://amzn.to/2rNQRCM">Osmo Pocket</a>, a really handy and verstile little video camera. I was offered the chance to review some filters for it — and the resulting post has done very nicely from search traffic. </p>

<h3 id="9-mock-the-zuck">9. Mock the Zuck</h3>
<p>I try not to be as snarky on here as I used to be, but Mr Zuckerberg and his fatuous public statements are just too tempting a target. And, let'd be fair, it's the very definition of punching up. He can take it. His site is <em>younger</em> than this one, and yet has made him possibly the most powerful man in the world… </p>

<h3 id="8-for-members-get-ghost">8. For members get Ghost</h3>
<p>This one caught me on the hop. I wasn't sure there was still an appetite for CMS geekery on the web, but it turns out that there is — especially when it comes to audience engagement. I spoke to John, the co-founder of Ghost, about the new iteration of the product — and have started intergrating those features here. If you're reading this post in an email, for example, it's because of the new functionality that Ghost 3.0 enabled — and I intend to roll more of it out through the coming year. </p>

<h3 id="7-never-insult-corbyn-twitter">7. Never insult Corbyn Twitter</h3>
<p>Ah, the one post from this year I almost regret. I made a fairly anodyne post about one of the Corbyn-centric Twitter accounts that appeared to be indulging in wholesale blocking of journalists, and am still dealing with occasional drive-by attacks for the post months afterwards.</p>
<p>Luckily, the growing online toxicity is something I've largely experienced as an observer — but this actually brought me into the swamp. </p>

<h3 id="6-forever-hunting-business-models">6. Forever hunting business models</h3>
<p>Another surprise - this liveblogged post from a <em>news:rewired</em> event earlier in the year has done very nicely, and still periodically gets shared around. Symptomatic, I suspect, of how much work is still to be done on business models that will sustain journalism.</p>

<h3 id="5-momo-no-no">5. Momo No No</h3>
<p>This post was written in deep irritation. My daughters' school had just sent round a warning about this viral fake, thus helping prolong its existence. We're still failing basic fact checking as a culture, and seeing various bodies make serious warnings about a fairly obvious hoax was one of the major face-palm moments of the year. </p>

<h3 id="4-telling-the-story-of-the-climate-crisis">4. Telling the story of the climate crisis</h3>
<p>The final surprise in the list. Another liveblogged post, this time from one of the European Journalism Centre's News Impact Summit in Birmingham. This round-up of three different formats used to tell vital climate crisis stories was clearly inspiring enough to be shared, shared and shared again.</p>
<p>One of my 2020 resolutions is to attend more events like this, especially if the News Impact series restarts. </p>

<p>Who would have thought that giving a little context and gloss to a video would prove so popular? Certainly not me! And yet, this post — which is nothing more than that — continues to perform well. Another lesson learnt. </p>

<h3 id="1-goodbye-piers">1. Goodbye, Piers</h3>
<p>Astonishingly, the most popular post on my blog this year was only published just over a week ago. My former collegue Piers Jones passed away earlier this month, and it's a mark of the esteem he was help in at the various places he worked — RBI, <em>The Guardian, </em>Amazon and the Natural History Museum — that my small tribute to him has gone viral in that time. </p>
<p>If we can take any lesson from this, it's that we should take the time to celebrate the talented and the innovators around us while they're still with us — especially when they're lovely people, like Piers was.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to act on that in the coming year. </p>
