Some drivers behave like they’re invincible and that public roads are their private racetrack everyone else needs to vacate. So we weren’t the least bit surprised to see a Dodge Charger in the mix, even if we were disappointed."

The rear-facing camera on the passenger side picks up two cars traveling far quicker than everyone else on the right side of the highway as the street racers try avoiding the slower-moving vehicles."

Fortunately, the video says nobody was hurt in the accident."

That means the left lane isn’t something you just stay in all the time since it’s supposed to only be for overtaking slower drivers. You’ll notice though that the Tesla driver is in an HOV lane at the extreme left side of the freeway, so he and other drivers in that lane aren’t breaking the law. However, the cars in the next lane over, which is the left lane of regular traffic, could potentially have been cited for not using the lane properly."

They’ve probably gotten away with it quite a few times in the past so they didn’t think anything bad would happen. We hear this excuse from street racers all the time, that they’re not “rookie” drivers and they won’t crash… until they do."
