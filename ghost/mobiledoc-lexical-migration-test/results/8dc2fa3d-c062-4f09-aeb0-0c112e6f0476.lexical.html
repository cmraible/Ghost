<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We have heard consistent feedback from our readers that you want to act on our reporting and help make a difference. In response, we are today launching a new feature called Lever Actions — periodic suggestions for things you can do to advocate for change.</p>
<p>On a regular basis, we will send emails about hand-picked issues on which you can take an action. Sometimes these efforts will be sponsored by <em>The Lever</em>, while other times we will direct you to other organizations or networks taking action on a matter.</p>
<p>Our first Lever Action, shown below, is from our good friends at<em> The Intercept</em>.</p>

<p>From <em>The Intercept</em>:</p>
<blockquote>“As Americans across the nation witnessed the GOP’s brutal infighting during the recent election for speaker of the House of Representatives, one crucial press freedom issue became clear: <strong>We must grant C-SPAN full-time control of the cameras in the House.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>“Congressional proceedings are a matter of public record. The American people have a right to know what’s happening on the floor of Congress — and C-SPAN has shown they can protect that right when Congress won’t.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“<strong>Will you add your name now and tell House leadership to give C-SPAN’s independent, nonpartisan journalists control of the cameras on the House floor?</strong>”</blockquote>

<p>One reminder: We are a news outlet that focuses on accountability journalism so that readers can be informed about their government and society and take actions themselves. Unlike many corporate news outlets, we are transparent about our values and our point of view — and Lever Actions will reflect our stance. As an example, see our recent <a href="http://levernews.com/airlines">open letter on airline regulation</a>.</p>
<p>Just know we are not going to be alerting you to actions on every single issue under the sun. We will focus on actions related to the issues we cover.</p>
<p>If you don’t wish to receive Lever Action emails, but still want to receive our other emails, click “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of this email and make the appropriate selections on the resulting email preferences page.</p>
<p>Rock the boat.</p>
