<p>Unless you are proficient in the way of Lexus, the IS300 appears rather bland. As a styling exercise to stir the soul and engage the driver, the ‘baby Lexus’ provides all the charm of a budget laptop.</p>
<p>Usually driven by those who couldn’t care less about cars, the IS300 is therefore overlooked by those seeking foreign automotive power. However, this 2005 specimen from <a href="https://drivermotorsports.com/inventory/152/2005-lexus-is300?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Driver Motorsports</a> may change your perception.</p>

<p>While it could be argued that the <a href="https://drivermotorsports.com/inventory/152/2005-lexus-is300?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Lexus IS300</a> would only ever appeal to a limited audience –screaming of low market value versus high running and repair costs – we believe the vehicle’s time is coming. Especially in tuned form.</p>

<p>As enthusiasts continue to be priced out of German sedan ownership, and models akin to Toyota’s Supra spiral upwards on the value ladder, <a href="https://drivermotorsports.com/inventory/152/2005-lexus-is300?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this particular IS300</a> provides an intoxicating blend of both – because it’s masking some performance secrets. <br><br>The black Lexus may appear mostly stock from a quick glance at the exterior, but this machine is far from factory standard. Upon opening the hood, you’ll find a Toyota 2JZ-GTE powerplant lurks beneath, boasting a large top mount Borg Warner S366 Turbo.</p>

<p>The unit swap has been undertaken to perfection, leaving the engine bay clean and tidy. It honestly looks as though the car left the showroom in this form. <br><br>Completed using nothing but high-end parts, including the AEM Infinity ECU to ensure peak performance, this is an <a href="https://drivermotorsports.com/inventory/152/2005-lexus-is300?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">IS300 on steroids</a>. It drives with all the comfort of a Lexus when prowling around the city streets, yet pulls like a freight train under heavy acceleration.</p>

<p>Further performance aspects include an aftermarket cast exhaust manifold, wastegate and down pipe, alongside a custom aluminium intake and Koyo radiator. There’s also a CX Racing intercooler and JVC head unit for good measure. <br><br>So, should you quite fancy the idea of Supra performance with the practicality of a BMW sedan, then look no further.
