So it only seems fitting that it would be brought together with yet another foundational pillar of automotive madmen.</p>

<p>This particular car is a design drawn up by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yasiddesign/?hl=en">Al Yasid from Yasiddesign</a> (Instagram). It showcases the classic beauty and body design of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1985-ferrari-288-gto-auction/">Ferrari GTO</a> while adding something just a bit special. What is that special thing you ask? One of the most powerful productions V8s ever made, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-hellcat-crashed/">Hellcat</a>! </p>

<p>Imagine, if you will, the sound of a 707-hp beast tearing up the streets off in the distance. The rip roar and rumble of that V8 the howl of the tires being smeared on every surface that’ll take it. Then, all of a sudden, you realize that it's coming for you. That screaming from the supercharger ringing out through the world surrounding and enveloping you in the spirit of the animal that lurks. You look behind you to catch a glimpse expecting to see that iconic charger or challenger, and then you spot it. A virtual unicorn in the car community, the most coveted item in every collector's dreams, the Ferrari GTO. </p>

<p>Your heart races as the magical whip of speed zooms past you and for a split second you question the reality of your situation and settle down from that whiplash you just gave yourself to keep your eyes on the car. This heart-pounding, jaw-dropping, monster of a car has felt some blowback from the true Ferrari purists. However many argue that the whole point of owning a car is that you get to do whatever you want with it, and for Al Yasid his dream Ferrari is even more engaging and spectacular than the original. Ferraris were designed, built, crafted, and created by artists. Brave men and women who pushed the boundaries of what a car should be. It is only fitting that this GTO’s legacy is fulfilled by yet another artist, even if they're a couple of decades apart.</p>
