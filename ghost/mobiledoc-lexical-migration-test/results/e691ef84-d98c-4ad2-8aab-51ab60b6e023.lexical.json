It's clear that significant changes are about to hit the world of social media, and we are looking toward a seemingly bright future as censorship continues to be reduced. However, another piece of information has Tesla fans in a bit of a bind, as owning an electric car has become even more expensive. All of this is to say that there have been some developments in how Tesla does business and loyal patrons of the brand are pretty confused. So what is this change that has everyone so worked up?",

Gas-powered cars don't come with their own gas pump because it would cost too much money, and the infrastructure is already established, so it wouldn't seem necessary. That's essentially what Tesla is doing, even if it seems premature.",
