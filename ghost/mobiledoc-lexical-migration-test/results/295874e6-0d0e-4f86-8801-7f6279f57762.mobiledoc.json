Knowing that Ford needed something special that would help the company bounce back after a difficult stretch during the 1950s, the idea for the Mustang was born. After holding a heated contest with Ford's designers, Iacocca personally picked a sketch by Gale Halderman, one of the Mustang designers that worked under Oros. Some credit Halderman as the sole designer of the Mustang as his sketch is very close to the original production Mustang."

From 1987 through 1993, the Fox-body featured aerodynamic composite headlamps with a different front fascia."

This new Mustang is widely referred to as the \"SN-95\", an updated version of Fox platform it now sat upon. Introduced in November 1993, the car officially went on sale on December 9th. The Mustang said goodbye to a boxy body and hello to a more futuristic look with curves. Hatchbacks and notchback versions were no longer available, but the convertible returned. The fourth-generation can also be split into two segments with the 1999 through 2004 model years featuring an updated body style known as the \"New Edge\"."

The new design was a success as Ford sold over 300,000 in the first two years. Produced through the 2005 through 2014, the fifth-generation Mustang sat on an all-new platform called the S-197. In 2010, the car was given a fresh facelift. In the 2011+ model years, the car featured the modular 5.0-liter Coyote V8 (Gen 1) as an engine option instead of the three-valve 4.6-liter that powered the SN-95 GT models and the earlier S-197s."

This joined the lineup next to the Coyote V8 and six-cylinder engine options, although the V6 was ultimately dropped as an option starting with the 2018 Mustang model."

Even more mind-blowing is the fact that Ford just revealed a racing version of the Mach-E that is capable of 1,400-horsepower. Plans for the prototype vehicle are to prove that performance powerhouses can be made out of all-electric vehicles, and that they can - in fact - boogie. With that said, the Blue Oval plans to invest over $11.5 billion in electric vehicles across the globe (including the Mach-E) through 2022. We can't wait to see what Ford has in mind for the Blue Oval involving electric cars."
