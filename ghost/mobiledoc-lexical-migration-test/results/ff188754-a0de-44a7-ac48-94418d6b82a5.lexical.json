All the character and monster profiles shown in the cards are clean and the game has a wide representation of monster variety, becoming more detailed the further into the dungeon you go. It has a distinctive art style that captures a strong feel for the game’s tone and with each of the cards feeling unique, I was definitely pleased with the direction they took here. The only missed opportunity I could determine was that the upgraded cards are the exact same and don’t have any changes to them visually.",

Every attack in combat carries weight that is emphasised by the added sounds and the footsteps that play when moving in the dungeon adds an extra layer of enjoyment.",
