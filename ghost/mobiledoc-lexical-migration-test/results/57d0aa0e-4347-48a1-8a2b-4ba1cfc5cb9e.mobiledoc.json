An air-to-water intercooler system, upgraded fuel injectors and pump, high-flow air induction system, and dyno calibration help push output to a scorching 808-bhp at 7,200 rpm. Torque is also up dramatically at 677 lb.-ft. at 4,500 rpm, ensuring you get some nice launches and can keep pulling hard down the track."

With that kind of acceleration and speed, stability is always a concern. That’s where the CarbonAero rear spoiler with gurney lip, CarbonAero front splitter, CarbonAero side sills, plus a lowered suspension come into play. Those black 20-inch alloy wheels are wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 tires which can handle the extreme performance of a car this caliber."
