If you absolutely have to have a first-year, mid-engine C8, then this one is still like new, and it will definitely have you singing Little Red Corvette."

Not only was this Corvette just produced in June, it only has 18 miles showing on the odometer! What really helps this Stingray stand apart is the optional wheels (19 inches up front and 20 inches at the rear) and the dealer-installed high-wing rear spoiler."
