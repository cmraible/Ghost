<p>It’s finally here! The true official announcement for Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu and Pokemon Let’s Go Eevee releasing November 16, 2018.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer that we were given…</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! Trailer" width="900" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jRtpMKLsts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack in that trailer, but it’s interesting to see that the catching mechanic from Pokemon Go is in the game. As promised, there seems to be a lot of connectivity with Pokemon Go, which may bring a lot of people back to the mobile game.</p>
<p>It also seems that the rumors about returning to Kanto were true, as we see Professor Oak and many more hints in the trailer.</p>
<p>But if this doesn’t do it for you, then the Pokemon company also announced that ANOTHER core Pokemon RPG will be releasing in 2019.</p>
