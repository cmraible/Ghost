The iconic teardrop 911 silhouette is present and correct, and while the 996 generation often splits opinion, the GT3 treatment serves to add some aggression. Wielding a substantial rear wing, this modern classic is still a serious supercar."

          "Today’s GT3’s really emphasize their motorsport DNA with many receiving bucket seats and race-inspired steering wheels, however, the 996 GT3 takes a more subtle approach. There’s some contrasting stitching, bolstered leather seats, and an Alcantara steering wheel, but generally speaking, the cabin is regular 911 — no bad thing. Of course there’s no rear seats, but that only serves to boost the car’s surprisingly generous trunk."

Its rear-wheel drive, rear-engine, manual transmission configuration, makes for a thrilling drive that serves to challenge the driver when pushing hard. According to the description, this example has never been over revved and has covered just over 21,500 miles from new."
