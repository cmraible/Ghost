          "According to a press released sent out by Motor Sports NewsWire, for the second consecutive year, the Chevy and Ford full size pickup trucks are the most stolen vehicles on the road in America. This data comes from the National Insurance Crime Bureau’s (NICB) annual Hot Wheels vehicle theft report. The full size GMC pickup trucks also made the top 10 cut, which means pickup truck owner really need to take caution; the Dodge Charger and Challenger didn’t even make the list!"

          "“Crime is a business, and business is good,” said David Glawe, President and CEO of NICB. “Used car values are at historical highs. We have seen a nearly 35% increase in used car values over the last two years due to supply chain issues and inflation. Stolen cars can be shipped overseas and resold or broken down for valuable used car parts here in the U.S.”"

A lot of the other vehicles seem to be those have been historically high-production, so it’s not curious that the list isn’t full of ‘cool’ cars’ either."

          "We’ve reported before that a high number of vehicle thefts happened when the keys were in a car, which could also explain why trucks are an easy target since many leave them running when on worksites, or leave the keys in them so they can easily be moved by another crew member. They’re also loaded with chips, so that might be another explanation. Here's the full list:"
