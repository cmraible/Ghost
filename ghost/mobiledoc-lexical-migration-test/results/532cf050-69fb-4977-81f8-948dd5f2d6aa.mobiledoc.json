          "It seems lately quite a few people are finding secret cars stashed away in their parents’ or grandparents’ garage. This time it’s Albert Antonacci who uncovered a rare 1979 Porsche 928 in Walton, New York. While cleaning out his late father Umberto’s garage, the man uncovered the classic sports car. Now, most people would rightfully get super worked up over a classic Porsche 911, but a 928 not so much. However, this car supposedly is a rare spec, so Albert feels pretty lucky."

Not surprisingly, the mechanic couldn’t make sense of what was under the hood, which is just hilarious. Also, the mechanic told Albert the Porsche is a rare spec with only about 400 made. We can’t confirm that since we don’t know the spec, but if true it might be worth more than your average ’79 928."

The man was an automotive enthusiast and grew up in Italy before moving to the United States with his parents and siblings for greater economic opportunities. The man seemed to appreciate what we had, even if others owned nicer cars."
