<p>Car thieves have been hitting dealerships hard in some areas for the past few years. Recently, at least three of them targeted Thiel Motor Sales of DeWitt in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/iowa-entrepreneur-lawsuit/">Iowa</a>, making off with a 1991 GMC Jimmy and a 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle. Unfortunately, the Chevelle had been purchased by a customer who was going to present the muscle car as a present for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/what-dad-really-wants-for-fathers-day/">Father’s Day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Check out a monster 1971 Ford Maverick <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/from-economy-car-to-speed-demon-jimmy-shaws-1971-ford-maverick-transformation/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Both vehicles were stolen at about 1 am on June 20. The dealer says both were likely hotwired and had to get fuel almost immediately.</p>

<p>Since thieves will often try transporting stolen vehicles like these two somewhere else, we’d like everyone to keep an eye peeled for them both. Also, take a good look at the surveillance footage stills Thiel Motor Sales shared, particularly the fact one guy is wearing the Michael Keaton Batman symbol on his shirt. What a loser.</p>
<p>We would think the thieves might feel bad if they see this story and learn how they ruined the holiday, but we know people who steal other’s property typically only care about themselves. It’s sad, really, and what’s even sadder are those who try to excuse criminals targeting businesses since supposedly that doesn’t hurt anyone.</p>

<p>Last we checked, businesses were owned by people and they employ people. If people steal enough from businesses they have to close down or at least trim back on costs, which could mean layoffs. But yeah, a victimless crime.</p>
<p>While insurance might cover some theft, coverage always has its limits. For those who want to justify stealing it’s always convenient to believe there’s some endless reservoir of money to back the victims up.</p>
<p>If you know anything about these stolen vehicles or the losers who took them, contact police in DeWitt, Iowa.</p>
