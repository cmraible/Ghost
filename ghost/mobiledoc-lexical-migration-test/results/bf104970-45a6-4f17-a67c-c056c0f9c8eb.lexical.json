That was my first reaction with <em>Steamdolls &#8211; Order of Chaos</em> as I looked upon the game&#8217;s stunning and unique neo-steampunk setting. One commendable aspect is <em>Steamdolls</em> has to be its immaculate lighting effects that gives its world a sense of eeriness. Not only that, but the original voice actor for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>&#8216;s Solid Snake David Hayter will also be voicing the protagonist, which is all kind of amazing. <em>Steamdolls &#8211; Order of Chaos</em> is a game on my, and hopefully many more&#8217;s, radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Steamdolls &#8211; Order of Chaos</em>&nbsp;required £30,000 and it is currently sitting at £48,190 after 696 backers with 25 days remaining. Considering that this project has already reached its initial goal, we then look toward its Stretch Goals. The next goal is aiming for £52,000 with more <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> voice talent.
