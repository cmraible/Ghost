Personally, I was a huge fan of SHIFT, but it could be my bias towards manual transmission culture. If you’re just starting to get into red wines, I think this is a great newbie blend, but I definitely recommend moving onto THE 24 from there. Red wine drinkers will love the full line right away, and appreciate the many levels of depth in the series."

I've known Kevin Buckler for a long time and have watched him grow Adobe Road and enjoy helping him out (and enjoy the wine),” she shared, continuing, “I think the fact that you can be in your own home/space and not have to listen to the whole thing if you don't want to (without embarrassing yourself or the \"host\") like you would probably feel if you went to a personal wine tasting. Plus when you're at the actual tasting room at some wineries they aren't that helpful/they just try to sell you something.”"
