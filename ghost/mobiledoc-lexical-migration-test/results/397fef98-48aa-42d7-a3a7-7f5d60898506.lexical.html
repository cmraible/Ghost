<p>The 1970 ‘Evolution’ Dodge Charger is a $400,000 build, constructed on commission for an unidentified customer. The body was crafted by SpeedKore entirely out of carbon fiber, except for the steel floor panel, and custom billet grille and door handles. The frame has been custom-built in-house from sturdy 2-inch by 3-inch box sections. The heart and soul, as aforementioned, is a drivetrain that was taken out of a late-model Dodge Challenger Demon. The engine isn’t even a stock Hellcat Hemi, though; it’s been upgraded to deliver as much as 966 horses at the wheel! You heard that right. This bad boy nearly puts out 1,000 horsepower. This vehicle also uses Penske double-adjustable coilover shock suspension instead of Mopar’s historic torsion bars. While the car itself may not be an original condition ’70 Charger, it certainly looks the part.</p>
<p>SpeedKore’s ‘<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2019-ultima-evolution-rs/">Evolution</a>’ Dodge Charger is big and bad, and looks like it could win a street race while merely at a standstill.</p>
