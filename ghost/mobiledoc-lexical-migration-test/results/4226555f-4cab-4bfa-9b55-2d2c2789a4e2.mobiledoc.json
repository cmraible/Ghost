          "First up is the engine, under the hood of this wicked orange demon is the famous Mopar 440ci V8. This engine was pushing somewhere in the realm of 390 horsepower brand new. Needless to say, this was an incredible amount in 1969 when the car was built. However, this was not good enough for the current owner and he rebuilt the old 440 and upgraded the camshaft. What was once a 390 horsepower engine is now an absolute powerhouse that rips the back tires with the force of 500 ponies!"

All of that horsepower is made usable with the help of a fully revamped suspension. Some of the aforementioned suspension modifications include a new front suspension courtesy of Firm Feel, stiffeners, and a rear sway bar from Hotchkis Suspension."
