<hr>
<p>The classic car market has changed over the past decade or so. <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1966-shelby-mustang-hertz-gt350h-8/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Classics that were</a> not original used to be frowned upon. At very least, a restoration had to appear original to be coveted, but now it's more about creating something unique and less about returning a car to its former glory. Every now and then though, the classic <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1966-shelby-mustang-hertz-gt350h-8/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">automotive</a> community is blessed with a sighting of a restoration that is done right.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1966-shelby-mustang-hertz-gt350h-8/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1966 Shelby Mustang GT350H</a> is up for bids on Bring A Trailer. The car’s history is as good as it gets for a 54 year old car. The one of a thousand Hertz edition has <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1966-shelby-mustang-hertz-gt350h-8/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">only had three owners in its lif</a>e and appears to have been restored to its original form by the second owner. The restoration included paint and body work as well as a complete rebuild of the numbers-matching 289 cubic-inch HiPo V8 engine. The black vinyl interior was refreshed and the suspension and braking systems have been rebuilt as well.</p>
