It honestly feels like something one could buy from a royalty-free site. As far as the sound design goes, the sounds of the ship engines and energy weapon fire are convincing enough. However, the voice acting isn’t great at all. Your pilot will often react to the situation, growling when hit by enemy fire, commenting on the quality of the take off from a port (arbitrarily since you have no control over that), and so on. The actor doesn’t do a great job and I find his commentary more of a hindrance on the immersion than it assists it. ",
