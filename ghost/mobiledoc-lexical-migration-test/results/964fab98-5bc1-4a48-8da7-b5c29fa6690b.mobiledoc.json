That will all change with this 35,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art museum that will be open to the public. From the outside, The Brumos Collection building is designed to pay homage to the look of the former Ford Model T plant located in downtown Jacksonville, while the inside will offer everything from a 22-seat movie theater to a an archive room to research automotive and racing history. More than just a museum, though, this facility will have a fully functional engine room, machine shop and dyno for vehicle repairs and restorations."
