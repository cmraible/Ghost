The cops would of course deny having anything really interesting on their cruisers, but so many people just knew they were lying. Now in the day and age of the internet, everyone knows the secret tool for pursuits the police use is the radio and helicopters. But there are still some cop cars with serious balls, like the Dodge Charger Pursuit, even if it can’t hold a candle to the Hellcat."

The best part of it is how they drift the Dodge Charger Pursuit around the closed track, plus do some pretty smokey burnouts. Usually you don’t see a cop car doing anything of the sort, so it’s quite the sight."

Before you laugh and loudly declare there are no winter driving conditions in California, know that Truckee isn’t too far from Lake Tahoe. High in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, there’s a pretty healthy amount of snowfall there each winter, so the reminder is quite necessary."

Your car won’t handle the same, braking distances are increased, etc. It’s also an excellent idea to invest in some winter tires mounted to another set of wheels, even if you own an all-wheel or four-wheel-drive vehicle."
