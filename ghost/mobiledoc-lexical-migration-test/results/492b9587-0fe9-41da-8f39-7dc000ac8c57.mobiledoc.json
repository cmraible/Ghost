Despite the fact that that's sort of dismal to come out of such a large engine, the vehicle was regarded as sort of a death trap for any driver willing to get behind the wheel.

However, the fourth generation became one of the most iconic cars to ever come out of any American automotive company. It was faster, quicker shifting, and featured a more impactful performance-based style which made it very sought after for any automotive enthusiast with a taste for speed. Finally, we have the fifth generation, the ultimate vehicle to connect all of these intense supercars with an 8.4-liter V10 with 650 horsepower and all of the fun Dodge marketing troupes it could handle backing it up.
