<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-tyler-hoover-start-a-barn-find-camaro/">Tyler Hoover</a> is the first to admit his YouTube channel <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-is-what-a-cheap-lamborghini-costs-to-fix/">Hoovies Garage</a> is the dumbest car collection in the world. The guy regularly buys the cheapest version of all kinds of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-buys-maserati-quattroporte-salvage-title-at-auction/">exotic or ultra-luxurious cars</a> and then sees just how many problems he inherits, which is usually a long list. So, it only makes sense that a guy who likes to maintain a fleet of hoopties has also acquired a 1951 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-ford-country-squire-wagon/">Ford Country Squire</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not meant to be a dig on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/happy-birthday-ford-mustang/">Fords</a>, but surely some people will take it as such anyway. However, if you’re looking for a reliable, low-maintenance classic, this surely isn’t the car for you. Really, any true <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/behold-the-motherload-of-woodies/">woodie</a> shouldn’t be in your garage, because when you use the stuff trees are made of for car body panels, a whole array of problems can arise. There are many good reasons woodies haven’t been made in a long time. It pains us to admit this since we absolutely love woodies, but it’s true and there’s just no use hiding it.</p>
<p>For Hoovies Garage, a classic car is an anomaly, so this episode is definitely unique. By Hoover says to own this car is a like a dream come true, a dream many of us share but few get to attain. It’s a good thing he got it, because when he found the car it was about to be chopped up by a shop in Minnesota to make into a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tyler-hoover-sings-praises-for-restomods/">restomod</a>. That would’ve been a shame.</p>
<p>This car had been sitting in a museum for years, so that’s why it looks so good. And while the tires are dry rotting, the engine apparently purrs like a kitten. The plan Hoover has is to take some new tires in the back to a shop and have them installed, then drive this classic Ford to his mechanic. But, as you’ve probably guessed, that doesn’t turn out so well, only the tragedy happens sooner than you’re likely thinking.</p>
