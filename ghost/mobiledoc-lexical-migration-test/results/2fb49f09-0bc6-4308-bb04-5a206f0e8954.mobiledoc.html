<p>A recent story about a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-accident/">flawless Mustang Mach 1</a> being destroyed during a car hauler accident had us wondering how many other dream cars have met a similar fate - the answer is not pretty! While some of the stories are still fresh on our mind from previous Motorious coverage, come to find out, collectible cars are often victims of transporting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/someone-just-wrecked-a-ferrari-f40/">accidents</a>. Here are some of the worst accidents that occurred during transportation. </p>

<p>This story has a major twist that comes with it! Not only were a few really cool cars burnt to a crisp, a reader of a local ABC news site recognized these cars as ones involved in a race car building series. At least four of the cars involved were on their way to South <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-accident/">Georgia</a> to race for a filmed online series, but a fire stopped this leg of the trip in New Mexico.</p>

<p>When these 2017 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-chevrolet-corvette-instant-collectible/">Corvettes were still brand new</a>, they had an unfortunate encounter on the interstate with a semi. This accident drudges up feelings of road rage when you see two semis playing turtle racing to pass each other, slowly, on interstates and highways while taking up two lanes. Still, the Corvettes did nothing wrong here, and this is a hard one to look at.</p>

<p>This newly purchased Mach 1 was miles away from its new owner in Dawsonville, GA <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-accident/">when it was demolished</a>. The photos from the accident painted a bizarre story, with no official statement being made (yet, it just happened) about the cause of the accident. All we know if the buyer arranged the transportation, and the Mach 1 was a car anyone would have wanted in their garage. </p>

<p>The original thread on this accident has long since been taken down, so we'll have to just take <a href="https://bangshift.com/general-news/horror-story-man-escapes-death-in-horrible-wreck-while-towing-69-camaro-pace-car-home/">BangShift.com's</a> word on this one.

This doesn't exactly look like a professional outfit, and we don't have many details, so we'll leave the cause of this accident up to your wild speculation in the comments.</p>

<p>Newley purchased, this classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1969-dodge-charger-trio/">Dodge Charger</a> was in an enclosed, single car trailer when a semi truck hit the trailer. This factory FM3 Charger 500 ended up getting no protection from the aluminum sided trailer, but hopefully there was enough to salvage to make this Charger whole again.</p>

<p>Luigi Capilupi was waiting for the delivery of his 1977 Corvette, when the day it was supposed to arrive came with a different type of surprise. His son, Antonio, caught wind of a car hauler wreck in New Jersey, and was able to confirm the story, and the blue 'Vette was identified in a photo accompanying a news article. While the Corvette itself made it through virtually unscathed, the story was just too bizarre to leave out of this article.</p>
