<p>From the outside, this car nailed the looks of Steve McQueen's hero car starting with a Mustang 2+2 fastback painted in Dark Highland Green with five-spoke American Racing wheels and all the factory badging removed. The listing says that this car has had a "Bullitt package" professionally installed, which appears to be limited to floor mats and some chrome exterior "Bullitt" logos. The coolest part of this replica is that it even comes with a California black license plate with the same "JJZ109" plate number from the movie car!</p>
<p>Even under the hood, this Mustang packs the same "S" code 390 CID V8 that the <em>Bullitt</em> hero car used, but instead of a four-speed manual, this restored replica uses an automatic transmission. The lack of a cue ball shifter might be the biggest omission from this Mustang compared to the original movie car, but it does come with full-length center console for a sportier interior. Despite these minor inconsistencies, this car's interior is still almost identical to the original Bullitt Mustang including the wood grain interior and the three-spoke Cobra-badged steering wheel.</p>
