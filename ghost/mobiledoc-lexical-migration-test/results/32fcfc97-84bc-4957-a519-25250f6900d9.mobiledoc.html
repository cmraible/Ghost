<p>“This car, this is a car I always wanted to get, “ Grover said. ”And since I was a kid, I've been looking to get a 1967 Mustang.”</p>

<p>When he was 18, he bought a bright yellow 1967 Ford Mustang.</p>
<p>“In college I was staying with my grandpa, so this was in Tallahassee, Florida. He is an antique car collector through and through," Grover said. "And I wanted to learn the skill of restoring [and] working on an old car. And grandpa and I, we spent bout five months looking for a 1967 mustang and we found one, and it cost me about $2,000 in 2005 to buy this car.”</p>

<p>The theft was caught on surveillance. A white Malibu rolled up on the car, next to the street where the Mustang was in a parking lot, and the crooks spent almost 30 minutes hot wiring the car before taking off with it.</p>
<p>Josh’s thoughts quickly shifted to how to tell his grandfather the Mustang they had worked on together is now gone. His grandfather offered to get him another Mustang so he can ‘do it all over again’, but without his grandfather’s help this time, and that’s not what Josh wants.</p>
<p>“You can buy a 1967 mustang in that condition somewhere else, but not that car," he said. "Not the one that I turned all those bolts, I swapped just about every part out you possibly could, it’s just disappointing to see it gone.</p>

<p>‘My grandpa is definitely much older than he was when I was living with him in college, so he’s 84," Grover said. “So if I were to find the car 20 years from now and it was rusted and gone to trash, I would still want that car, and I would restore it back again, because I want those memories back.”</p>
