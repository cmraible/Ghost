<p>Classic cars are intriguing things to look at, but often at big shows you’ll find several versions of the same model — not ideal if your aim is to stand out from the crowd. Resto-mod cars are more popular than ever, giving enthusiasts the opportunity to own something totally bespoke. This 1942 Chevrolet Aerosedan is a prime example of a modified classic that will turn heads.</p>
<p>Currently for sale with <a href="https://www.lostandfoundclassiccarco.com/vehicles/111/1942-chevrolet-aero-sedan-custom" rel="noopener">Lost and Found Classic Car Co</a>, the resto-mod machine in question is based on Chevy’s Fleetline Aerosadan. The two-door fastback model featured some distinctive  styling that has been amplified during this metamorphosis. The car has been chopped, smoothed, and Frenched to very high standards, creating a beautifully sculptural machine in the process. If you’re a fan of Artdeco design, this one is for you.</p>

<p>The interior has been drastically overhauled and is far more akin to a modern car than a classic. A touchscreen infotainment system is now at the center of the dashboard with other gizmos such as  power seats, power windows, and a USB socket joining the roster. The cabin is lined with grey leather and other plush materials to give a more cosseting feeling to the passenger space.</p>
<p>Underneath that proud hood is a 350 cubic-inch V8 engine that’s sure to deliver the appropriate performance for such a unique car. A Turbo 350 automatic transmission and power steering should make cruising to an event effortless, while independent front suspension and disc brakes boost the abilities of this chassis.</p>
