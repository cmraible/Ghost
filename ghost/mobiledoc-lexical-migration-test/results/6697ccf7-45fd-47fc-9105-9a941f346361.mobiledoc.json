There’s a growing body of evidence that, for all her skill as a print journalist, and undoubted charisma, she just can’t cut it as a stage interviewer. And if there’s one thing the social media world can’t abide, it’s old media journalists giving themselves airs above their skill level.</div><div>  \n</div><div>If there’s a lesson here, it’s as simple as “stick to what you’re good at”.<div>  \n</div></div>\n"
