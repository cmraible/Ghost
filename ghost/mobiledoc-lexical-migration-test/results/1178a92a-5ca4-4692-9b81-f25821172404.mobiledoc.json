The video isn’t mocking user generated content in general, just that slightly cheesy way TV and radio solicits user feedback to give them a thin patina of interaction, which is wholly fake. Compare the “reckons” on TV to the debates found in blog comments or forums, and you’ll see how shallow these efforts really are.\n\nI hereby coin the phrase “cargo-cult engagement” to describe this phenomenon. My licensing rates are very reasonable…\n\n\n"
