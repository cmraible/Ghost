<p><strong>8. DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8A. Arbitration.</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY because it affects rights that you might otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court proceedings.</p>
<p>Arbitration is different from court. There is no judge or jury, but the arbitrator can award damages. Arbitration is final, biding, and subject to only limited review by a court. <strong>You agree to give up your right to a trial in court</strong> except for certain small claims as described below. You agree that this arbitration section shall survive termination of these Terms. This section shall be broadly interpreted to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms. Any dispute or claim made by you against Company or against any of our subsidiaries, parents, or affiliated companies arising out of these Terms, whether based on contract, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, tort, or any other legal theory, will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that you may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such court.</p>
<p>You must first present any claim or dispute to Company by emailing a complete description of the basis for the claim or dispute to <a href="mailto:Legal@speeddigital.com">Legal@speeddigital.com</a>. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within sixty (60) days of you emailing the basis to us.</p>
<p>The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of a nationwide arbitration organization, as modified in these Terms. Any arbitration will be conducted in Charlotte, North Carolina. An arbitrator may not (i) award relief in excess of or contrary to what these Terms provide; (ii) order consolidation or arbitration on a class-wide or representative basis, or (iii) award punitive damages or any other damages aside from the prevailing party’s actual damages, except that the arbitrator may award damages that any statute deems unwaivable and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to an applicable consumer protection statute.</p>
<p>The decisions of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties involved, and any judgment or decision on an arbitration may be entered in and specifically enforced in any court having proper jurisdiction. If any portion of this section is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall be given full force and effect. Unless an applicable statute expressly permits awarding attorney’s fees to the prevailing party, all administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided equally between you and Company. Each party will bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, facility fees, and preparation and presentation of evidence at any arbitration hearing.</p>
<p><strong>8B. Severability.</strong></p>
<p>If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>8C. Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies.</strong></p>
<p>Company and you agree that any controversy excluded from the arbitration procedure and class action waiver provisions, shall be filed only in the state courts of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, or in the federal courts of the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina-Charlotte Division, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.</p>
<p><strong>9. INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9A. Indemnification.</strong></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Company, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers harmless from and against any claim, action, demand, loss, suit, or damages (including attorneys' fees) made or incurred by any third party arising out of or relating to your improper use of the Site, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of a third party. This indemnification is from and against any and all losses, liability, damages, causes of action, claims, demands, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees, paralegal’s fees and expert’s fees), whether incurred at the pre-arbitration, arbitration, the pre-trial, trial or appellate levels of litigation, or otherwise, in connection with (i) any breach of this agreement by you or anyone claiming through you or because of you. Company shall always retain choice of counsel.</p>
