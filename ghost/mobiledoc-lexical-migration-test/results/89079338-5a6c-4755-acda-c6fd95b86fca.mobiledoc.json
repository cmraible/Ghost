After all, it was Toyota which figured out the magic formula for making hybrids accessible to the masses, pushing electrification more than any other automaker. And while it endured a lot of heat for flooding roads with countless Prius drivers, that technology has matured to the point where there’s a hybrid version of just about every Toyota model line at this point (the Tundra, Sequoia, Land Cruiser, 4Runner, and Tacoma being the exceptions for now). That doesn’t mean Toyota is above criticism or scrutiny, but accusing the automaker of being against technological progress is hardly fair. After all, Toyota spends a ridiculous amount on research and development, so it’s not exactly interested in just sitting still."

While both companies were fairly mum on the reasons for ending the arrangement, some have speculated Toyota saw something it didn’t like in Tesla or maybe in EV technology in general. Known for being fiscally conservative while Tesla isn’t in the least, it could have been just that. Whatever the reason, Toyota has been increasingly critical of purely electric vehicles."
