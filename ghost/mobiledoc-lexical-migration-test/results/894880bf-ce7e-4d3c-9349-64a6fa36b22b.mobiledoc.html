<p>Back in 1964, Cadillac was in the process of toning down their bold body designs, or at least they were trying. With sharp lines spanning from nose to rear and flamboyant tail fins on its flanks, there is nothing dull about this <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/1585-nsh/1964-cadillac-series-62-coupe-ls-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1964 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe</a>. The good news is that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Streetside+Classics">Streetside Classics</a> is excited to find this sweet Caddy a new loving home.</p>

<p>Applied recently, an Ebony paint job makes this classic shine like a diamond. Chrome accents add even more flare to the outside which includes the huge front and rear bumpers, elaborate front grille, and a long trim piece along both sides that break up the black paint. A set of 22-inch Boyd Coddington wheels are wrapped with performance radials (265/35/22).</p>
<p>Powering this vintage Caddy coupe is a 5.3-liter LS V8 Vortec V8 engine fed by fuel injection. The car was LS-swapped about 500 miles ago, and only 18,000 miles total have accumulated on the block. Equipped with a Mutha Thumpr camshaft and Stage 1 fuel injection, this big classic roars to life under throttle. Other highlights include a cold air intake, a clean induction system, bright-colored valve covers, and an aluminum radiator with an electric fan. Power is shifted down to the wheels thanks to a 4L60E automatic transmission with overdrive. Added rumble comes from a Flowmaster dual exhaust, and a heavy-duty suspension keeps handling in check. Navigating comes easy thanks to power steering and front power disc brakes.</p>

<p>A restored tuxedo-like interior features black and white leather that shows only minor signs of wear, and it retains most of its original configuration. Spanning the rear is a large bench seat with ample leg room for your family or friends. Power windows come down with the push of a button, and vital engine signs are monitored via the triple set of auxiliary gauges. The Pioneer head unit booms your favorite tunes through upgraded speakers and tweeters placed throughout the cabin, and a big Kicker subwoofer in the trunk. The factory air conditioning has been converted to take R134a refrigerant, but it does need a service.</p>
