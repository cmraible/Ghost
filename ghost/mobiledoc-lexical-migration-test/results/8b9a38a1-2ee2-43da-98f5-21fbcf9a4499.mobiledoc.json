          ", this limo is amazing for one simple reason: it’s a convertible. Sure, you might be able to find a topless limousine here and there, but you have to admit they’re rare things. Why is that? Well, first of all most of the country is subject to some fairly crappy weather a good portion of the year. This limousine was used in Las Vegas, which if you’re not aware has pretty mild weather. Unlike Seattle, it’s not always raining. Unlike Detroit, it’s not as cold as a woman who learns her date is arriving in a Hyundai Sonata. "

Maybe you like thick and chunky, but some people are into sleek and athletic, and the Viper certainly falls into that category. To be fair, a Corvette limo would as well, but this article is about this real Viper limousine. It just looks more exciting than the other stretch limos you usually see."

Well, you’re going to have to keep imagining, because even though this one-of-a-kind limo was just for sale on eBay, bidding has ended with nobody placing a bid. That might have been because the starting bid amount was $135,000. I can’t imagine why anyone wouldn’t gladly shell out 10 times that to own such a thing."
