          "The C3 Corvette is one of America’s favorite cars, with classic 80’s styling, insane handling for its time, and a propensity for dominating on track days it's very clear why this fascination exists. However, being a car made over 40 years ago, yesterday's high performance is barely able to keep up with modern technology. The obvious solution is to recreate the old car with modern-day tech. Of course, if you're going to restomod then you might as well do it with parts from the best version of your favorite car, that's exactly the concept behind this glorious Corvette."

          "If this violent ‘Vette is coming for you, you’ll hear it but you won't see it. This is because under the hood of this sporty American restomod is a 6.2-liter LS3 V8 engine that pushes which is mated to a 6L80 automatic transmission equipped with a paddle shifter. That powerhouse sits on top of a custom-built frame and a C6 Corvette transaxle. All of the steering parts have been transferred over from a C6 Corvette and the brakes come from C6 Z06 Which gives this classic Corvette handling strong enough to tango with modern super cars. The fully functional ABS and Traction control helps to keep you on the road."

          "The perfect exhaust note is made possible by stainless steel long tube headers and exhaust system. While restomods usually have all of the commodities we’ve come to expect, this car boasts a keyless entry option so that you can hop in and take it for a spin any time you want without obstruction. While some may say that classic canyon carves such as this should be left original, that was never what Corvette was about. The Corvette has always been about being the best in performance and style at a price anyone could afford with some hard work and many muscle car maniacs have forgotten that, this is a welcome reminder."
