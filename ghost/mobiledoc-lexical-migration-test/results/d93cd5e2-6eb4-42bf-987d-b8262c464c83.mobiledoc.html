<p>During the first part of tonight’s episode, Sirota will discuss the Senate’s bipartisan gun safety bill, asking callers a simple question: Should everyone cheer the initiative, or should it be seen as a do-nothing ruse?</p>
<p>In the second part of the episode, Sirota will be joined by Kate Aronoff to discuss <a href="__GHOST_URL__/left-wondering-the-carnivores-dilemma/">her recent “Left Wondering” column</a> for <em>The Lever</em> about ethical consumption under capitalism. We’ll take your questions about consumer decisions, and explore some quandaries like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Can you eat meat and also be a climate activist?</li>
    <li>What’s the most sustainable way to travel?</li>
    <li>Is the “carbon footprint” metric actually helpful? Or is it just the fossil fuel industry foisting responsibility onto individuals?</li>
</ul>
<p>Join us to find out the answers to these questions — and to ask your own.</p>
