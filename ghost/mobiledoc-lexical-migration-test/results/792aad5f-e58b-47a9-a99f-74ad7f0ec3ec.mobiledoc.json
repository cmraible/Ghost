          "Suddenly getting a huge sum of cash can be an overwhelming but welcome experience. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll spend the money wisely, which is exactly what Tre Brown, a 19-year-old Kroger worker in Duluth, Georgia, did after allegedly scamming his employer for almost $1 million in 2 weeks’ time. Among the things he bought was a Chevy Camaro. Then the teenager got caught."

He’s kind of like the guys who steal Hellcats from dealerships, only to wreck out a few blocks away as they try pushing the muscle cars too hard, lacking the experience of how to keep it all under control."

          "Brown’s scheme was pretty simple. From late December and into early January, police say he made up over 40 fake product returns at the store where he worked. The items being returned of course didn’t exist, but Brown processed the return of payment on several different cards. Those amounts ranged from $75 to $87,000. We’re not sure what you can buy at a Kroger for that much, but Brown was suddenly into big money, $980,000 according to authorities when he was caught."

When other employees noticed the discrepancies, they called the police. After an investigation was conduced and Brown was arrested, authorities say they were able to recover a portion of the stolen money and return it to Kroger. Now Brown is facing a charge of theft by taking."
