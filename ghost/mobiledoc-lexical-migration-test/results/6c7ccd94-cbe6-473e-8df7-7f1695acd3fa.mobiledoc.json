Called Model 711 (get it?) this thing makes me want to vomit, and not because it’s a Mustang. Some people might just love it to death, but to me it represents everything wrong with gas station culture, which I’ve been told is going to be obliterated once electric cars sweep the landscape clean. After seeing this abomination, I wish that were true."

But wait, the interior has plenty more cringe kitsch."

The seat inserts repeat the same color scheme as the famous stripes on the 7-Eleven storefronts. Finally, there’s an air “freshener” that smells like the burned coffee you’re always greeted with at the convenience stores. The only thing the car is missing is sticky floors."
