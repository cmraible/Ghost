You might think this is all just propaganda put out by Stellantis, GM, Toyota, etc. or these reported problems might have spooked you from buying a Bronco until all the kinks are worked out. But wait, the fun of being an early adopter goes on as clearly shown in a recent Matt’s Off Road Recovery video."

Instead of the shiny new Blue Oval off-roader getting stuck in some sand or something embarrassing like that, the issue was a bent tie rod. Look, it happens even to Jeeps and Land Cruisers, before anyone tells you differently, so that’s not all that bad."

These days with materials shortages all over that’s sadly not surprising. The shocking part was how he was told it would be two months before the dealer would have a tie rod in stock."

It starts with the crew rescuing a stuck Nissan Xterra (the same vehicle Andy Bernard favored for a while) and finishes with a motorcycle rescue in Arizona by the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. If you want to skip straight to the Bronco rescue, go to 4:53 in the video."
