<p>One of the reasons why this model year is popular is the 3.0-liter flat-six engine is more powerful than some other SC models, producing a factory-rated 204-horsepower. Paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, it makes for plenty of good times for the driver.</p>

<p>You’ll note for such a vintage Porsche, the paint looks exceptional. After a full paint polish, the highest level of ceramic coating was applied, which explains why this car absolutely shines. You shouldn’t be the least bit ashamed of taking this ride to competitive shows or any other event.</p>

<p>This Porsche has been well cared-for its entire life. The current owner bought it from someone in California who had it serviced and maintained through TRE Motorsports. In fact, before the car was listed for sale, TRE installed the SSI Exhaust system, Mom steering wheel, and Porsche Wevo shifter.</p>
