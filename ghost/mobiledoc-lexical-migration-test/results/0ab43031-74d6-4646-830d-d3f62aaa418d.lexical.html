<p>With the 2019 SEMA Show just around the corner, we're starting to see a lot of interesting builds, and one of those happens to be this awesome mash-up of a new 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe and a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Blazer" rel="nofollow">K5 Blazer</a>. After <a href="https://flatoutautos.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Flat Out Autos</a> posted some teaser pictures of their <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/2019-chevy-k5-tahoe-two-door/" rel="nofollow noopener">K5 Tahoe conversion</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/johngardnertv/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">John Gardner</a> of Motorhead Garage let the cat out of the bag with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/johngardnertv/videos/545522199555055?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">video on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Starting life as a loaded 2018 Chevrolet LTZ, the shop transformed the body to look like a first-gen (1969-72) K5 Blazer with the front grille design of a '67-'68 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-c10s-on-motorious/">C10 pickup</a>. Intended for SEMA, this build was far more than slapping the front end of an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1985-chevrolet-blazer-behemoth/">old Blazer</a> onto the Tahoe.</p>
<p>From these images and video, it looks like everything below the Tahoe's factory window line has been replaced with the exception of the door handles. The period-correct blue paint with a white top looks perfect on the K5 Tahoe, and it even features what appear to be OEM-style chrome bumpers and steel wheels.</p>
<p>Even with the extra set of doors, the proportions of the K5 Tahoe aren't all that different from the original Blazer. The only weird part about the design is the factory rake of the windshield that makes the front end look a little too tall. The quality of work that went into this build is commendable, but the hardest part was probably getting those wide front fenders to blended seamlessly into the front doors. Well done! The best part of the whole design has to be the rear end where the "CHEVROLET" lettering is spelled out across the back; Chevy should take note of this for the factory Tahoe.</p>

<p>Love it or hate it, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/2019-chevy-k5-tahoe-two-door/">K5 Tahoe</a> will definitely be a show stopper at this year's SEMA Show, which descends upon the Las Vegas Convention Center November 5th through the 8th.</p>
