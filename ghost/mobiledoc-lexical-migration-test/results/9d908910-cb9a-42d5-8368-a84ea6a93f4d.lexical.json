Case in point: back on July 29 a suspect who allegedly stole a 2011 Chevy Camaro at gunpoint whipped out his phone and took video of himself in the stolen vehicle. Now, we’re not criminal defense attorneys but we’re pretty sure Saul Goodman’s advice of keeping your mouth shut includes not taking videos of yourself committing a crime.",

They took the keys to the car and the victim’s phone, then used to muscle car to get away. It’s possible the suspect recorded the video on the victim’s phone, which also is just such a genius move.",
