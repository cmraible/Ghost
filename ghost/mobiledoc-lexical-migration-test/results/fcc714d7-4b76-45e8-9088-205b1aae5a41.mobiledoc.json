He can let out a big fart that’ll stun nearby enemies, making them vulnerable to the good ol’ brain to mouth hugs that zombies love to do so much; he can throw his organs out like grenades and detonate them to help fight enemies that can attack from range; he can tear his arm off which you then gain control of to help with scouting out ahead and it can also take control of enemies and climb up walls and finally, he can take his head off and roll it like a bowling ball which can then detonate for massive damage.

There are really only three level types: big open areas where all the enemies are thrown at you at once, indoor areas where the main challenge is navigating your horde of zombies through small corridors and streets where enemies shoot at you from above making you hide for cover and find a way up to them. While the levels themselves can be pretty varied at times, with only three different styles of levels, it really does feel like you’re going through the same levels with only a different coat of paint at times."
