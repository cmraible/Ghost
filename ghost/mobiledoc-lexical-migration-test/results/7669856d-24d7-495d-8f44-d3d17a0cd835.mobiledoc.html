<p>Mark Blaha was the first to call 911, when he thought only one car was stolen, so he was completely shocked to find that three vehicles were stolen, and the trailers were empty.</p>

<p>“I opened it up to look to see what they’ve stolen, and the jeep was gone,” said Blaha.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe that all three trailers were empty.</p>

<p>The 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee that was stolen belonged to the customer. Blaha’s owned 2006 Ford Mustang was also stolen. “I was in tears,” Blaha said.</p>
<p>“It’s been an art project,” Blaha said. “The only thing that’s still original is the front fenders.”</p>
<p>The third car that was stolen is the 2016 Chevy Camaro that has been trotted around on display at events like SEMA.</p>
<p>“That 2016 Camero was kind of iconic,” Blaha said. “That will hurt me the most.”</p>
