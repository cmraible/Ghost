          " is more than just a classic military-style Jeep. With an upgraded motor, full roll cage, big winch up front, and more, it's a true useful 4x4 with a true patriotic appearance. Camo green and earned stars instantly makes this one recognize as a military-style machine.  This one even has the right vintage details, like the skinny mud tires, tow hoop, and ax and shovel mounted on the side.  But that XBull 13,000lb winch up front signals this classic Jeep is ready for modern duty, too.  In fact, you have halogen headlamps and a full roll bar, which they would have loved to have had in the Army. There's even a hood scoop and a hint of headers in the fenders that indicate that the power is upgraded, too (more on that in a moment.)"
