<p>A big issue that fans had with Fifa 18 was that you were unable to play online with friends, but that appears to have been rectified with Fifa 19.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that players will be able to play with friends in full best of five online friendlies.</p>
<p>The game is also said to be much closer to the PS4/XB1 counterparts, but that’s all that was mentioned on that. It has also been slated for a September release.</p>
