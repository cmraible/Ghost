<p>An Ermine White body with sparkling chrome trim makes for a clean, classy presentation. Even though this car is shown with the body-color removable hardtop installed, there is a convertible soft top on the car, so if you’re out cruising and need coverage on the go it’s available.</p>

<p>According to the seller, this C1 ‘Vette has been “exceptionally restored to original.” Judging from the details of the exterior, including badging, wheels, etc. that certainly appears to be true. Same goes for the red interior, which sports the factory gauges, steering wheel, controls, rearview mirror, window cranks, and more.</p>

<p>Finding a Powerglide automatic ’62 Corvette isn’t easy, so that makes this car more compelling for those who don’t want to manage three pedals and a shifter. It also comes with the 327ci V8 for nice, smooth power delivery and plenty of fun times on the road.</p>
<p>Even though 1962 was the most popular model year for the C1 Corvette, these cars are highly collectible and a lot of fun to take out for a weekend drive. Everyone recognizes the iconic shape and owning such a classic is a huge conversation starter at gas stations, traffic lights, and pretty much anywhere else.</p>
