<hr>
<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/dave_ferro_collection.aspx">Bill Miller,</a> Jr. co-founded Carlisle Events in 1974. While his name has been attached to America’s Automotive Hometown of Carlisle, Pennsylvania for nearly 50 years, his passion for all things automotive goes back to his early years as an enthusiast. As one can imagine, someone as passionate as Bill has amassed quite the collection of automotive items and as part of this year’s Fall Carlisle Collector Car Auction, select pieces of that collection can be yours! No, Bill is NOT retiring! He has simply decided to sell off items from his personal life-long collection.</p>

<p>Miller will also move more than a dozen classic and collector cars across the Fall Carlisle Collector Car Auction block on Thursday, September 29 at approximately 3 p.m. This time slot is just before the popular all-truck hour. These lots span from the 1930’s to the 2000’s and are low milage and in some cases, one owner cars. Miller has identified a pair of Kaiser Darren’s for the auction, two <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=14432">1981 VW trucks</a>, including one that’s never been titled and a <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=14438">1958 Cadillac two-door</a> hard top with 12,000 original miles and original tires; quite possibly the finest one that money could buy. </p>
