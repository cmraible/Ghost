<hr>
<p>Normally known for its work on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mercedes-benz-coupes-wagons/">Mercedes-Benz</a>, BMW, even Infiniti, German tuning house Larte Design has decided to apply its unique styling to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rebuild-2022-c8-corvette/">C8 Corvette</a>. It offers an additional… edginess to the American mid-engine sports car as well as plenty of exposed carbon-fiber weave to dazzle the eyes.</p>

<p>According to Larte Design, installation of the body kit, which includes 36 unique parts, requires 10 hours for installation. That means customers must wait 14 days for delivery, but we’re willing to bet plenty will find the wait well worth it.</p>
<p>Not everyone is going to fall in love with what Larte Design did, especially those who find the smoother lines of the C8 to be quite attractive. But others will love the sharper hood lines, that aggressive front diffuser, the taller rear wing, and other details of the body kit.</p>
<p>One big benefit of going with a C8 Corvette body kit like this one is it can make convincing your non-car friends that you really own a Ferrari, Lamborghini, or something else similarly exotic far easier. Some people obviously really love that idea while others are proud they own an exotic-looking Chevrolet. <br>If this kit isn’t quite your cup of tea, there are some other options in the aftermarket at the moment. And if you don’t like any of those, we’re sure as time goes on even more body kids for the C8 Corvette will be released.</p>
<p>If you’re possibly interested in this body kit from Larte Design, you need to know it at the moment is only available for 2022 to 2023 Stingrays. Perhaps the tuner will develop one for the new C8 Z06 before too long, but for now it’s not in the cards.</p>
