I seriously under-estimated how much time my City work would take this term, over-committed on my self-employed work, and so was working six day weeks for about two months. I needed a breather, and I've had it.</p><p>I was still occassionaly posting while I was away, but didn't send the posts out as emsails. Down the bottom of this email you'll see links to some of those posts thanks to <a href=\"https://ghost.org/changelog/latest-posts/\">a handy new Ghost feature</a>. I might take advantage of it in the coming weeks to send shorter emails, with more links to other pieces. What do you think?</p><p>Anyway, lovely to see you again. Hope you've been keeping well.</p>"
