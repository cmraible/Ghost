These two monsters toured the United States, robbing anything and everyone they could get their hands on, leaving only a trail of death behind them. After two years of playing a constant game of cat and mouse, the pair was eventually \"caught.\" Of course, we mean that their bodies were violently ripped apart by a seemingly endless barrage of over 50 rounds each, which fit the crimes perfectly. Finally, the murderous duo was stopped, and to celebrate, their car was paraded around America as a show of dominance to any criminals who might try the same stunt. Except, it wasn't actually their car which was hauled around like a thanksgiving turkey. There were, in reality, five separate clones of the ",

This particular car was eventually put up for attraction with a $10,000 guarantee that he owned the faithful Bonnie and Clyde car. You may have guessed that this was not precisely truthful information, and the owner eventually got their asses handed to them in court. The vehicle was confiscated by the prosecuting party. Sometime later, Warner Bros bought the car and used it for their movie \"Bonnie And Clyde\" in 1967.",
