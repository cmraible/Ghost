A matte gunmetal gray paint job is accented by plenty of black trim, and the custom interior has been upgraded with black leather bucket seats, air conditioning and its own set of modern Dakota Digital gauges. Power this beast is a beast of engine with a 525 CID LS3 V8 surely providing more power than this Blazer will ever need."
