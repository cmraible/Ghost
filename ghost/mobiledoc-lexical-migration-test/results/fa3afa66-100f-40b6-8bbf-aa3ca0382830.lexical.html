<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-f-250-six-door-is-rick-ross/">s</a> has pretty much established himself as one of the very few hip-hop artists who know what they’re doing in terms of classic car collecting. Pretty much every musician in that genre likes to gather a ton of vehicles. However, that’s usually all about being boastful, arrogant, and showing your wealth. For Mr. Ross it seems to be a true passion and his latest purchase really sells that point home because it’s just so cool.</p>

<p>Built in 1967, this two-tone silver and black <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fenix-camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> should strike you for multiple reasons. First of all, there is the major thing that makes it stand out from pretty much every other car in his collection. That is, of course, the fact that it’s very subtle. You don’t see a massive set of wheels or some crazy color combination like you might expect from one of his other vehicles. Rather, like most of his classics, this one is tasteful and elegant to the highest degree.</p>
<p>Under the hood seems to be a 350 in.³ Chevy small block V8 engine which is capable of making around 285 hp and 380 ft/lbs of torque. If that sounds familiar to you, then you must know a lot about the SS of that year because that’s exactly what this car is. As the Rick Ross car collection, and subsequent show, continues to expand, we’re all pretty excited to see what other cars are going to be added. However, this Camaro really takes the cake for a subtle nature and honoring an American automotive icon.</p>
