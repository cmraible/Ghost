At the heart of this car is a 351ci Windsor V8, supplying plenty of power. A limited-slip differential, 36-gallon fuel tank, and more gauges than other factory Falcons helped with performance. While the factory-claimed 14.4-second quarter mile isn’t anything to get excited about these days, that was the pride of Australians for some time. Some still consider it to be a true supercar."
