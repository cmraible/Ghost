The thought of racing such a valuable masterpiece might fill some with horror. After all, taking any vehicle on the track can be a recipe for disaster. And while this car has been squirreled away in secure garages most of its life, it’s going to be competing at the Velocity Invitational in mid-November."

Threading this through the infamous Corkscrew on the track with other cars nearby could be a heart-stopping thing to witness, but keep in mind it will be racing against other valuable classics with drivers who will also be exercising caution. However, this could easily be the most expensive ride there."
