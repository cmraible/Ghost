Some more apparent modifications include the massive drag tires that barely hang onto dear life when the driver mashes the gas. In fact, the Jeep has so much power that it lifts the front end into a full wheelie when traction is good. So what is under the hood of this tire burning, Fuel-burning, wheelie machine?",

All of that German engineering and \"refined performance\" wasn't nearly enough to defeat the mighty CJ-5 as it crossed the finish line in just 9.91 seconds.
