It also still has the original block and transmission, plus the shaker assembly and prototype hood. Unfortunately, the seller says the pony suffers from a dropped valve, thanks to a previous owner wrecking it while drag racing. Taking this one-of-a-kind Mustang to the track is a seriously risky move, but fortunately nothing worse happened."

Apparently, he discovered quite a few prototype parts which weren’t used for the production 429s. That adds considerably to the curious nature of this car since it has details you apparently won’t find on another. The seller also says he had Kevin Marti research this car and verify it’s the first four-speed CJ shaker car ever made, which is another detail that could make collectors very excited."
