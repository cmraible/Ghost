          "Plenty of people pay big to own a car once driven by a celebrity, which can help explain the $1,000,000 auction price for Tim Allen’s 2017 Ford GT. The modern supercar, which has only 700 miles on the odometer, was listed on Bring A Trailer, generating plenty of attention. According to the website, almost 121,000 people viewed the lot post. However, only 4 bids were placed, likely because the Ford GT is well out of pretty much everyone’s budget."

He originally shelled out $485,000 for it and had to go through a notoriously rigorous vetting process at the hands of Ford. That means he got away like a bandit on this auction."

After all, Ford only make 1,350 GTs through the 2022 model year, so they’re not exactly common. A lot of people who have plenty of cash but couldn’t or didn’t want to survive the selection process Ford puts prospective buyers through have been waiting to get one second-hand."

Even if that’s the case, there’s little doubt over time the value of the Ford supercar will increase dramatically, making it a solid investment. Plus, you can take it to the track and throw down, something you can’t do with a 401(k)."
