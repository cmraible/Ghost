<hr>
<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=15329">On September</a> 30, 2012, this truck stepped up to race and cleaned up with a speed record from the East Coast Tuning Association for Unblown Fuel Lakester Class at 132 mph. If you want to go racing, or if you want a unique piece for your collection, this same truck is now up for grabs. When the February Lakeland Winter Collector Car Auction kicks off, Carlisle will offer this record holding truck.</p>

It’s also reported that it maintains temperature, has no leaks, and no mechanical issues. The Eggshell White Ford truck features a professionally built 355 Chevy Small Block V8 engine with a roller cam that has been re-cammed for street use. The engine is finished with aluminum heads, a Demon carb, Hugger headers, and is backed by a T10 4-speed manual transmission.</p>

It is equipped with removable engine side panels with custom storage compartments in the truck bed, and rolls on new wheels and tires.</p>
