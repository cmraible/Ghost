Remember my liveblogging from [the Zeitgeist Project in Berlin](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&tag=zeitgeist%20project&limit=20)? They were the people behind it.\n\nHis new blog [Adam’s Apples](http://www.freestate.co.uk/blog/) is a buffet of interesting ideas about narrative expressed in a physical context. Must-read.\n\n\n## Not So Thin Lizzie\n\n![Not So Thin Lizzie - a blog](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2013/07/thin-lizzie1.jpg?resize=655%2C394)  \n One of my (now ex-) students from the Magazine Journalism MA at City University has spun off her own food blog from the project blog she did as part of the Online Journalism module.\n\n[Not So Thin Lizzie](http://notsothinlizzy.com) is a journey through her interest in food. Pop over, salivate a little and give her some encouragement.\n\n\n"
