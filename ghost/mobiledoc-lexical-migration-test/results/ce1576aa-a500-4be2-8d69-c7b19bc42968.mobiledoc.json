It contains 20 turns and runs counterclockwise. When it was built, the naturally hilly terrain was incorporated into the contouring of the track, which accounts for the 133-foot hill at Turn 1, presenting quite the challenge for riders. That sort of fun stretches for 3.41 miles, so the laps aren’t as quick as on some shorter tracks out there."
