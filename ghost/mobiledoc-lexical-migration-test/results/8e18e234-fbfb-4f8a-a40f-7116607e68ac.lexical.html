<hr>
<p>We’ve been saying this for a while, but we’re going to say it once more: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/8-coolest-jdm/">90s JDM cars are hot investments</a>. If you already have one, congratulations. If not, you might want to do some research and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">hunt a good example down now</a> since values in general are on an upward trend. One of the holy grails of the JDM vehicles is of course the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1991-honda-nsx/">Honda NSX</a>. And while these Japanese <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/exotic/">supercars</a> are cool, finding a Type S model is even far more impressive since only 2019 were made.</p>
<p>Hitting the market starting with the 1991 model year, the NSX was a huge shock to the world. Previously, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/honda-wants-your-feedback-on-new-s2000-parts/">Honda</a> had been associated with reliable motorcycles, budget-friendly cars, and lawnmowers, not technologically-advanced, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/exotic/">sexy supercars</a>. By today’s standards the NSX isn’t all that impressive, but back at the beginning of the 90s it sure was.</p>

<p>However, the 90s was a time of increasing performance, and not just for the Japanese brands. Honda needed to do something to really impress enthusiasts. It released the NSX Type R in 1992, a version of the mid-engine car geared specifically at track driving. But as the decade ground on it was necessary to do more and thus the Honda NSX Type S was launched for 1997.</p>
<p>Not quite as high-strung and stripped-down as the Type R, the Type S weighed less than a regular NSX at 2,900 pounds. There was also a Zero version which knocked an additional 100 pounds off the curb weight by deleting AC, navigation, and the stereo.</p>
<p>In addition, the Honda NSX Type S and Type S Zero both had a stiffer suspension than the regular NSX. That make for a more bone-rattling ride, but kept the tires in contact with the road/track surface, even when the car was driven hard. Just like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1991-honda-nsx/">regular NSX</a>, the Type S wasn’t pushing crazy amounts of horsepower, but instead was a very balanced vehicle, responding well to a good thrashing on the track.</p>

<p>Along with the rest of the NSX lineup, the Type S received a facelift for 2002. One of the biggest changes was the deletion of the pop-up headlights, although other cosmetic details were tweaked. Even though the NSX’s engineering was growing a little stale, now far outclassed by offerings from just about every European brand out there, these supercars are still on the wish list of many collectors, a trend you can believe is likely only going to continue.</p>
