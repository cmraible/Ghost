<p>Do you remember when August was the silly season? Well, it hasn't been this year, has it? At the beginning of the week, we had some of the biggest news — if not THE biggest news — of the year: the terrifying new report from the IPCC on the climate crisis. Wolfgang Blau has done some fascinating work on what we, as journalists and other communicators, <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/07/if-youre-not-a-climate-reporter-yet-you-will-be-covid-19-coverage-offers-lessons-for-reporting-on-the-climate-crisis/">should be doing about it</a>. </p>
<p>This is a topic I'm very passionate about — and impacted by right now, as our holiday next week has been cancelled due to unseasonable flooding. Expect me to return to the subject. (And let me know what you think we should be doing.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's a selection of useful reading and watching for you, broken down into categories. I'm intending to do one of these a week during August — as my instinct is that people would prefer less email this month, rather than more. Do let me know if I'm off base with that…</p>

    <li>📜 <a href="https://whatsnewinpublishing.com/how-many-readers-actually-scroll-once-they-load-an-article/?utm_campaign=The%20Media%20Roundup%20from%20Media%20Voices&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">How far do people scroll</a> — and how long do they read when they do? This is useful research, suggesting that calls to action and other points of engagement might be best placed at the end of articles. Also: there appears to be a written journalism version of the “three second rule” from social video: you only have a few seconds to sell your story to the reader, and encourage them to scroll.</li>

We knew this was likely — we'll now see which publications have been working hardest to retain those extra readers. </li>

    <li>🤑 The <em>NYT</em> is making <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/technology/facebook-soccer-racism.html">a bunch of its newsletters subscriber-only</a>. It's far from the first to do this: in the UK, <em>The Times</em> and <em>The FT</em> already do. But it's interesting to note that newsletters have evolved beyond a website marketing tool into valuable products in their own right. </li>
    <li>🤔 <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/sit-right-down-and-write-yourself-a-letter">Substack has acquired Letter</a>, a “platform for written debate”.
