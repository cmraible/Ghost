After all, it’s amazing to feel the rumble of an engine pushing ridiculous horsepower and that surge when you press on the accelerator. Plus, if you can keep the thing going in a straight line and do a clean launch, you get to brag to your friends about taming a beast most couldn’t handle."

The one he’s driving is Ken Miles’ 289 Cobra used in the racing scenes filmed at Willow Springs at the beginning of the movie. It’s a car anyone with the cash can buy now and Farah gives it a glowing recommendation."

The 289 V8 is stroked to 331 cubic inches and is pushing 375-hp, plenty to get the little roadster moving in a hurry. Sure, it doesn’t look all muscular with the fat tires and the wire wheels might not be as appealing to some, but Farah argues the balance of the roadster more than makes up for all that. Check out his reasoning for why that is and make up your own mind whether he’s right or off his rocker."
