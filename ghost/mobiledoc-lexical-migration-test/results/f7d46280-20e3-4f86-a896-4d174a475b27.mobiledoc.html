<p>Exterior-wise, this truck sits plenty low to the ground. While we don't have the details on its suspension work, this pickup certainly has that perfect stance and ride height. Painted in an attractive gleaming gold, this C10 will no problem turning some heads rolling through town. A set of American Racing chrome wheels add the perfect touch while making this classic pickup's exterior finish stand out even more. Another menacing touch is the addition of a cowl hood, and this stylish pickup has a different rear.</p>
<p>Pop the hood to a sinister modern powerplant that will have this truck hauling more than just the mail. Stuffed inside the engine bay is a 6.0-liter Vortec V8 engine normally found in the modern 2010+ Chevrolet Silverados and GMC Sierra 2500/3500 series trucks. Even the fuel-injected '57 badges on the side are an indication that something more sinister is lurking under the hood. Stopping power is provided by upgraded brakes by CPP. </p>
<p>Open the doors to reveal an incredibly clean interior complete with a comfortable bench seat. The dashboard is also aesthetically pleasing being paint matched complete with large black accents all around.</p>
