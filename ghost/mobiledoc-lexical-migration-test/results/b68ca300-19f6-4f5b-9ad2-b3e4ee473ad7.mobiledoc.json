In the earlier years of the automaker's history, it was all about racing and pushing the limits of what the car can do on a track. However, the Ferrari name eventually grew to represent power, style, and wealth while also combining the best attributes  of racers for road applications. Essentially, this is how we view the cars now and this  particular vehicle is a great example of how the prancing pony of Italy got their name."
