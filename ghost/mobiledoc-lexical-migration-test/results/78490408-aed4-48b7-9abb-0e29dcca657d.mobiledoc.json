The two-seat AMX was a big hit on the auto show circuit in 1966 and featured a rumble seat that opened out from the rear deck lid for extra passengers called a \"Ramble\" seat. AMC executives saw the opportunity to change the consumers' perception of the automaker from Romney's economy car image, to the realities of the new marketplace interested in sporty, performance oriented vehicles. Robert B. Evans requested a car like the AMX to be put into production quickly."

As a way to promote the new car, AMC's Performance activities manager, Carl Chakmakian, asked Breedlove to put the AMX through its paces before it was even available for sale.
