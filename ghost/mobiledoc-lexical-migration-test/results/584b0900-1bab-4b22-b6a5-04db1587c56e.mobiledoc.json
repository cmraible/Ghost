          "One of the things that’s all the rage in some enthusiast circles these days is heavy patina on classic cars. This 1953 Pontiac Chieftain has plenty of it after years of sitting, but the owner decided to correct that problem with a $2,500 Maaco paint job. The move is proving to be fairly controversial as everyone has different opinions of not only whether he should have done this but also what would’ve been a better alternative."

Then there are the rust-appearance car wraps we’ve seen applied not only to older vehicles but also new rides. Hey, everyone has their thing."

If it’s not the factory color, it’s probably something that was used in the factory or it’s at least period correct. Some people think he should’ve stuck with that color or at least another pastel. The Plum Crazy he did go with looks nice, especially for $2,500, but you have to wonder how it’ll hold up over time. Plus it’s not a Pontiac color at all, a fact which makes some people, well… crazy."
