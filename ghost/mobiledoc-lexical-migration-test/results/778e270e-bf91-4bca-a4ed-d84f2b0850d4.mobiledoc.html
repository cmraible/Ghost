<p>The Shelby Mustang is a high-performance variant of the Ford Mustang which was built by Shelby American from 1965-1970.</p>
<p>The 1965-66 cars were the smallest and lightest of the GT 350. The cars were often called "Cobras." All GT 350s were Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Very few had the actual "Le Mans" top stripes.</p>
<p>The hood was made of fiberglass and featured a functional hood scoop. No rear seats were available because a spare tire was relocated there to compete as a "sports car" in the SCCA, as the trunk now house the battery.</p>
<p>Shelby modified Ford's stock high-performance engine from 271 hp to 306 hp with the help of an aluminum high-rise intake manifold, a 715 cfm Holley four-barrel carb, and steel Tri-Y headers leading to a dual, side-exit exhaust with glasspack mufflers.</p>
<p>Only one transmission was available, the Borg Warner T-10 4-speed manual. Silver plated rims with chrome lug nuts sporting Goodyear Blue-Dots were standard, and Cragar mags were optional.</p>
<p>A race version "R" was available in addition to the street version and featured an engine oil cooler, a larger capacity radiator, front and rear brake cooling assemblies, a 34 gallson gas tank, 3.5 in quick-fill gas cap, electri fuel pump, larger exhaust pipes with no muffler, five mag 15x7 wheels, interior safety group (fire extinguisher, plastic rear window, etc.), complete instrumentation, and more mods were made to engine cranking out to 370 hp.</p>
