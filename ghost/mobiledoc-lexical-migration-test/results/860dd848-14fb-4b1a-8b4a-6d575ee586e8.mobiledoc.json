In this game, you'll flick through the pages of a novel, enveloping yourself in the story as it unfolds based on the responses and actions you choose. However, the coastal town of Innsmouth is not all it seems to be on the tourist brochures and its hidden secrets will present themselves the further you delve."

The humour is dark, most commonly commenting on obsurdities within the strange town that is Innsmouth, as well as its inhabitants.
