<hr>
<p>The first generation run of the Ford GT quickly propelled the car into American supercar status, and it all started with a 2005 Ford GT, just like this one up for grabs. This mid-engine beauty is a part of the limited production first year run, and it’s super low mileage as a bonus, making it an ideal modern classic collectible.</p>

<p>When Ford came up with the idea to release a street legal supercar under their moniker, they were inspired by the iconic GT40, four time consecutive champion of the "24 Hours of LeMans”. It is built using a lightweight aluminum space frame and body, and a powerful 5.4-liter supercharged engine carries the lightweight body effortlessly.</p>

<p>The mid-engine powertrain funnels 550-horsepower and 500 ft/lbs of torque through a six-speed manual transmission, and gives the car the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour in approximately 3.3-seconds, with a top speed of almost 200 mph.</p>
<p>Ford limited production on this model to keep it exclusive, and that’s turned it into a highly sought after collectible. With only 1900 total 2005 Ford GTs produced, finding one for sale isn’t always an easy task, but this example from Triple F Automotive is a perfect choice, with only 1400 miles on the clock.
