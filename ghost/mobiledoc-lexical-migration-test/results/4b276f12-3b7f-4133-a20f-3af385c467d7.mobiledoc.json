While many celebrities have an impressive car collection, as does Curren$y, he has a collection that most don’t - a toy car collection that spans an entire room! When it comes to his miniature car collection he has quite a diverse display of his tastes. This collection has ‘something for everyone’ when it comes to the variety."

He’s a true car guy, and tends to lean towards towards Chevys, especially muscle cars and lowriders, but does appreciate an exotic or two. If you live in the New Orleans area, it might be worth catching up with one of his meets, albeit, don’t expect to see any of the miniature car collection at the shows."
