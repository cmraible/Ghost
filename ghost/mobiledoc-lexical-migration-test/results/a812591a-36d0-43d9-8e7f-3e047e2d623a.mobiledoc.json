After over 3 decades nobody thought the muscle car would be recovered, but a chance encounter by two fishermen on Geist Reservoir has uncovered the watery grave. It’s not the happy ending perhaps the owner had dreamed of in the past, but at least now there can be some type of closure."

As we’ve seen in other river and lake recoveries, the process can be difficult and dangerous, but they were able to extract the vehicle without any reported problems."
