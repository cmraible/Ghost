<hr>
<p>Back in the 1950s, <a href="https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/cars-for-sale/chevrolet/3100/2492917.html">pickups started</a> to shift from dedicated workhorses to becoming more customer-focused vehicles. It was the beginning of the pickup truck boom, this 1951 Chevrolet 3100 pickup is a great example from that era - this is no run-of-the-mill vehicle either. The details of this truck make it a very attractive find for those looking for a beautifully restored vintage pickup.</p>

<p>This particular Chevy seems to be pretty clean and well-sorted, making it a perfect acquisition if you’re looking for a vehicle you can take the rest of the way. All those light blue body panels are straight and have consistent gaps between, while the trim pieces are present and also looking good. In fact, the chrome bumpers, grille, headlight bezels, etc. all have a nice shine to them. </p>
