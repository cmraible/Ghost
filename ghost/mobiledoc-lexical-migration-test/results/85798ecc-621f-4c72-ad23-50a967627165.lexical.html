<p>We’re always <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bagged-ferrari/">keeping an eye out for interesting cars for sale</a>, and this time we have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-lowrider-truck-event-and-cry/">something quite unique</a>. The Rat God, a 1930 Ford Model A rat rod was featured at the 2018 SEMA Show in Las Vegas at the Thrush Booth. Now it’s available to purchase <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/what-happened-to-ebay-motors/">on eBay</a> with a Buy It Now price of $77,500. The big question is, would you pay that much for it?</p>

<p>By nature, rad rods are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thor-is-an-insane-3-974-hp-13-2-million-semi/">pretty outrageous</a> cars and that’s what people love about them. This is one of the most outrageous we’ve seen yet, but does that make it one of the greatest?</p>
<p>The air ride suspension <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-lowrider-truck-event-and-cry/">has been lowered so close to the ground</a> ants might have trouble doing under. There’s a Chevy 496 Roller BBC up front with Merlin heads and a heavy cam. Not surprisingly, the headers and exhaust are custom-made, because wow they’re extreme.</p>

<p>Other details include a custom patina airbrushed on the body, custom aluminum interior, fully tubular frame, and an open roof for taller drivers/passengers to potentially use so they can see around the massive engine. The seats come with harnesses and there’s a blood red skull between them, because why not?</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to be gawking at The Rat God. According to eBay at the time of writing this article it was averaging 33 views an hour, which is pretty good for the site. You can take your time to marshal up the cash to purchase this vehicle. Not only is it available until Monday, May 25 at 12:43 pm EDT, you only need to put down a $500 deposit up front. The listing claims this car would be much more expensive through “most dealers.” Check out the listing yourself <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/114225029088?ul_noapp=true">here</a>.</p>
