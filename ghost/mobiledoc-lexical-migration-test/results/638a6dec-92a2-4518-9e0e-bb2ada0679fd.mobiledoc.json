That limit for the Antioch Police Department in California was when a guy in a white Chevy Camaro decided to turn some subpar examples out in the Marina parking lot. Not only did he fail to really produce the goods, like a true amateur he crashed his muscle car into one of the light poles. But wait, it gets even worse."

That’s right, police say the driver did just that, but they’d already received a call about the attempted smoking of rear tires (emphasis on “attempted”) plus the whole thing was caught on the rather clear surveillance video. This guy was going to get away with nothing."

A lot of morons who do participate in them wreck their cars like this guy, plus people get hurt."
