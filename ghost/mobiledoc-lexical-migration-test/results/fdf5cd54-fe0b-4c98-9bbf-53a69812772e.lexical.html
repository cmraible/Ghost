<p>In April, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported that prices for consumer goods had increased by 8.5 percent over the past year — the largest increase since 1982. Here’s what’s behind the higher prices:</p>
<p>• <strong>Corporate Profiteering: </strong>Business earnings are at their highest level <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/2021-was-best-year-for-u-s-corporation-profits-since-1950">since 1950</a>, meaning prices are increasing more than costs. In all, a <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/">new Economic Policy Institute report</a> shows that more than half of the price increases in the last two years can be attributed to larger profit margins. Those profits are far <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/inflation-corporate-america-increased-prices-profits">outpacing increases</a> in worker wages.</p>

<p>• <strong>Fossil Fuel Fleecing: </strong>Fuel costs have been a key driver of inflation. Fossil fuel companies insist that’s because investors are under pressure from climate activists and the Biden administration to stop financing fossil fuels. But <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2022/2201.aspx#tab-report">investors say they are pulling</a> back after years of overproduction and poor returns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only further driven up prices, because Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter. Meanwhile, oil companies are seeing <a href="https://www.accountable.us/news/big-oil-companies-net-75-billion-in-profit-while-americans-struggle-to-heat-homes-fill-gas-tanks/">massive profits</a>, which suggests price increases are outpacing rises in their input costs.</p>
<p>• <strong>The Housing Heist: </strong>Rent and home prices<em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-01/u-s-rent-inflation-on-real-estate-property-allows-landlords-to-regain-leverage">are skyrocketing</a></em> because of pandemic-induced migration and commodity shortages, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-07/buying-starter-homes-gets-harder-as-wall-street-uses-zillow-to-buy-thousands">private equity</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-02-18/wall-street-banker-profits-off-phoenix-housing-inflation-and-soaring-rent-prices">firms buying</a><a href="https://pestakeholder.org/bloomberg-businessweek-wall-street-is-buying-starter-homes-to-quietly-become-americas-landlord/">homes</a>, as well as years of underinvestment in housing and restrictive local zoning laws preventing new construction. The average asking rent is up more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2022/03/25/inflation-soaring-rents-and-the-housing-crisis/?sh=5c87aa9916f5">15 percent</a> year over year, and home prices are up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/homes/us-home-prices-case-shiller-february-2022/index.html">nearly 20 percent</a>.</p>
<p>• <strong>Supply Chain Problems: </strong>A global supply chain crisis — caused by <a href="https://prospect.org/supply-chain">decades of privatization, disinvestment, corporate consolidation</a>, <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/12/shortages-logistics-transportation-just-in-time-labor">poor working conditions</a> in certain industries, and other factors — was inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to price increases for key commodities including semiconductors, lumber, and fertilizer. This, in turn, has made new cars, homes, and food more expensive.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-lies-about-inflation">THE BIG LIES ABOUT INFLATION</h3>
<p>• <strong>Lie #1: The Problem Is Government Spending:</strong> In an attempt to block student debt relief and other spending, pro-business <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/04/06/larry-summers-i-told-you-so-inflation-tour-00023430">economists</a>, corporatist <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-10/manchin-casts-more-doubt-on-biden-agenda-with-blast-on-inflation">lawmakers</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/opinion/inflation-supply-chain.html">swamp creatures</a> have attempted to place the blame for price increases on stimulus checks and unemployment payments<strong>, </strong>arguing that the COVID relief created more demand than the economy could handle. But the Federal Reserve estimates this relief only contributed to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/fed-study-points-finger-at-fiscal-boost-for-high-u-s-inflation">small bump in inflation</a>, while at the same time lifting millions of people out of poverty.</p>
<p>• <strong>Lie #2: The Problem Is Workers’ Wages: </strong>MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle <a href="__GHOST_URL__/six-things-theyre-not-telling-you-about-inflation/">claimed</a> last November that “higher wages are one of the contributing factors to inflation,” but a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/profits-and-the-pandemic-as-shareholder-wealth-soared-workers-were-left-behind/">new Brookings Institution study</a> of 22 big corporations found that shareholder wealth grew by 57 times as much as worker wages at those companies. The Economic Policy Institute report similarly found that wage increases are responsible for less than 10 percent of the increased prices of goods — far less than corporate profiteering.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-be-done">WHAT CAN BE DONE?</h3>
<p>• <strong>Raise Taxes: </strong>In the short term, Congress could raise taxes on <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/04/27/price-gouging-corporate-greed-driving-inflation/7445429001/?gnt-cfr=1">corporations</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-27/to-fight-inflation-biden-should-tax-the-rich-shrink-the-deficit">capital gains</a> in order to take aim at outsized profits and excessive demand from the wealthy. The Biden administration could also investigate corporations for price gouging.</p>
<p>• <strong>Bust The Trusts</strong>: In the longer term, economist Hal Singer <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/antitrust-should-be-used-to-fight-inflation/">argues</a> that the government could enforce antitrust laws against monopolies that are using their outsized market power to jack up prices without fear of being undersold by competitors. The Biden administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-inflation.amp.html">reportedly</a> been exploring antitrust as an anti-inflation tool.</p>
<p>• <strong>Move Away From Fossil Fuels: </strong>Congress could tackle fuel prices by<strong><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164528/deal-inflation-get-off-fossil-fuels">investing in clean energy</a></strong>. Instead, Biden and congressional Democrats <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/166031/democrats-gas-prices-oil-companies-drilling">have been</a><a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/04/the-big-idea-behind-joe-bidens-plan-to-bring-down-gas-prices.html">begging companies</a> to increase fossil fuel drilling, in direct conflict with their stated climate commitments. Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/03/31/strategic-petroleum-reserve-release-biden/">has also used his</a><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aaebf4c8-919e-4b13-9703-e548ed705e4c">executive authority</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/climate/biden-drilling-oil-leases.html">to enable more</a> domestic fossil fuel production <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-increases-lng-exports-as-europe-faces-energy-crisis/">and</a><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/598496-biden-administration-approves-more-lng-exports/">exports</a>. But these actions <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/oil-prices-may-not-drop-even-as-companies-drill-more/">still may not</a> lower energy prices, and are guaranteed to exacerbate the climate crisis.</p>
<p>• <strong>Unionize Now: </strong>Right now, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/profits-and-the-pandemic-as-shareholder-wealth-soared-workers-were-left-behind/">most economic growth is being delivered to the wealthy</a>, which has meant inflation is most acutely hitting workers, whose wages are <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/31/wages-rise-but-prices-rise-more/">not keeping up with price increases</a>. The best way workers can claim a larger share of economic growth is to increase union density. Congress can help by <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-lawmakers-nlrb-funding_n_62685ae9e4b0197ae3fc2686">better funding</a> the National Labor Relations Board and passing long-promised <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842">labor law reforms</a>. Biden could also use <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-offers-amazon-workers-rhetoric-but-no-action/">executive action</a> to enforce labor laws and stop subsidizing union busters.</p>
<p>• <strong>Raise Interest Rates: </strong>The Federal Reserve is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fed-wants-to-raise-rates-quickly-but-may-not-know-where-to-stop-11650792603">planning to jack up</a> interest rates, but that could hurt working people. That’s because raising interest rates causes businesses to cut back on investments and suppresses household demand, which can slow down the economy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/05/fed-raise-interest-rates-shaft-american-workers-robert-reich">lead to layoffs</a>, as well as make it harder for workers to demand wage increases. What’s more, raising interest rates could be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/opinion/fed-inflation-interest-rates-third-world-debt.html?">destructive to developing nations</a> that hold foreign debt, further exacerbating poor economic conditions around the world.</p>
