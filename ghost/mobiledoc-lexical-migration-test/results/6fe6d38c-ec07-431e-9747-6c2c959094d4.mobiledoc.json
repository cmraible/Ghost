One possible explanation was highlighted in a recent report out of Denver, Colorado where police say they’re arresting car thieves, only for them to be released and then arrested again. As a result, car theft in the Denver metro is up 24% in the first quarter of 2022."

In other words, if you live in or near Denver and haven’t had your car stolen or know someone who has, that could change very soon."

A spokesman for C-MATT said some felony cases involve plea bargaining where the defendant serves no time, sometimes with the charges just dismissed, so defendants are back on the street stealing vehicles again. The taskforce even claims some violent offenders are getting off easy."

          "This is frustrating to hear but frankly not surprising. We’ve seen other parts of the country where it seems like car thieves have more rights than vehicle owners. While you can take steps to secure your ride, if the thieves are determined and have the right equipment, they will take it. Considering mounting evidence that many of these thefts are fueled by organized crime, one would think prosecutors would take the situation more seriously. Instead, they’re content to make law enforcement catch the same guys over and over with little to no punishment involved."
