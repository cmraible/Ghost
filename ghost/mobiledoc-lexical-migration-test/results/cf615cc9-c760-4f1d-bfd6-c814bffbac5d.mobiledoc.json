Paired with that striking color is nearly perfect chrome plating on the trim and hubcaps. This well-documented MGA has a track record of winning shows and it’s easy to see why."

With a black color scheme and green accents on the dash as well as seat piping, plus a white headliner, it presents nicely. Plenty of factory features abound, including switchgear, steering wheel, and radio. Sitting in this MG is like being transported back into the 1950s."

That setup paired with a 4-speed manual transmission and tight, responsive handling means plenty of fun behind the wheel and a truly entertaining British motoring experience. With limited miles put on this vehicle since the restoration, everything is working and ready for your enjoyment."
