Despite having 200 miles on the clock, the car is basically new. Its bright yellow splitter guards are still in place and the protective plastic over the interior has not been removed. Regardless of the Demons original $85,000 MSRP from three years ago, at the time this was published the current high bid for this car was at $122,000 with 15 days to go. So, if you are looking to bring this car home, it would appear that you are not alone and you might have your work cut out for you."
