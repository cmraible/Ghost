          "The founders of E.C.D. Automotive Design grew up in England (the Midlands) just 40 miles away from the Lode Lane factory that produced Land Rover Defenders. Founded by Tom, Elliot, and Scott, have a love for vehicles, especially classic English examples. That may be apparent by their very first cars as Elliot's was an 1987 Austin Mini and Tom's was a '67 MGB Roadster. In 2012, Tom and his wife, Emily, moved to the United States and opened a dealership to import the vehicles they were passionate about. In 2013, E.C.D. Automotive Design opened up shop with just Tom, his brother Elliot and the first employee, Brandon, spending oer 18 hours a day working hard. Now, they have a facility that is over 30,000 square feet and over 50 full-time employees that build these amazing custom builds."
