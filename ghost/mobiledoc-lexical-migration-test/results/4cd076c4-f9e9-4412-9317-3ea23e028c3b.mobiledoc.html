<hr>
<p>According to a recent report, authorities in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/massachusetts-over-regulations/">Massachusetts</a> recently arrested the alleged ringleader of a shoplifting enterprise. Through <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-using-wildlife-cameras/">less-than-honest means</a>, law enforcement believe he amassed over $1 million dollars, as well as a growing collection of cars, including a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1969-chevrolet-camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro</a>. While he had only attained 4 vehicles at the time of his arrest, we have no doubt the man had plans to acquire more.</p>

<p>When police arrested the man, they found over 6,000 items which allegedly were all <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/another-car-stolen-dumb-reason/">stolen</a>. Those included the 4 cars, which aside from the Camaro were a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tesla-model-3-crash/">Tesla</a>, Jeep, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/chevy-silverado-callaway/">Chevy Silverado</a>. Just like shoplifting, stealing vehicles certainly isn’t a victimless crime, even if he swiped all of those from dealerships.</p>
<p>As property is stolen from businesses, the financial loss the businesses suffer are ultimately transferred to consumers. This might be in the form of higher prices, fewer services, shorter operating hours, etc. While an insurance policy might cover some of the stolen items, too many claims from a business will increase their premium payments. That increase is also passed along to consumers. So, in the end we all end up paying the price for thieves’ crimes, quite literally.</p>
<p>The investigation into this theft ring started back in February after a traffic stop and warrant arrest. With the vehicle and its other occupants in the system, it was reported just a short time later in a shoplifting incident, so police knew who to start investigating. What they uncovered was that a retail establishment was paying people for stolen merchandise, then reselling it online.</p>
<p>We’d love to say that crime doesn’t pay, but in the short term it absolutely can. One might use illegal activities to build quite the car collection. However, eventually you will be caught and prosecuted, so we recommend doing things legitimately. After all, this guy lost his collection and is sitting in jail now, with more consequences to come.</p>
