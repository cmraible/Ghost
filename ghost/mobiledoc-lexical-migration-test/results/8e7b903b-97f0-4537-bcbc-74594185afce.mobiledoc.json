That paint looks like it absolutely gleams in the sunlight along with the polished wheels and chrome trim. So you’re ready for races or just fun drives in less-than-ideal conditions, there are four auxiliary lights mounted up front. This is a well-preserved example of a rare classic."

It was designed to carry a family, thanks to an interior which is deceptively large. This was achieved in part by pushing the wheels to the four corners, something which also contributes to the amazing handling characteristics of the car."
