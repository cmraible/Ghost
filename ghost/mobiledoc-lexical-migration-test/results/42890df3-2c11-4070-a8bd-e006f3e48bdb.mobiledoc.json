That's this one was used for racing, and after racking up around 37,000 miles, it suffered a hard impact that resulted in the aero-shaped nose being replaced with the front end of a Plymouth GTX. This treatment actually looks really cool on this Superbird, and it must have looked really cool seeing this car on the road as the owner says he drove it 130 miles to the Carlisle event."

On top of that, it's missing the original fender trim tag and the 440 cubic-inch engine required more work as it was seized after being pulled from the barn â€“ or perhaps that's what led to this rare 'Bird being parked in the first place."

It was no surprise that rescuing the Superbirds was no easy ordeal, and we can't imagine it was a cheap ordeal either as each car is probably worth close to six figures in its current condition. Fortunately, it sounds like a restoration is in the cards for these winged warriors."
