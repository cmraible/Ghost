It was a different time then, one where advertisers would get really creative, sometimes doing absolutely bizarre but mostly wholesome things to entice consumers. Then there’s this commercial for the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS Pace Car."

It’s almost like a fever dream and one of those really bizarre perfume commercials had a love child. If that were this whole advertisement we would be weirded out, but it gets even worse."

Each one of these guys is a cheesy stereotype, like the American who talks with a southern accent and chomps on a hot dog. Why aren’t there piles of Cheese Whiz on the thing?"

He’s surrounded by adoring women who just can’t keep their hands off him. He goes on about how “bella” or beautiful and elegant the Camaro is, like that has something to do with performance. Yeah, we know it’s a silly commercial but wow, just wow."

A commercial like this could never air today for many reasons."
