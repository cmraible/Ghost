As prices come down, it will be interesting to see how sales continue to be affected, but it’s easy to guess they will overall increase. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will continue to hike rates, leading banks to follow suit, so anyone borrowing money to purchase a vehicle won’t have as much buying power. In other words, yet again cash is king as the cost of borrowing skyrockets."
