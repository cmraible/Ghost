<hr>
<p>Before anyone goes another moment believing crazy conspiracy theories, know this: there are no <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-production-halt/">C8 Corvette shortages</a>. Sure, there might not be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-production-resumes-yet-again/">many Camaros being made lately</a>, or a lot of other cars, but GM apparently is cranking out so many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-z06-2023/">mid-engine sports cars</a> the factory in Bowling Green is “at capacity.”</p>
<blockquote><em>Meanwhile, the C8 Z06 is getting bumped back a year. Learn why <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-z06-2023/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t recall, GM had to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-production-halt/">pause C8 Corvette production</a> at the tail end of May and the beginning of June. That shutdown was never explained, other than the automaker saying there was a parts shortage which wasn’t related to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/surging-prices-used-cars/">computer chip shortages</a> which have sidelined the Camaro repeatedly.</p>

<p>Well, after that shutdown in Bowling Green, the factory opened and reportedly has been running at “full production capacity” since. That apparently means two shifts working hard to bring you a mid-engine American sports car.</p>
<p>Demand for the C8 Corvette has been intense since it launched for the 2020 model year. It seems like everyone wants to get their hands on the car, which has led some to flip theirs for big bucks. And while orders for the 2021 model year have been officially closed for a while now, dealers have been taking orders for 2022 Chevrolet Corvettes since July 1.</p>

<p>Production of the 2022 model year, which introduces several updates, begins in early September. However, even with the factory supposedly running “at capacity” it’s not enough to keep up with demand. That’s not necessarily a bad position for the automaker to be in, since high demand helps ensure cars aren’t just sitting at dealerships for months on end. However, GM risks angering enthusiasts if they have to wait too long to get a car. It’s a delicate dance for one of the hottest performance vehicles on the market.</p>
