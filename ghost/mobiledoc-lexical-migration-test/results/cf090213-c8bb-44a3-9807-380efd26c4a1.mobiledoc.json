Miller owned about 80 Corvettes over his lifetime. Sadly, Chip Miller passed away in 2004 of amyloidosis, and that's when his wife Judy and partner Bill started the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation in his honor. Many know Carlisle as the place to be for collector and classic cars as it is one of the biggest events in the country, and the Spring Carlisle show is a must for any car enthusiast. Corvettes of Carlisle is the largest gathering of 'Vettes in the world, bringing in about 5,000 each year."
