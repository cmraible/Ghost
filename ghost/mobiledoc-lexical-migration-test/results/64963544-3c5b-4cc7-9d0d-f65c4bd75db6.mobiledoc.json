That is where these renderings and reality differ as the artist was able to maintain the Chargers stance while adding two more doors, an extended roof, and what appears to be more interior room. Although you will have to use your imagination to get an idea of what the interior would look like because the artist stopped at just the single angle. It is also hard to imagine how the trunk or hatch in the renderings case would function though. In fact it almost appears that this design would have cost the Charger a bit of trunk space. "
