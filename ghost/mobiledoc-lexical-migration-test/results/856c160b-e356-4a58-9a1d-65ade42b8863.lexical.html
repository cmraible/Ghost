<p>Last month, the U.S. added just 245,000 jobs. If hiring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/04/november-jobs-report-slowdown-economy-recovery/">continues at that pace</a>, it will take more than 3 years before we regain all of the jobs lost in early spring.</p>

<p>Xavier Becerra, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-hhs-pick-backed-medicare-for/">Biden’s pick for HHS</a>, is a Medicare for All supporter who's pushed for HHS to use rules on the books to seize patents in order to lower drug prices. He’s <a href="https://heal-ca.org/for-california-attorney-general-xavier-becerra-resistance-is-personal/">described himself</a> as a “single-payer advocate all my life.” His selection comes after Wall Street darling Gina Raimondo removed her name from consideration.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>YES, VACCINE MAKERS DO GET GOVERNMENT HELP: </strong>To justify charging Americans high prices for a COVID vaccine, drugmakers like Pfizer are holding themselves out as free-market success stories who need to recoup their R&D expenses. However, Big Pharma <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDrAltExPn6RmkPv96MSGIaHsfg7Gtmwj7TV50-3boA/edit">receives huge government subsidies</a> and then returns the favor by charging Americans the world’s highest prices for medicine.</li>
    <li><strong>BLACKSTONE CEO GIVES ANOTHER $15 MILLION TO SENATE GOP: </strong>Billionaire Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman has now <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewperezdc/status/1334627916613898241">donated $35 million</a> this election cycle to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to keep the chamber red. Blackstone reported paying <a href="__GHOST_URL__/billionaire-gop-donors-firm-reports/">a negative tax rate</a> in 2019, thanks to the GOP tax law.</li>
    <li><strong>SARA GIDEON’S DRY POWDER:</strong> Maine Senate candidate Sara Gideon lost a close race against vulnerable Republican Sen. Susan Collins. Her campaign still had <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/gideons-conundrum-what-to-do-with-all-that-extra-money/">$14.8 million</a> in the bank after the November election.</li>
    <li><strong>BIDEN PROMISED TRANSPARENCY, BUT WILL HE DELIVER?: </strong>While federal law requires federal officials to disclose sources of income over $5,000, a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/05/biden-nominees-disclosure-exemption/">loophole</a> allows non-disclosure for information that is “confidential as a result of a privileged relationship, established by law.” A number of Biden’s nominees have come through WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm that does not disclose its clients.</li>
    <li><strong>CLIMATE CHANGE IS KILLING US ALARMINGLY QUICKLY: </strong>A <a href="http://www.thelancet-press.com/embargo/climatecountdown.pdf">new report</a> published in The Lancet has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/climate/climate-change-health-risks.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimesscience">found</a> that extreme heat is killing Americans with no signs of stopping. The report found that in the last 20 years, that there has been a 50 percent increase in heat-related deaths among people over 65.</li>
    <li><strong>UN WARNS OF FAMINE IN YEMEN:</strong> A <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/window-prevent-famine-yemen-narrowing-un-agencies-warn">new report</a> from the UN is urging action as the number of people facing catastrophic food insecurity in Yemen is expected to nearly triple by June, reaching as high as 47,000.</li>
