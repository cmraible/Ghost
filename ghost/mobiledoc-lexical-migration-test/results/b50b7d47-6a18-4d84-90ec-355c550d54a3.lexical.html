<hr>
<p>If you’re anything like us, you’ve seen so many car builds that you’re not easily impressed. However, this Martini Mustang really made us stop and marvel as it is a work of art on four wheels, not just another warmed-over first-gen Ford <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">Mustang Fastback</a>. As you can see and hear about in the included video, this vehicle is packed full of interesting details it can take someone a while to even fully appreciate.</p>

<p>Of course, the first that’s going to impress you is that iconic Martini Racing Livery on a beautiful, straight white body. It’s a clean design with knock-off wheels, Wilwood brake calipers which are dark gray so they don’t stand out, and other little details which don’t jump out at you.</p>

<p>It’s not just the looks of this Martini Mustang that’s amazing. The thing is powered by a 1966 Ford/<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-lotus-elise/">Lotus</a> Indy Car engine, so it backs up its bravado with some pretty serious performance. This major detail also makes the pony car even more unique and special.</p>

<p>Built by Steve Strope of Pure Vision, the idea for this creation came from a daydream of his. Strope wondered what it would’ve been like had Ford and Martini Racing got together to dominate the rally racing scene in Europe back in the day. It’s a compelling thought which has resulted in an equally interesting build. And as the man himself observes right at the beginning of the video, he’s a true car nut through and through, not just going through a phase.</p>
<p>You have to admire the guy’s drive and determination, although as he describes it the car fanaticism can also feel like a cancer. But as they say the proof is in the pudding and if this build is the result of his efforts, we think it’s hands-down a good thing.</p>
