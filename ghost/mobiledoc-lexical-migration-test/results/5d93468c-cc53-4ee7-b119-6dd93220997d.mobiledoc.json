While this Ferrari 330 P2 Junior did set a new record, the previous record holder was a 1958 250 Ferrari Testa Rossa replica which was auctioned by RM Sotheby’s in New York back in 2013 for $126,500. Considering that vehicle was produced over half a century ago and is believed to be 1 of 5 left out of a production run of only 34, it’s a little easier to understand why the car sold for so much. Still, this shows that such collectibles can be worth serious bucks, so if you happen to own one you should be taking good care of it."
