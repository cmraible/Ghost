          "On the morning of January 15, police were called after reportedly a carjacking attempt took place in the parking lot of Royal Express Coney Island in Royal Oak, Michigan. The target was a Dodge Challenger Hellcat, which is so often the case. After breaking out the window, the thieves weren’t able to get the Mopar muscle car started, so they fled. The owner was probably pretty relieved his ride wasn’t stolen, unlike so many others."

Considering they had a gun they proved they were willing to use, you’d think they would’ve taken the Hellcat without resistance at that point. We’re guessing they realized they couldn’t get it started easily and with gunfire the cops would be at the scene quickly."

Thankfully, these guys obviously aren’t good marksmen, but they were desperate and/or foolish enough to use a gun during the incident. The longer this car theft spree goes unchecked, the more likely thieves will get the idea that just taking cars from people at gunpoint is a good way to go about business."
