That's when one unmasked driver in a Hellcat Challenger laid down some rubber in a big smokey burnout while waiting in line with other stolen vehicles to make their grand escape. In yet another video, one of the stolen Hellcat Challengers can be seen drifting around performing burnouts and donuts as his passenger hangs out of the window. ",
