<p>In response to Nintendo’s recent stock decline from E3, former Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima stated that Nintendo have yet to reveal their full lineup of games for the remainder of 2018.</p>
<p>Kimishima says that Nintendo are waiting to reveal their full lineup to customers when the time is right. As Nintendo generally march to the beat of their own drum, this shouldn’t be too surprising. But it is nice to know that there is more coming than we had originally anticipated.</p>
