With real estate prices absolutely rocketing out of control in the Phoenix area as the city continues to grow by leaps and bounds, the Gila River Indian Community hatched a plan to raze the motorsports park and replace it with a sports and entertainment district with restaurants, retail spaces, sports facilities, parks, and an office complex. Mind you, there’s already a casino and mall just down the road, not to mention restaurants and retail on the other side of I-10. This redevelopment plan was supposed to be put into action several years down the road, maybe as far into the future as a decade. That all changed when Wild Horse Pass suddenly let the cat out of the bag, announcing the facilities would be closing within a year.",
