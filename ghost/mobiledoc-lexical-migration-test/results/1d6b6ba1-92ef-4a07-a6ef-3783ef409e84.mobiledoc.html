<p>2017 marked the end for <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">Dodge’s</a> long running halo car and they wanted it to go out with a bang. To send the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/motorious-readers-can-win-this-dream/">Viper</a> off while commemorating its reign as the greatest supercar in American automotive history, <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">Dodge made five</a> unique special editions. Each of these special edition models were made to pay homage to the <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">Viper’s</a> greatest achievements from the past 25 years.</p>

<p>On June 24, 2016 <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">Dodge started</a> taking orders and within two days, each one of the 217 <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">limited edition Vipers</a> were spoken for. For those not fortunate enough to have been so quick to reserve theirs, the good news is that these limited editions were offered in addition to the Viper’s regular production and since as previously stated Dodge wanted to make the last year of the model special, the goal didn’t end with a limited production run. In fact, even a normal production <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">Viper</a> was capable of being just as highly optioned as any of the five limited edition versions if ordered that way.</p>

<p>With 16,000 exterior color variations, 24,000 custom stripe colors, 11 wheel options, 16 interior trims, seven aero packages, three brake packages, and four suspension options there were an estimated 50 million different ways to configure a 2017 Dodge Viper. What that means today, now that the chance to order a brand new Viper is gone, is that the chances of seeing two <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">2017 Dodge Vipers</a> that are configured exactly the same is very unlikely making these cars highly collectible.</p>

<p><a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20709">Vicari Auctions</a> is offering a highly optioned example of a 2017 Dodge Viper in White. Although it lacks any of the intricate details of the stripe packages that Dodge offered in 2017, the simple white and black color scheme is very fitting. This particular example is equipped with the highly desirable aero package complete with the enormous front and rear spoilers. While there is not a whole lot of information about the car, it does appear to be in good condition so if you are in the market for a 2017 Dodge Viper this could be your chance.
