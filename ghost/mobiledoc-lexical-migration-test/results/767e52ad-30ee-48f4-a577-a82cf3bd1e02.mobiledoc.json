One of the main proponents of this was the 911, a vehicle that still serves the brand to this day. Performance is the name of the game for anyone who buys these cars which is exactly why they were so good at their job when they first came out. One great example of this is the GT3 you see "

          "First of all, there is the body. The designers clearly had style and aerodynamics in mind when they created it. Along with that performance-oriented design, it also keeps very close to the originally planned body lines and design-language that made it so iconic in the first few years of the model. On top of that, the suspension was optimized from the factory for hard cornering abilities and more than enough sturdiness to deter body roll. With all of these things in mind, you might be able to see how the cars essentially became race cars for the road but there is one very important piece we haven't discussed yet. You could be the next caretaker of this great Porsche if you are the winning bidder."

Luckily, the driver of this vehicle will have access to a beautiful 4.0-liter enigne whose weight distribution and placement creates a very unique handling profile. Finally, there is the six-speed manual transaxle and mechanical rear differential lock for maximum power transfer and turning agility. All of these things made the Porsche one of the best sports cars of the time so it makes sense that you might consider it for your next automotive purchase."
