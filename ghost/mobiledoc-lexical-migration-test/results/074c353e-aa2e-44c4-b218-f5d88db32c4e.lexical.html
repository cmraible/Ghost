<hr>
<p>There's no questioning how much of a role the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1990-chevrolet-corvette-zr-1-time-capsule/">C4 Corvette ZR-1</a> played in the future development of subsequent Corvette models, but two <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/spot-the-differences-on-a-c4-zr-1/">ZR-1</a> prototypes in particular are responsible for laying the ground work for future 'Vettes. Built in response to Chrysler's introduction of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-dodge-viper/">Dodge Viper</a> in 1989, the ZR-1 SS prototypes – aptly nicknamed the Snake Skinners – were experimental cars used to help push the Corvette's performance threshold ever further than the stock ZR-1.</p>
<p>Snake Skinner I was previously on a temporary loan to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/national-corvette-museum-reopens/">National Corvette Museum</a> before GM's bankruptcy, and now the other example, Snake Skinner II, will be on permanent display due to its donation by the previous owner who passed away in 2015.</p>

<p>While the ZR-1 SS never made it into production, Corvette engineers continued to develop these prototypes until the end of the C4's life cycle helping to test performance elements for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-c5-corvette-redesign/">C5 Corvette</a> such as aluminum chassis components, titanium exhaust, magnesium wheels and carbon brakes. The coolest part about this prototype is the side-pipe exhaust, which is both a nod to early high-performance Corvettes as well as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1992-dodge-viper/">first-gen Viper</a>.</p>
<p>GM sold off many of the vehicles from its Heritage Center in 2009 including both Snake Skinner prototypes. Snake Skinner I was sold to Rick Hendrick, who still retains possession of this car today, and Snake Skinner II was purchased by car-collector Greg Mauzy at Barrett-Jackson's 2009 Scottsdale auction event for $73,700.</p>
<p>According to the National Corvette Museum, Mauzy had purchased 26 other vehicles from GM's collection and he had amassed a personal collection of around 150 cars including 80 Corvettes. Sadly, he passed away in 2015, but his Corvette-loving legacy will live on through the donation of this ZR-1 SS and another Corvette prototype to the NCM.</p>
