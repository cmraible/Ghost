They’re turning to violent carjackings where victims are often killed for their ride. But one man in Dearborn Heights, Michigan didn’t wait to become a statistic, instead running over one of two carjackers while the other one fired several shots at the victim."

We can’t see in the grainy surveillance footage what happened, but it probably involved the suspect pointing a gun at the victim and demanding the truck. That’s when the victim took matters into his own hands, reversing hard and fast, running over the would-be carjacker."
