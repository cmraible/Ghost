<p>Classic Japanese cars are just beginning to get their due in the collector car marketplace. A select few, however, got a head start. Datsun 510s and early Z cars have been desirable for a long time, and Toyota's early Land Cruisers and trucks have maintained <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a loyal following</a> since they were new.</p>

<p>These <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Toyota trucks</a> have a stellar reputation for reliability that persists to the present day. Some of these trucks have been documented to last for hundreds of thousands of miles in some remarkably harsh environments.</p>
<p>But what would happen if you had the chance to buy one of these <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">classic Toyota trucks</a> with low mileage, in great condition? Would you jump at the opportunity? We know that several people would – remember, these trucks have a downright rabid fan base.</p>

<p>We found <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this 1987 Toyota 4Runner</a> at Motorgroup Auto Gallery in Scottsdale, Arizona. It's one of the nicest examples of the breed we have ever seen, by a long shit.</p>
<p>With just under 62,000 miles, this doesn't look like a nearly quarter-century old truck. Instead, it looks like it could have been built just a couple of years ago. As the ad states, "<a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">It’s as if time stood still.</a>"</p>

<p>We would heartily agree with that sentiment. The <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">gorgeous brown paint</a>, gold striping, and tan interior all look amazing. Even the wheels look untouched by the endless forward march of time.</p>
<p>Of course, perfection doesn't come cheap. If you want to own what may be the <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1987-toyota-4runner#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">nicest original 4Runner</a> left in the world, be prepared to pay dearly. With an asking price of $43,995, it's unlikely that this 4Runner will ever see daily use again. We hope it remains pampered and perfect in the years to come.</p>
