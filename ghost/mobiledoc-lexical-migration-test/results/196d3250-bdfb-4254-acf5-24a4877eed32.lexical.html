<p>In case you didn’t catch our previous article, Sarasota Classic Car Museum says <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sarasota-classic-car-museum/">it’s getting evicted</a> from its facility by the end of June. Now, a report from Patch says the Florida <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/must-see-car-museuma/">museum</a> was the victim of a car theft. As they say, when it rains it pours.</p>

<p>The Sarasota Police Department told Patch it received a report of a vehicle theft on June 14 at 9:30 am. Multiple reports from local news agencies claim the theft took place at about 2 am and that the vehicle stolen was a 1977 Porsche 911.</p>
<p>We wish there was more information about the car, but no report goes deeper than that. As enthusiasts, we’re asking everyone to keep an eye peeled for the Porsche 911 and hopefully it gets returned to its rightful owner.</p>
<p>Those reports claim the classic Porsche, which should be worth a tidy sum depending on its spec, was on loan and isn’t property of the museum. It’s common practice for car museums to take loaner vehicles with a contract spelling out liabilities, etc.</p>
<p>Curator Blake Godbey told WWSB he’s focusing on tracking down the car and ensuring more thefts aren’t committed in the future. We’d really hate to see car museums targeted like how dealerships have been, with thieves breaking in during the middle of the night and taking whatever vehicles they please.</p>
<p>The car theft trend that’s been sweeping all over North America and elsewhere in the world is beyond tiresome. Thieves seem to target anything they think can be unloaded for a buck, including classic cars. This is yet another reminder to all readers that have a beloved vehicle it’s not too late to take extra steps to secure it. Trust us, thieves want your ride so don’t wait until they get it to do something to stop them.</p>
