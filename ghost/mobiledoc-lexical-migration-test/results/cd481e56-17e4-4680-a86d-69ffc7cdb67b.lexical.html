<p>A dark money group created by allies of President Joe Biden released an ad last month thanking Sen. Kyrsten Sinema for pushing to lower prescription drug prices — just before she told the White House she will oppose Democrats’ drug pricing plan.</p>
<p>While Sinema <a href="https://twitter.com/kyrstensinema/status/972146454381830145?lang=en">previously campaigned on a pledge</a> to reduce drug costs, the freshman senator and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/kyrsten-sinemas-swamp-tale/">one-time-progressive-turned-corporatist</a> has emerged as the chief roadblock to Democrats’ plan to allow Medicare to use its bulk purchasing power to negotiate significantly lower prescription drug prices. Because Democrats hold a narrow 50-50 majority in the Senate, they cannot afford to lose any votes on the measure.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>In early August, Building Back Together, a nonprofit <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro-biden-group-donors-disclosure-c8fc8ea3-9741-4734-94d5-99568814bd0e.html">created</a> to support Biden’s agenda, announced it was launching a $10 million ad campaign to build support for Democrats’ infrastructure plans while lawmakers were out of town on a long summer recess period.</p>
<p>“The goal, officials said, was to bombard the home districts of members of Congress with ads — both televised and digital — to keep the pressure on to follow through on their votes as well as to underscore much of the agenda’s popularity with the public,” the <em>Associated Press</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-coronavirus-pandemic-a7a4e1d91bdca473baab319778851c52">reported</a> at the time.</p>
<p>One of the ads released by Building Back Together thanked Sinema and her counterpart, Sen. Mark Kelly, for working to reduce drug prices.</p>
<p>“President Biden and Sens. Kelly and Sinema delivered for us,” the ad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3jbid0Uoqo">says</a>. “They've pulled our economy back from the brink, and now they're fighting to create millions of good-paying jobs and lower the costs of health care, child care and prescription drugs. Thanks Sens. Kelly and Sinema for delivering for Arizona.”</p>

<p>Clearly, the ad campaign failed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sinema <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/19/kyrsten-sinema-biden-drug-pricing-prescription-plan-512907">informed</a> the White House of her opposition to the drug pricing plan, days after a Big Pharma-funded front group <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">started running television, radio, and digital ads</a> calling her a "bipartisan leader" and a “independent voice for Arizona.” The front group has already spent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/its-always-a-battle-against-corruption/">roughly $600,000</a> boosting Sinema on the Arizona airwaves, according to data from AdImpact.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Over the course of her career, Sinema <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/kyrsten-sinema/industries?cid=N00033983&cycle=CAREER&type=I">has raised</a> more than $500,000 from donors in the pharmaceutical and health products industries, according to OpenSecrets.</p>
<p>Now, Sinema is <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/09/20/scoop-sinema-issues-ultimatum-to-biden-494397">threatening</a> to tank both infrastructure bills — the bipartisan, industry-friendly deal she helped negotiate and Democrats’ broader $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending package meant to fund Biden’s economic, health, and climate agenda — if Democrats don’t pass her bill first.</p>
