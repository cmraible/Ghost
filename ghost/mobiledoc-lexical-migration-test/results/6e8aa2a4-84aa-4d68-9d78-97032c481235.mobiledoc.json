This high-performance sports car used the latest aerodynamic innovations, something that gave the model its distinctive wedge shape. It was actually an evolution of another experimental car from 1966, but the advances in design over three years were clear to see."

This new four-rotor variant was more polished with a sophisticated design that appeared close to production ready. Speculation began that the C 111 would be a modern-day successor to the legendary 300 SL of the 1950s."
