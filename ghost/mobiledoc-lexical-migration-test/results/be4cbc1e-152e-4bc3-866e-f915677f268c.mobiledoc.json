          "On the night of November 17, a custom 2008 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide and trailer hearse were stolen from Tanzyus-Logan Funeral Home in Decatur, Illinois. The unique combination used as the final ride for many enthusiasts over the years has become fairly famous across the country and even internationally. That, combined with the bespoke construction, made it an odd thing to steal since it would be difficult to sell without drawing suspicion."

After the suspects fled for a fair distance, an officer successfully used spike strips. Eventually, the suspects stopped the truck they were in. However, instead of doing the sensible thing at that point, they decided making a run for it on foot was a good idea. After a brief search they were located and arrested, proving they weren’t that good at hide and seek."
