<p>Good things are happening! The Colorado legislature banned dangerous so-called “forever chemicals” used in fossil fuel mining, Starbucks workers in thirteen states voted to unionize, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is cracking down on employers that put their workers in debt, New York’s legislature finally reined in crypto mining, and socialists in France are on the cusp of a big comeback.</p>

<h3 id="colorado-cracks-down-on-pfas">Colorado Cracks Down on PFAS</h3>
<p>On June 3, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed legislation into law that would ban the use of PFAS chemicals in fracking operations in the state. PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals,” are used in an enormous amount of products and processes, from no-stick pans to firefighting foam. While it’s not as good as a full fracking ban, the move is an important step forward to reducing human exposure to PFAS, which have been <a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/bad-chemistry/">linked</a> to cancer, thyroid disease, obesity, and ulcerative colitis. Sarah Doll, the national director of Safer States, a coalition that works on chemical and toxic policy, <a href="https://www.ehn.org/pfas-fracking-2657471451.html">said</a> in a statement: “This law puts Colorado at the forefront of states taking action to stop the flow of toxic PFAS chemicals… We anticipate other states to continue this trend.” While New York, Maryland, and Washington have banned fracking, Colorado is the first state to ban PFAS in fracking while keeping fracking legal.</p>

<p>The <em>Minneapolis Star-Tribune </em>flagged a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/brooks-in-a-twist-lets-go-brandon-helps-a-boy-let-go-of-his-fears/600178645/">heartwarming story</a> of a local African-American 9-year-old boy with autism named Brandon Brundridge, who was visiting friends at an RV park in Texas when he spotted some <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/10/lets-go-brandon-meaning-nascar-republicans-joe-biden.html">coded anti-Biden signs</a> declaring, “Let's Go Brandon” — and thought the posters were supporting him. As the article noted, “Encouraged by the signs, Brandon found his courage. The training wheels came off. He took the plunge into the pool, even though the water looked pretty cold and there was a very real possibility it might go up his nose. He walked around that RV park with his head held high, feeling like a celebrity.” His mother, a children’s book author, is writing a new book on Brandon’s experience called <em>Brandon Spots His Sign</em>.</p>
<h3 id="barista-brewdown">Barista Brewdown</h3>
<p>There have been three certainties this year: death, taxes, and Starbucks workers kicking company CEO Howard Schultz’s ass. The decrepit Schultz, whose own colossal self-regard forced him in 2022 out of a comfortable retirement, is now getting humiliated daily by 19-year-old baristas with piercings, BTS tattoos, and a strong desire to unionize. Over the past week, the Starbucks CEO was dealt union victories in stores in Connecticut, New York, Washington, Oregon, Kansas, Tennessee, Illinois, California, Michigan, Alabama, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas. In total, Starbucks workers have now voted to unionize in <a href="https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1534327010780139520?cxt=HHwWgMCy7a-Sg8sqAAAA">135</a> locations — a number that’s grown by more than 30 percent just since the beginning of June<em>. </em>In an interview Friday with Wall Street sycophant Andrew Ross Sorkin, Schultz <a href="https://twitter.com/greenhousenyt/status/1535324804508704774">pledged</a> to never engage with the union, saying he would refuse to bargain in good faith with the workers. We’ll see how that works out for him — and for Starbucks’ Chairwoman <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-union-workers-money-funds-a-union-buster/">Mellody Hobson</a>, whose investment company receives a big chunk of income from union pension funds..</p>
<h3 id="regulators-drill-into-employer-driven-debt">Regulators Drill Into Employer-Driven Debt</h3>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has begun investigating the problem of employer-driven debt, which is when workers go into debt for their employer, typically to pay for supplies, training, or subcontracting. The agency is <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-launches-inquiry-into-practices-that-leave-workers-indebted-to-employers/">seeking</a> workers’ experiences with such debt and employers’ attempts to collect on it, with the goal of cracking down on company abuses.</p>
<h3 id="new-york-takes-on-crypto">New York Takes On Crypto</h3>
<p>New York’s hopelessly compromised legislative leaders knew that they couldn’t leave environmentalists high and dry after <a href="https://grist.org/politics/a-push-for-public-power-stalled-in-new-york-but-activists-say-theyre-just-getting-started/">killing</a> renewable <a href="https://publicpowerny.org/legislation/">public power</a> legislation on June 3. So on the same day, they passed very good legislation to reign in crypto mining. Electricity in upstate New York tends to be very cheap, and so crypto miners, which use powerful computers to create new crypto coins for sale, have flocked to the state since China <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/04/crypto-banned-china-other-countries/">cracked down</a> on the industry in 2021. The result has been enormous new electricity consumption in the region, including from fossil fuels — a total climate disaster. The new legislation puts a two-year moratorium on new crypto mining if the electricity for the operation comes from fossil fuels. A crypto executive <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/heres-whats-in-new-yorks-new-bitcoin-mining-ban-.html#:~:text=New%20York%20just%20passed%20a,here%27s%20everything%20that%27s%20in%20it&text=Lawmakers%20in%20New%20York%20just,into%20law%20or%20veto%20it">told</a> CNBC that “New York is setting a bad precedent that other states could follow.” Let’s hope so.</p>
