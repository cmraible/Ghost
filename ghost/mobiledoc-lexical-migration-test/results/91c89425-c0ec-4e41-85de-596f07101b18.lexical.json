These sleek beasts are terrifying with an excellent black paint job and low-profile racing tires, but sometimes you need something more flamboyant. That's exactly where this car comes in as it sports a paint job you might only expect from a particular Italian brand with a similar affection for the color red. With nearly 55 years of racing pedigree under its belt, this is a stunning sight to behold on any street, track, or car show. The car could be yours with a simple click of a button, but first, let's talk about some of its more prominent attributes. See more ",

Models like the F12, F40, and 250 GTO will live on in the history books as some of the European circuit's most fearsome competitors on land. Notice how we said \"on land\" because there is another type of vehicle that the pressing pony of Italy tried their hand at once or twice in the past. Of course, we are not talking about airplanes or spaceships. Instead, this particular vehicle is a sturdy sea-going vessel with all the power of a racing-inspired sports car and the looks of Ferrari's best designers. This is a truly impressive sports boat, and any water sailing enthusiast will be thrilled for the opportunity to own it. See more ",
