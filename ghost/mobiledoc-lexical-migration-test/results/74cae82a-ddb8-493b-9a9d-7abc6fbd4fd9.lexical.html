<p>In advance of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-meltdown-podcast-series-live-chat-on-11-30/">tonight’s <em>Daily Poster</em> live event</a> about the hit <a href="https://adbl.co/meltdown">podcast series <em>MELTDOWN</em></a>, Sirota sat down with Foo Fighters’ guitarist Chris Shiflett for an in-depth discussion about how today’s Democrats seem intent on repeating the history that originally helped Donald Trump ascend to the presidency. The wide-ranging discussion looked back at Democrats defending Wall Street after the financial crisis, and how that behavior echoes modern-day Democrats constantly defending the corporate donor class — a phenomenon that threatens to boost Republicans ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.</p>
<p>“There’s a direct line from Barack Obama receiving the most amount of money from Wall Street and him getting into office and making sure that Wall Street was not held accountable — and if you acknowledge those facts, you’re acknowledging the inherent contradiction of the Democratic party, which is the tension between telling voters we want to help you and telling donors we’re going to help you,” Sirota told Shiflett. “If you keep the working class starved of resources and you make public spectacles of giving the wealthy lots of resources, what do you expect is gonna happen?"</p>
