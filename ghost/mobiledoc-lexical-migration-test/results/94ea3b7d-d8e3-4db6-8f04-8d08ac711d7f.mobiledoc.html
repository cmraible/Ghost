<p><a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1970-chevelle-ss">This 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS</a> is nothing short of a muscle car masterpiece and it is exactly as it was intended to be. It features its 396-cid big block engine that was installed while the car was still new, an original paint code finish, and an expertly executed restoration. Backing the big block powerhouse is a Muncie M20 4-speed manual transmission that feeds into a 12-bolt rear end with positraction and a 3.31:1 gear ratio. Running over the top of a functional cowl-induction hood is a pair of black stripes and the correct <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1970-chevelle-ss">Super Sport</a> badging finishes off the classic original look. This bold look could not be pulled off so well with any other color than Cranberry Red.</p>

<p>With only half of the planned production being produced in 2020 and 2021 not doing much better, the demand for these stunning <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">new Corvettes</a> far outweighs the supply. This can make it really hard for the enthusiast to find the right Corvette for the right price. However, if you win one you don’t have to worry about price and you don’t have to worry about settling for a lower optioned example either. Thanks to <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">Ronald McDonald House Central Valley</a> you now have that opportunity.</p>
