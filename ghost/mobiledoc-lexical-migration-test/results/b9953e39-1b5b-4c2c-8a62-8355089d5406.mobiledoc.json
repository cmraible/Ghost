Launched as a package for the F-85 and Cutlass in 1964, the name originally stood for a 4bbl carb, four-speed transmission, and dual exhaust system. In 1965 the significance of the name changed when Olds adopted a 400ci V8, making the 442 a hot muscle car. Thanks to surging sales, the 442 was made a standalone model in 1968, lasting through 1972."
