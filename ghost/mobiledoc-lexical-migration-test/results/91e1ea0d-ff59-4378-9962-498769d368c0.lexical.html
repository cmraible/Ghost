<p>Workers at a nearby strip mall said they see cars speeding through and revving often. Megan Streater was working the night of the crash, and the whole ordeal is still stuck with her.</p>
<p>“It was just like an astronomical boom like a bomb went off and that is when all the power got cut and then we only saw smoke outside of our window and what I pieced together really quickly was like a bomb went off,” said Streater. “It didn’t sound like screeching or a collision, like classic car accident sounds. It was just a huge boom.”</p>
