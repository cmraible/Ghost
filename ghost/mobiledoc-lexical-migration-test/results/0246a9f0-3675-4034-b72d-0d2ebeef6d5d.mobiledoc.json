What really makes this 1978 Bronco collectible is its overall condition that is super clean everywhere you look thanks to a comprehensive restoration. Not only was the Bronco painted in its original yellow color, but the interior, undercarriage and engine compartment are ready to show. As the bright yellow paint job carries over into the cabin, the extensive brown interior is a flashback to the 1970s, and it all looks as clean and straight as the Bronco's exterior."

To power those monster 33x12.50-inch BFGoodrich tires, this Bronco has upgraded to a 400 cubic-inch V8 with a mild cam and a dual Flowmaster exhaust that belts out a glorious note. The engine mates to a four-speed manual transmission, and the truck is sure to be a perfect cruiser thanks to power steering, power disc front brakes and ice-cold air conditioning."
