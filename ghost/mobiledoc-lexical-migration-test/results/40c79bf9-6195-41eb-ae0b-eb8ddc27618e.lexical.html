<p>Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg were automakers that built vehicles for pure luxury. The cars were not mass produced on an assembly line like many others as each one was hand-assembled. Appropriately, the museum is located where the old Auburn Automobile Company's former headquarters once was in Auburn, Indiana. All three of auto companies closed up shop back in 1937, and the museum opened up on July 6th, 1974. The museum houses 140 vintage and antique vehicles and draws in over 40,000 visitors a year. In fact, the museum is a National Historic Landmark as it was named by the U.S. National Parks Service in 2005. Making a donation to the museum - that will enter you into the sweepstakes to win one <a href="https://auburncordmuseum.tapkat.org/wina1963corvettestingray?promo=M5">gorgeous classic Corvette</a> - will ensure that many will be able to enjoy this place for years to come.</p>
