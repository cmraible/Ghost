That time was the 1980s, an era defined by boxy body kits and sleek sports car styling. On top of that, it’s easy to see how some of the world’s best super, sport, and racing vehicles came from the ‘80s. This Porsche is a perfect example as it boasts some of the best tech and performance you can find in a 911."
