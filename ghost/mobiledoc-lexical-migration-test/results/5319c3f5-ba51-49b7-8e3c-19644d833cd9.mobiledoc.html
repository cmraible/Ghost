<h2 id="why-the-question-mark-enables-campaign-tracking">Why the question mark enables campaign tracking</h2>
<p>The question mark symbol is very useful thing in analytics. You can append anything to an URL, simply by putting a question mark on the end. For example:</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/11/how-analytics-imact-journalists-sense-of-newsworthiness/">https://onemanandhisblog.com/2019/11/how-analytics-imact-journalists-sense-of-newsworthiness/</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/11/how-analytics-imact-journalists-sense-of-newsworthiness/?=twitter-share">https://onemanandhisblog.com/2019/11/how-analytics-imact-journalists-sense-of-newsworthiness/?=twitter-share </a></p>
<p>both lead to the same page. But the additional element in the URL on the second link means you can separate the traffic from the two. They show up as separate links in your analytics, and you can search for the addition ("?=twitter-share" in this case - but it can be anything you want as long as it starts with a “?”) to see the impact of your Twitter sharing (for instance).</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-useful">Why is this useful?</h2>
<p>Your web analytics is really good at tealling you where your traffic is coming from in the Acqustion section. What it's not so good at it telling you how much of that traffic is coming directly from your own sharing activities. Yes, you can look to social or newsletter analytics to uderstand that. For example, if you publish a newsletter, most platforms have click tracking, that tell you how many people followed a link in the newsletter back to your site. But if they then share that link on Twitter, you won't know that the traffic that comes via that social share has its roots in your original email.</p>
<p>Because campaign tracking data travles with the URL, it allows you to follow the impact of that singual sharing activity, never mind how far it goes. So, you publish the newsletter, and someone clicks on the link. She likes what she sees, and so shares it in the company Slack. Many people click on the link there, and then one of them decides to post it on LinkedIn. Even more traffic comes from that link, and one of the people who sees the story there then shares it on Twitter, attracting even more clicks. Cmapiagn tracking allows you to attribute <em>all</em> that traffic back to the first share.</p>
<p>It's a fantastic way of knowing where your promotional activity is having an impact — and where it isn't. </p>
<h2 id="utm-tracking">UTM Tracking</h2>
<p>Google Analytics introduced a specific language of campaign tracking that's been widely adopted by many other analytics software, too. It breaks down the URL additions into distinct categories, that allows you to analyse indivdual link shares, or a combination  of them. The major codes are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Source</strong> — the platform you shared the link on, so Twitter, Pinterest, etc, or a specific newsletter (morning briefing, afternoon roundup)</li>
    <li><strong>Medium — </strong>the broad category, so social, newsletter and so on</li>
    <li><strong>Content (optional)</strong> — generally used for A/B testing two versions of the same share</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign</strong> — a specific name for the experiement you're running, like “morning share”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then head into the Campaign section of Google Analytics (or other analytics platforms) and see the impact of your work. </p>
