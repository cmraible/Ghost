Of course, at the heart of this car is the turbo EJ20G flat-four engine, which for its small size whips out a nice 230-horsepower. Mated to the symmetrical all-wheel drive and a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission, that engine really rockets this rally car forward with ferocity. It also sticks turns like it’s nailed to the ground, which is why the WRX is so legendary today."
