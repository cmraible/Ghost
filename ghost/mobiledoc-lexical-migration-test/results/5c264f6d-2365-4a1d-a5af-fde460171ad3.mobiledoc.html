I’ve had a lot of succcess with soups, so I had a nice chicken stock simmering away as the sun slowly set down, orange light filtering over the field behind the house.</p>
<p>I never seem to get the time to really cook, and by �really cook� I mean from basic ingredients upwards, so a few hours just pottering around in a good-sized kitchen was bliss.</p>
<p>Slightly more detail than you normally get for a token photo post, I know, but I do like to share�</p>
