<p>Amidst all the bad news, we need something positive to look to - after several weeks of dealing with the different aspects of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/covid19-industry-disruptor/">COVID-19</a>, where do we drive? Metaphorically, emotionally, and literally, were do we downshift and steer to shoot the gap?</p>
<p>From isolating mandatory shelter-in-place orders, to toilet paper shortages, to adapting to remote work environments, and the broadening uncertainty about the economy, nobody is untouched.</p>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/now-could-be-the-perfect-covid-19-cannonball-run/">car community</a> has done what the car community is known to do, and that is band together around a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/national-corvette-museum-online-car-show/">common goal</a> to promote a positive outlook. The following videos are examples of the passion around our hobby. Please bookmark them share them with your fellow gearheads who need a reminder that, even though we are driving apart for the first time ever, we are driving together. </p>
