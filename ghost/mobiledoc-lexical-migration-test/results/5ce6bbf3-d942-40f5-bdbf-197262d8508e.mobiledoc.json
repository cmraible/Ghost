          "Dave Fischbach was a well-known quantity in classic Corvette circles, considering his beautiful 1960 Chevy Corvette had racked up a number of accolades, including winning at the National Corvette Show three times. Even with all that fame and success, the man and his famous ride weren’t immune to a plague which has spread across the land. Five years ago he left the Holiday Inn where he was staying in Southgate, Michigan only to find someone had stolen his C1 Corvette."

          "The prize-winning car, which Fischbach had poured countless hours into customizing just so, had been sitting inside a 40-foot trailer, supposedly safe. However, the thieves stole the trailer and the Ford F-450 it was hitched up to. Instead of triumphantly showing off his beloved ‘Vette at the 2017 Detroit Autorama, the man was filing a police report and hoping for the best."

A Jeep Wrangler which was also in the trailer was found elsewhere with signs the thieves tried to burn it. Then police finally located ’60 Corvette, which had been stripped of most of its parts, the fiberglass body cut into three different pieces. The thieves scattered those pieces at three different sites in the Detroit area, burning each one."

          "Understandably, Fischbach said he was devastated by the theft and cruel destruction of the Corvette. It shocked the man so badly he took a break from restoring cars, something he had enjoyed since he was a teen. In mourning, he started selling off his collection, but his family talked him into not making rash decisions."

          "Now, Fishback is back into the hobby. The man has held onto several valuable, rare cars from his collection, vehicles which he absolutely treasures. But he likely still feels a hole in his heart for the 1960 Corvette which gained so much notoriety. This does show that even after a devastating loss of a car, we enthusiasts can bounce back and feel passion for the hobby once more, even if we have to take a break for a while."
