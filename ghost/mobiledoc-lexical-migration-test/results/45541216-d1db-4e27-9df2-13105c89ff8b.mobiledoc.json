          "Marketed by Buick as a personal luxury car, the Buick Riviera was produced from 1963 until 1999 (with the exception of 1994). A first in the personal luxury car market for General Motors, the car was applauded and highly praised by automotive journalists when it debuted. This new luxury car was designed from the ground up and was the first to sit upon GM's E-platform. Even more, it was Buick's first unique Riviera model. Early models didn't stray far from original form, but eight generations spawned and varied in style and size. In fact, a grand total of 1,127,261 Rivieras were produced. Available through "

While dual exhaust was offered as standard, one cool feature on this Riviera is a custom exhaust system that exits just ahead of the rear tires. The Riviera was also front engine-powered and rear-wheel-drive (up until 1979) unlike its E-platform siblings, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado. "
