<p>People in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nashville-police-bust-street-racers/">Nashville, Tennessee</a> area were shocked to learn that a car crash on March 5 which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-kills-innocent-driver/">killed</a> a 71 year-old man was caused by a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/teen-solves-27-year-mystery/">13 year-old</a>. The teenager was driving a Dodge Dart with passengers when he ran a red light, lost control of the car, hitting the other <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-fatal-wreck/">Dodge Challenger</a> as it was waiting to turn out of an O’Reilly Auto Parts parking lot. It’s one of those cases where you can’t help but ask a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/split-window-c8-corvette/">bunch of questions</a> right away. Now, answers to some of those questions are coming in.</p>

<p>One of the biggest questions was why the teen was driving since he isn’t legally able to do so. Well, Nashville police have identified 37 year-old Katrina Russell as the person who sold the Dodge Dart to the 13 year-old. All she asked for the car before handing over the keys was $80.</p>

<p>Since Russell didn’t have a home or legal address on file, tracking her down was difficult. Police eventually learned she was living in a house that’s being renovated after receiving reports of people “living there without permission.”</p>
<p>After police were able to determine here identify, Russell was arrested and charged with vehicular homicide by recklessness and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>

<p>Before the fatal crash, the teen had been involved in a hit and run. It sounds like that’s why he ran the red light, then he almost hit another car, swerved, and plowed into the Dodge Challenger.</p>
<p>As for his consequences, the unnamed teen is facing quite a few. He’s been charged with vehicular homicide and recklessness, along with several other crimes. Since he’s a juvenile, he won’t be facing the potential for as serious of punishments for those crimes, if convicted. He ended up from the hospital since he was injured in the crash.</p>
