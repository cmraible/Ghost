<p>A growing number of people are beginning to realize the Porsche 996s aren’t bad cars at all, despite some purists branding them as horrible since they were the first of the water-cooled 911s. That means values could very well rise dramatically over the coming years, making this a great time to scoop this <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/2004-porsche-911_6064?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2004 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet</a> from <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/about?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Motorgroup Auto Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>One reason this 996 Turbo is such a prime acquisition target is the mere 30,279 miles showing on the odometer. It’s been lightly used and obviously has been pampered, because that Guards Red exterior and Savanna Beige full leather interior look absolutely gorgeous. The original factory equipment is still present, including the wheels and all interior controls.</p>

<p>But what makes this Porsche even more compelling are the factory extras included. The one and only owner purchased this car new from Autobahn Porsche of Forth Worth with some specific goodies. For example, it has a black canvas soft top, but there’s also a body-color removable hardtop. One update the owner had installed was a new sound system with navigation, plus an Alpine 6-CD changer, but the original radio and CD changer have been retained and are included just in case.</p>

<p>This Porsche 911 has the X50 Turbo package, which of course includes the 3.6-liter flat-six twin-turbo engine with 450-horespower on tap.</p>
<p>A Porsche Certificate of Authenticity is being offered with this car, along with the original window sticker, owner’s pouch, and Porsche air compressor. The owner has always had this car serviced by a Porsche dealer and can provide the service records, a big plus when you’re looking for an investment-grade vehicle.</p>
