A quick search will uncover many other cities are grappling with similar problems, like Kias and Hyundais accounting for one third of all car thefts in Washington, D.C. for the first three weeks of 2023. This trend is getting much worse as more kids see the social media posts, primarily on TikTok, about how to steal the cars."

A Hyundai spokesman told the station the software will be free and available as early as March. Kia informed the station the free software will be available about midway through 2023."

Sadly, we’ve learned to be skeptical about theft deterrent measures doled out by automakers after they didn’t design vehicles with robust enough systems from the get-go, so we’ll see how well this works. We also know installing the software in every affected Kia and Hyundai will be a huge undertaking since that would require going to a dealer’s service department. In other words, the Kia and Hyundai theft problem likely isn’t going away anytime soon, even with this promised fix."

They think if they remove the key from their Kia or Hyundai, turn the wheel, and it locks, that means their car cant’ be stolen. In most vehicles, there is a blinking light in the dash, usually shaped like a key, which flashes after you remove the key from the ignition, signaling that the electronic immobilizer is working. This is not the same thing as a factory steering wheel lock mechanism."
