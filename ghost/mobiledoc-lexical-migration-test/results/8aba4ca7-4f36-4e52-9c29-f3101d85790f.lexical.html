<p>Once you start paying attention to SEO, you realise how important it is to update your content online. And then, if you're smart, a little light goes off in your head, and you realise how very different digital content is from its printed equivalent. One of the great boons of the digital format is the ability to update things without having to entirely rewrite them - to see your website as a living document, not a moment in time caught in paper aspic. </p>
<p>Now, let's turn that idea around the other way: what's the price of <strong>not</strong> updating things?</p>
<p>In a pandemic, the answer is, of course, intentionally or not, you end up communicating poor, outdated information. </p>
<p>And then, as these tweets highlight, you have a problem: </p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It does seem like most orgs have poor or non-existent processes and resources to review, update and where necessary remove published content in.

<p>Six years ago, I wrote a piece on <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news-commentary/-we-haven-t-even-scratched-surface-of-explainer-journalism-/s6/a556585/">explainer journalism</a> for journalism.co.uk. We have not moved on those ideas nearly quickly enough as an industry yet. We still remain deeply attached to the idea of a rolling series of updated news stories, rather than single, updated resources. The two are not mutually exclusive, of course. The single explainer can link to the news story, and the news story back to the explainer. But are you leaving stories up on your site with outdated Covid-19 info in them? If so, are you modifying them in some way to allow people to find the more updated information? </p>
<p>If not, you <em>are</em> unintentionally contributing to misinformation. People just don't pay attention to dates when they share things. They don't. That's why <em>The Guardian</em> came up with their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2019/apr/02/why-were-making-the-age-of-our-journalism-clearer">inspired tool for flagging the published date when things are shared to Facebook</a> - a move which Facebook itself is rather belatedly following up on: </p>

<p>Interesting piece from the <em>Financial Times</em> looking how they moved from project-based teams to more durable ones. It makes perfect sense - as long as they can avoid the turf wars and stagnation that sometimes come with such a structure. </p>

<h2 id="the-lean-back-read-when-a-tweet-backfires">The Lean Back Read: when a tweet backfires</h2>
<p>Here's an admission: I always viewed the author of this piece - Marie Le Conte - as one of the performative attention farmers on Twitter, who had significantly aided her career by being actively controversial on there. She doesn't really disabuse me of that notion in this piece, and I <em>nearly</em> didn't get past the first few paragraphs where she downplays the nature of her original tweet.</p>
<p> I'm glad I persevered, though, because she does make an excellent job of tracking the dynamics of how one attention-farming tweet can lead to a far bigger crop than the poster expected.</p>
<p>And the conclusion is absolutely üëåüèº.</p>
