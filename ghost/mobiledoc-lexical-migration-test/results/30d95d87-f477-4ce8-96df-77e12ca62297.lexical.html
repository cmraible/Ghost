<p>The first car is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/571/1961-chevrolet-corvette">1961 Chevrolet Corvette</a> with a Fawn Beige paint job. Smooth brightwork, factory wheels, white wall tires, and all the correct badges make for a complete presentation. With a full restoration only 8,900 miles in the past, this car looks and drives fantastic. Tucked away under that voluptuous hood is a 283 ci V8 2x4bbl. That’s plenty for fun cruising around town or hitting the open road for a weekend getaway. A 4-speed manual transmission works smoothly to keep you happy one gear shift at a time.</p>
<p>A matching Fawn Beige interior color scheme perfectly compliments that sultry exterior. I comes with the factory setup, including all the OE controls and gauges working perfectly. The correct cream shifter knob and woven floor mats add the perfect touches.</p>
<p>Second is also a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/432/1961-chevrolet-corvette">1961 Chevrolet Corvette</a> in Fawn Beige with a matching interior. Is also looks excellent all around, even though the seller states a tire blew out on the rear driver side and damaged the quarter panel. After full repairs, including blending the paint artfully, you can’t even tell this beauty has had work done. Just like the other, this C1 ‘Vette comes with all the factory controls and gauges, plus the 283ci 2.4bbl V8.</p>
<p>Everyone knows and loves the Corvette, America’s sports car. For 1961 designers went with a big overhaul in the car’s rear, which had stayed pretty much the same since 1953. The new duck tail or tail lift rear featured four circular lights, a feature that was preserved for decades after. These monumental changes make this model year notable and quite collectible. The only question you need to answer is which of these two beautiful ‘Vettes should you add to your collection?</p>
