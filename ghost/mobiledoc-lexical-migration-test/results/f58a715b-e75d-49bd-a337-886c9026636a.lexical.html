<p><a href="https://e-tailored.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">E-Tailored</a> likes to take customer cars and turn them into far more aggressive machines. This <a href="https://e-tailored.com/vehicles/5/1967-chevelle?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">1967 Chevrolet Chevelle</a> is an excellent example of the work they do. While some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/part-2-coolest-restomods/" rel="nofollow">restomods</a> might be over-the-top in all the wrong ways, this car has a more understated look and real performance to back all that up.</p>

<p>It all starts with an appropriately sinister exterior. The body painted Rebel Grey, it’s a refreshing break from all the black paint jobs used when “murdering out” restomods and other vehicles. It also pairs exceptionally well with the matte black American Racing 10-spoke wheels with low profile tires mounted and almost no wheel gap showing. Instead of getting rid of all the chrome, a fair amount of the shiny trim is still left, keeping things from getting too dark.</p>
<p>Open the door and you’ll be shocked by the blood red interior since it’s such a contrast to the exterior. There’s a nice bench seat for all that nostalgia you crave, plus the owner wanted this to be a car he could use to take the whole family on weekend cruises. Vintage Air helps keep everyone nice and cool, but without ruining the overall aesthetic. To that same end, a new sound system was installed so that it’s hidden from view. Of course, the digital gauge cluster is a far departure from what was originally in the car, yet it looks excellent in this restomod monster.</p>
<p>If you pop the trunk, you’ll find vinyl on the sites and fresh carpeting in the bottom, making it almost as comfortable as the interior.</p>
<p>Under all that is a powder coated frame, because the E-Tailored team actually took apart the car to straighten everything out and decided to add that extra protection. It was also the perfect time to sawp in a Ridetech air suspension, which helps get those wheels tucked in just so. Wilwood disc brakes for all four wheels were also installed</p>
<p>The most important part of the project was when E-Tailored dropped a GM crate LS3 V8 with a T-56 Magnum into the car. It breathed all kinds of life into the Chevy. The valve covers are painted to match the body and the engine compartment, while a few chrome components add some highlights for refreshing contrast.</p>
<p>With an impressive and growing list of <a href="https://e-tailored.com/vehicles?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">project cars</a>, E-Tailored has a stellar reputation for creating absolute masterpieces. The company does restomods like this Chevelle, but it will also perform faithful restorations. If you really just want to black out your ride, install a body kit or aero package, go with some aggressive tuning, or have other custom work done, the shop will do <a href="https://e-tailored.com/services?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">all that and more</a>.</p>
