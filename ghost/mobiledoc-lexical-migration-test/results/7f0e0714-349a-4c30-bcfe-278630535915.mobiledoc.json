The thieves used it in a series of smash and grab thefts, stuffing it with all kinds of random items. Likely they sold or took with them anything they considered valuable, then they dumped the car on the side of the road along with everything else."

Each one is addressed to “Barbo” or “Pony” and are signed by a man named “Keith.” Whoever Keith is or was, his cursive handwriting is impeccable. As Gelhausen noted, the unlined paper looks as if the man used a ruler to keep all the words perfectly lined up in neat rows."

Rather than sort through everything and only take what seemed valuable, the thieves grabbed everything and went through it later. They probably realized there was no money in the stack of papers, so they ditched it along with the other stolen items in the car."
