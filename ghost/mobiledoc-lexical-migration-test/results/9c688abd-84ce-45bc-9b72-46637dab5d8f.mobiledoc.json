All the custom bodywork was built by hand, a process which had to be painstaking yet paid off big. Tuned to the extreme, the LSX V8 has a 10,000 rpm redline and just over 800-horsepower at the rear wheels. There’s a fully TIG-welded tube chassis to provide the necessary torsional rigidity for all that power."
