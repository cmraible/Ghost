There's still a supercharged 354 cubic-inch Hemi V8 under the hood, but this engine gets a larger Whipple supercharger, upgraded forged internal components, new front accessory driver and an aluminum ice tank that cools the supercharger's intercooler. There's a new four-link rear suspension with equally new double-adjustable coilovers at all four corners, and all of these upgrades result in the \"quickest, fastest and most powerful Dodge Challenger Mopar Drag Pak\" that Dodge has ever built."
