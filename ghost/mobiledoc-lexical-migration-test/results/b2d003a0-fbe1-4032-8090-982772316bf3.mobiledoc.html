<p>‌Friends:</p>
<p>We’re excited to unveil our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/"><strong>brand new website</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The change marks a big step in our expansion — thanks to you. But here’s the most important thing to know: <strong>As a supporting subscriber, nothing has changed for you at all.</strong></p>
<p>When we launched <em>The Daily Poster</em> in April 2020, we built it on Substack, a user-friendly newsletter platform that allowed us to focus our resources on investigative reporting. We have now grown to the point where we are ready to build a full-featured news site, and to do that, we have moved to <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, an open-source publishing platform with built-in newsletter support. On top of that, we’re running <a href="https://www.outpost.pub/">Outpost</a>, a member support and communication system built by veteran journalist and open-internet advocate Ryan Singel.</p>
<p>On the website, you will notice a new design scheme, as well as improved article recommendations. Our emails will also look a tad different, but will otherwise remain the same. And you can always email me at <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> with your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>You do not have to re-subscribe and you do not have to create a new account. Your account still exists. All of your subscription and payment information has remained in the same place on our same secure payment processor that we’ve been using all along, Stripe. You will still receive our regular emails. And as a paid subscriber, you will still have access to the full newsletter and archives; exclusive content like </strong><em><strong>Midday Poster</strong></em><strong>, the </strong><em><strong>Weekend Reader</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>You Love To See It</strong></em><strong>; and full commenting privileges.</strong></p>
<p>You will likely have to log in the first time you visit the new site in order to take advantage of your subscriber privileges. To do so, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">go to the website</a> and click on the “Login” button on the top right. You will be asked to input your email address. After doing so, you will receive an email with a link that allows you to log in. You no longer need a password to log in to your account.</p>
<p>Once you are logged in, as a supporting subscriber you will once again be able to comment on stories and reply to others. The first time you leave a comment on the new site, you’ll be asked for a name. This will be your comment name moving forward, so choose carefully. Your comment name does not have to be your real name.</p>
<p>For more information about our new site, including how to access your account and change your subscription plan, check out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/faq-about-our-new-website/">this FAQ</a> that we prepared. If you hvae any questions about the website or your account, do not hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:support@dailyposter.com">support@dailyposter.com</a>.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks and months, there will be many more changes to our site. Now that we are on Ghost, we will be building a new and dynamic digital platform to reflect our ambitious plans. Stay tuned for exciting things to come.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our team — our new website and expansion would not be possible without your support.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
