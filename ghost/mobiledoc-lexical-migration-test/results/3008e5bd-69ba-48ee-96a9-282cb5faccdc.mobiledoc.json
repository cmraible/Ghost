These will all but ensure the death of the V8 engine as automakers scramble to keep up. While the stated goal is to promote electrification, it’s more likely we’ll be getting smaller turbocharged engines which won’t be able to provide the performance many need, namely for towing and hauling heavy loads."

For comparison, the fleetwide mileage standard for the 2021 model year is 40 mpg."

That prediction seems difficult to believe, considering playing the futures market just a few months ahead can be tricky, let along projecting out almost three decades. Using these numbers, the EPA says by model year 2026 consumers would save a whopping $1,000 by buying an EV over the lifetime of their vehicle. How they define “lifetime” is probably key to understanding what this means."

The federal agency announced it plan to initiate a separate round of rulemaking for new multi-pollutant emissions standards using the Clean Air Act. Those will be aimed at 2027 model year vehicles. The whole point of this is to get cars and light trucks in the United States to zero (tailpipe) emissions per President Biden’s Executive Order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks.”"

These common practices mean a small handful of people can decide just what kinds of vehicles you’re allowed to buy in the future. They might also determine what kinds of vehicles you’re allowed to own, as some have theorized the government will be aiming to take internal combustion engines out of your cold, dead hands if necessary.
