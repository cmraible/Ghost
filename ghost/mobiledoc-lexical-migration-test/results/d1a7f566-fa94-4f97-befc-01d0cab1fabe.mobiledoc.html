<p>While former private equity executive and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/jerome-powell/">Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell</a> takes aim at workers with a pledge to ‚Äú<a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-declares-war-on-workers/">get wages down</a>‚Äù to combat inflation, he has declined to implement a law to reduce the skyrocketing paychecks of his former colleagues on Wall Street. He has also <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/regulators-should-rethink-the-way-they-assess-bank-mergers/">approved</a> and financed a <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-how-the-federal?s=r">merger wave</a> that <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-and-rep-chuy-garca-introduce-the-bank-merger-review-modernization-act-to-end-rubber-stamping-of-bank-merger-applications">critics</a><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/elizabeth-warren-fed-chair-powell-140135534.html">say</a> has inflated the cost of consumer financial services. </p>
<p>The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law mandated the creation of a rule to rein in Wall Street bonuses. The rule is supposed to be developed and implemented by six regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve that Powell runs.</p>

<p>But as he has sounded the alarm about inflation and wages, Powell has so far has done nothing to help create that rule, even as Wall Street bonuses just hit an all-time record at <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/23/success/wall-street-bonuses-for-2021/index.html">$45 billion in a single year</a>.</p>
<p>The Fed did not respond to a request for comment from <em>The Lever.</em></p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cexcessive-compensation-fees-or-benefits%E2%80%9D">‚ÄúExcessive Compensation, Fees, Or Benefits‚Äù</h3>
<p>Dodd-Frank mandates that a Wall Street compensation rule require banks to ensure that their executive compensation packages do not incentivize risky behavior, such as risky lending to hedge funds like Archegos Capital Management, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/fed-says-archegos-collapse-revealed-weaknesses-in-global-banks#xj4y7vzkg">collapsed</a> in March 2021 under the weight of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from major banks like Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>The law said the Fed and other agencies must craft a rule requiring banks to limit ‚Äúinappropriate risks‚Äù that come with providing executives with ‚Äúexcessive compensation, fees, or benefits.‚Äù</p>

<p>In 2016, five years after it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-regulation-banking-idUSKBN1A602B">supposed to be completed</a>, the Obama administration finally <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/files/agenda-items/AG20160421Item2b.pdf">proposed</a> such a rule ‚Äî but the proposal was quickly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-regulation-banking-idUSKBN1A602B">blocked</a> by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>At the time, Wall Street let its opposition to a robust rule be known. Before President Donald Trump deep-sixed it in 2017, Marc Trevino, a partner at Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, told the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>that an expansive version of the rule <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-faces-new-rules-on-pay-1458762515">would be</a> ‚Äúunfortunate and counterproductive.‚Äù</p>
<p>This past February, Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden‚Äôs nominee to be the Fed‚Äôs vice chair for supervision, promised ‚Äúto implement the law.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bloom Raskin <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-reserve-pick-sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-nomination-amid-opposition">withdrew</a> her nomination amid opposition from corporatist Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and every Republican senator.</p>
<h3 id="powell%E2%80%99s-focus-on-a-painful-path">Powell‚Äôs Focus On A Painful Path</h3>
<p>In response to rising inflation, Powell could crack down on Wall Street bonuses, call for the repeal of Trump tax cuts for the wealthy, demand the closure of the private equity tax loophole, or use the Fed‚Äôs power to block bank mergers.</p>
<p>Instead, Powell‚Äôs anti-inflation campaign has focused on raising interest rates to reduce the money supply ‚Äî a policy that tends to increase unemployment and put downward pressure on rank-and-file workers‚Äô wages.</p>
<p>The result is a much higher degree of misery for ordinary Americans, while the overall purchasing power of the country is reduced.</p>

<p>Powell and the senior Fed leadership have little connection to that suffering.</p>
<p>Powell was a senior executive at the Carlyle Group for much of his career, and his financial disclosures <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4388527-Jerome-H-Powell-Financial-Disclosure">show</a> an enormous investment portfolio worth up to <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/powell-sold-more-than-million-dollars-of-stock-as-market-was-tanking/">$55 million</a>. </p>
<p>For much of last year, the Fed was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-timeline-of-the-federal-reserves-trading-scandal-104415556.html">consumed</a> with a scandal in which Powell‚Äôs vice chair, as well as the heads of the Dallas and Boston Federal Reserve banks, were found to have engaged in insider trading.</p>
