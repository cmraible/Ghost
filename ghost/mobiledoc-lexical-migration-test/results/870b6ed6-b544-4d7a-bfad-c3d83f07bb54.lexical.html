</div>Off taking Mum to hospital for an appointment and some tests. And bored, while waiting. So, phone pic time. It’s a dull, corporate looking hospital from the outside, but inside it’s the most impressive hospital I’ve been in. Friendly, spacious, efficient and, based on Mum’s treatment, I’m very impressed.<p></p>
