And as they say, the cars that were cool when you were young stir a lot of emotion in your heart later in life because they make you feel young again. That might be why when Dennis Collins rescued this ride he was a little more chipper than usual."

While it looks like a proper British roadster from the outside, under the hood he has hidden a Ford 302 V8 for extra hard-hitting performance. Sure, our friends on the other side of the pond might find that a little blasphemous, but we like these sorts of builds."

Dragging it out in to the open with a tractor, the owner gives Collins and crew a good look at the battered little thing."

After all, Collins has restored hundreds of similar rides so this one should be looking great in short order."
