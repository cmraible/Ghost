<p>Retro sells. Dodge's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-driver-loses-control/">retro-styled Challenger</a> sells well, and it trades heavily on its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/beautiful-sunburn-1969-plymouth/">classic muscle car</a> image. It's not just successful on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/image-everything-1978-chevrolet-camaro-z28/">strength of its performance</a>.</p>
<p>Plymouth may be long gone â€“ it was officially discontinued in 2001 â€“ but many Mopar enthusiasts keep the dream alive. We've seen our share of Challenger-based 'Cuda renderings, but this is a new one for us.</p>

<p>This rendering by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wb.artist20/">wb.artist20</a> on Instagram clearly uses the current Challenger as a base. However, instead of changing it into its former stablemate, the artist chose a different Plymouth to resurrect â€“ the 1971 GTX.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/modernized-1971-plymouth-roadrunner-gtx-looks-super-sexy-from-the-back-151026.html#">Auto Evolution</a> turned us on to this awesome series of renderings. To get specific, the artist used a Dodge Challenger Hellcat widebody as the basis for their latest flight of fancy.</p>

<p>Up front, you can see the reshaped, GTX-style grille opening and Air Grabber-style hood scoop. You'll also notice the squared-off fender flares and the blacked-out roof, which resembles the vinyl roof treatments seen on many muscle cars of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Out back, the taillights were relocated lower, and the trunk opening was reshaped. As with the original, there's a large pedestal-mount wing finishing things off.</p>

I love the 72 too! Thanks to @nixtreme.rubicon I decided last minute to add the Air Grabber and two tone paint! What do yâ€™all think of it?!

<p>Overall, this rendering is subtle, with few changes overall. The Challenger underpinnings are preserved, and we can imagine this being a real option package.</p>
<p>Some renderings go over the top, creating wild dream machines that could never see the light of day. Those are cool, but we appreciate plausible concepts like these, too.</p>
<p>We'd love to see Dodge offer this package as a limited edition on the Challenger Hellcat Widebody. Besides the reshaped trunk, most of this package seems to be well within the realm of possibility. Dodge, are you listening?</p>
