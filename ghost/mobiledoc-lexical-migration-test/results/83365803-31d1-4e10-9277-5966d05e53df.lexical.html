<p>D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine has <a href="https://twitter.com/AGKarlRacine/status/1505913724913209348">sued</a> Grubhub “for misleading District residents and taking advantage of local restaurants to boost its own profits.” The company, which is owned by Dutch conglomerate Just Eat Takeaway.com, is notorious, along with its competitors DoorDash and Uber Eats, for overcharging restaurants. Racine says that the District is suing Grubhub for “failing to disclose when it charges higher prices than restaurants,” “impersonating D.C. restaurants to get more business for Grubhub,” and “advertising ‘free’ services that aren’t actually free.”</p>

<p>New Teamsters President Sean O’Brien and his running mate Fred Zuckerman have taken over the country’s largest private sector union, pledging an <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/technology/amazon-union-teamsters">aggressive</a> campaign to organize Amazon, and to take on the Teamsters’ largest employer, UPS.</p>
<p>O’Brien’s predecessor, Jimmy Hoffa Jr., notably <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/10/ups-contract-rejection-james-hoffa-hybrid-drivers">implemented</a> a hated contract in 2018 against a majority vote of the UPS membership — an incredibly rare occurrence in the U.S. labor movement.</p>
<p>O’Brien joined with reformers to eliminate the arcane rule that made the implementation possible, and has pledged an <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/22/business/new-teamsters-president-sean-obrien/index.html">aggressive</a> campaign to bring UPS to heel when the contract expires in 2023, which could include the largest strike in the country since the Teamsters last struck UPS in 1997.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the seventh and <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieson/status/1507405343739064325">eighth</a> Starbucks stores in the country became unionized on Tuesday and Friday, respectively, with another 140 stores pending, according to the <em>Huffington Post</em>’s Dave Jamieson. It’s the first Starbucks-owned <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieson/status/1506366232207020033">store</a> to go union in Starbucks’ hometown of Seattle.</p>

<p>Back in 2014, <em>The Lever</em>’s Matthew Cunningham-Cook’s wife met fearless Afro-Colombian environmental activist Francia Márquez at a small UMass Amherst event, where she came away incredibly impressed and overwhelmed by Márquez’s fortitude in standing up to death threats from the Colombian extreme right.</p>
<p>Four years later, in 2018, Márquez was <a href="https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/francia-marquez/">awarded</a> the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. The following year, she <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2019/05/goldman-prize-winner-survives-armed-attack-on-afro-colombian-social-leaders/">survived</a> an assasination attempt. In 2021, Márquez <a href="https://caracol.com.co/radio/2021/12/16/politica/1639613664_007258.html">became</a> the first Black woman to run for President of Colombia — running in the left-wing primary where she received over <a href="https://kesq.com/news/2022/03/15/francia-marquez-el-fenomeno-electoral-que-logro-la-tercera-votacion-mas-alta-en-las-consultas-internas-en-colombia/">750,000</a> votes earlier this month. Despite losing to frontrunner Gustavo Petro, Márquez received more votes than any candidate running in any other primary.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Petro, the former Mayor of Colombian capital Bogotá, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/colombia-francia-marquez-first-black-female-vice-president-candidate">tapped</a> Márquez as his vice-presidential nominee, and their ticket is now the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-60737770">odds-on</a> favorite to overcome 200 years of right-wing and center-right control of a country that is the most <a href="https://justiceforcolombia.org/news/with-22-murders-colombia-is-again-worlds-deadliest-country-for-trade-unionists/">dangerous</a> in the world for trade unionists. Amnesty International <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/americas/south-america/colombia/">says</a> Colombia is “widely recognized as the most dangerous country in the world for those who defend human rights.”</p>
<p>Unlike their opponents, Petro and Márquez are viewed as unconditional supporters of the <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/si-se-ha-cumplido-con-lo-acordado-v%C3%ADctimas-instituciones-y-paz-en/">historic</a>, yet <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/killings-colombia-ex-rebels-could-reach-1600-by-end-2024-court-2021-04-28/">unfulfilled</a>, peace deal that <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2016/santos/facts/">won</a> former President Juan Manuel Santos the Nobel Peace Prize. Petro, for his part, is running as a “Look Up” candidate, <a href="https://time.com/6139508/gustavo-petro-anti-oil-bloc/">pledging</a> to “​​speak much more strongly in a global context to fight against climate change, and to transition Latin America toward economies that are decarbonized, productive and based on knowledge,” a position that has earned him the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/165800/bogota-gustavo-petro-fossil-fuels">ire</a> of Colombia’s powerful fossil fuel sector.</p>
<h3 id="accountability-for-for-profit-colleges">Accountability for For-Profit Colleges</h3>
<p>The Department of Education has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/business/for-profit-colleges-education-department.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes">announced</a> that it will hold companies that own certain private colleges financially responsible if their schools defraud students or shut down. In theory, when schools shut down, they are responsible for repaying the federal student loan debts of students impacted. However, for years, owners have <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/03/education-department-cracks-down-on-private-equity-firms-that-own-colleges-00019487">escaped liability</a> because their schools are bankrupt. This has put the burden on taxpayers, who have suffered billions in losses from schools abruptly shuttering.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is trying to remedy the situation, requiring guarantees on a rolling basis from schools signing or renewing agreements that permit them to get federal student loans. Companies with “substantial control” over schools will be required to sign the agreements, which will make them responsible for the debt if their school fails.</p>
<p>Welcome as the news is, we’re still hoping for full cancellation of student debt!</p>

<p><em>Don’t Look Up</em>, the comet-disaster movie written by <em>The</em><em>Lever</em> founder David Sirota and Adam McKay lampooning our society’s response to climate change, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/awards-insider-wga-awards-winners-coda-dont-look-up">won</a> the Writers Guild of America award for Best Original Screenplay. David and Adam are heading to the Oscars and we wish them luck!</p>
<p>In other related news, there is a fascinating new discovery about the asteroid that crashed into Mexico’s northern Yucatán peninsula 66 million years ago and killed the dinosaurs. Scientists have long sought to explain exactly how the impact was related to the mass extinction, and a new study may offer some answers. Researchers have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dinosaur-extinction-asteroid-sulphur-cooling-b2042836.html">found</a> that the impact released enough sulfur aerosols into the planet’s atmosphere to rearrange the biosphere, leading to prolonged global cooling that contributed to dinosaur extinction.</p>
<p>We have more dinosaur-related discoveries for you too! New research <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/world/spinosaurus-aquatic-dinosaurs-scn/index.html">suggests</a> that the spinosaurus — the fearsome predator that took out a tyrannosaur in Jurassic Park 3 — actually hunted underwater. Scientists have determined that its high bone density would have allowed the behemoth to remain submerged. Previous fossil discoveries have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinosaurus-dinosaur-fossil-tail-aquatic-swimmer">revealed</a> that the spinosaurus’ tail was paddle-like — wider and thicker than had originally been thought and perfect for swimming. It is incredible how much we still have to learn!</p>
