<p>In the early morning hours of January 18, 2021 fire crews in Austria were dispatched to Top Mountain Crosspoint, a famous local motorcycle museum. When they arrived, the blaze was already shooting through the roof of the massive facility. Thankfully, workers were on the scene when the inferno began, allowing them to save the contents of a traveling Indian exhibit. However, the over 230 bikes stored inside, many of them incredibly rare, were lost to the fire.</p>

<p>The world was glued to the story of the Felicity Ace, a cargo ship carrying nearly 4,000 cars, which caught fire in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on February 16, 2022. While the origin of the blaze might never be revealed, we do know the many electrified cars’ lithium-ion batteries kept the fire burning for weeks. Those especially intense flames wouldn’t allow for traditional firefighting methods. Ultimately, the cargo ship and all the cars onboard sunk to the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>Not all cars are destroyed by accidents or natural disasters; sometimes cars are destroyed on purpose for entertainment. While people are shocked by the number Dodge Chargers destroyed by the production of <em>The Dukes of Hazzard</em> television show, which is estimated to be over 300 cars, that doesn’t hold a candle to the number of rides destroyed by the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise. During the first 7 installments alone nearly 1,500 cars were wrecked. With two more movies after that and another one in the works, that number could easily top 2,000 by the time the series wraps.</p>
