For a 3,200lb car, this engine gives the car a power to weight ratio of 0.1045. This incredible feat allows the car to jump to 60 in just 4.8 seconds which is impressive even by today’s standard. The only modification Jay Leno has done to his 'Vette was replacing the battery."

          "Leno goes on to compare the Corvette to the Miata, being that they are both sports cars that the average person could afford. This bulletproof V8 is heralded as one of America’s most reliable performance engines, this is what has allowed Leno to own the car for more than 20 years and will hopefully continue the practice. What is truly incredible about the C5 Corvette is the fact that you can still find them for just under $20,000, this makes it one of the best performance cars for the money both in its own time, with original MSRP just shy of $39,000, and our own. This is an incredibly cool car and we're glad to have been able to share one of Jay Leno’s best cars with you."
