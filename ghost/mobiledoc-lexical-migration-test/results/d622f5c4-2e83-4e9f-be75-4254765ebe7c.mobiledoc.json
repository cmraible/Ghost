It’s even better when you get to see such machines in action on the drag strip instead of just sitting in a parking lot. However, the last thing you’d probably expect it to be racing against is this 1973 Buick Riviera."

However, this one is packing some serious heat with a Stage 1 455ci V8 rated at 260-horsepower. Sure, that doesn’t seem so impressive versus the Charger R/T with its 440 V8 pushing 370-hp. But keep in mind horsepower for the Buick is rated at net not gross, so it’s not an apples and oranges comparison."
