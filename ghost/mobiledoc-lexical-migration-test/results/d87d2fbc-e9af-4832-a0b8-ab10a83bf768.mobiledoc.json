For that reason, being the original owner of this 2018 Ford GT will afford the buyer adding bragging rights among collectors."

Looking at recent auction results that have surpassed their initial estimates and skyrocketing values of these amazing machines, we wouldn't be surprised to see this car sell for well over the $1 million mark."
