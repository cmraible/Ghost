<p>One of the highlights of the collection, the <a href="https://worldwideauctioneers.com/listings/scottsdale21/1947-mercury-series-79m-marmon-herrington-4x4-station-wagon/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1947 Mercury Series 79M Marmon-Herrington 4x4 Station Wagon</a> is a true delight to see. That’s due in part to the fact there are only 6 of these known to exist in the world and this is likely the only surviving example. This wagon came with four-wheel drive at a time when such technology was rare, with Marmon and Harrington being true pioneers. A beautiful restoration has left the wood looking gorgeous outside and in, while the interior features supple leather and a plethora of original details.</p>

<p>Another of the woodies included in the collection is a <a href="https://worldwideauctioneers.com/listings/scottsdale21/1934-ford-model-40-station-wagon/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1934 Ford Model 40 Station Wagon</a>, an early example of a Ford V8. The 220ci engine produces 85-horsepower, motivating this woodie forward with aplomb. The panels on this car are made of maple, birch, and basswood, making for quite the dramatic presentation. A frame-off restoration has left no detail unaddressed, so this classic is ready to show off to the most scrutinizing of critics.</p>

<p>While all the woodies in this collection are amazing, one of the most interesting is the <a href="https://worldwideauctioneers.com/listings/scottsdale21/1917-ford-model-t-depot-hack/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1917 Ford Model T Depot Hack</a>. It wasn’t uncommon back in the day for people to modify their Model T in all sorts of ways, including the Model T Depot Hacks, which many consider some of the first taxi cabs. That makes the historical importance of this classic high. A frame-off restoration focused on correct materials and finishes, resulting in a thought-provoking view of the past.</p>
<p>Owning any of the cars from the Steelewood Collection would be an amazing privilege. For more information, Contact Charlie Kuhn at charlie@worldwideauctioneers.com</p>
