Although the SUV isn't shown in any of these pictures, a more likely explanation is that the trailer may have been too small and/or the tongue weight was too loaded. The Phantom III is a heavy car and the massive 7.3-liter V12 added even more to the tongue weight, which when not properly distributed can cause excessive swaying even at lower speeds."

When hauling yourself, always make sure to check the maintenance of the trailer and tow vehicle and never tow more than the vehicle is rated for, and when trusting your vehicle in the hands of a transport company, be sure to do your research first checking online ratings and ensuring the company has experienced drivers with proper equipment and up-to-date insurance."
