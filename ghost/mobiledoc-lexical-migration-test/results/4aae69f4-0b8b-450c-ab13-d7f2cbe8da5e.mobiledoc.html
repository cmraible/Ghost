<p>This weekend, <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-have-a-scotus-opportunity-tomorrow/">reported</a> on Mitch McConnell’s plan to adjourn the Senate for the next two weeks in order to prevent Democrats from trying to take over the Senate and throw a wrench into the GOP’s effort to confirm Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Amy Barrett. That GOP plan was put in motion on Monday, when Senate Democrats <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/519708-senate-leaves-town-for-two-weeks-amid-coronavirus-outbreak">agreed</a> to let the Republican adjournment motion pass.</p>
<p>On its face, this looks like another retreat in a long line of such retreats — which shouldn’t be surprising. Among Democratic strategists in Washington, there are always reasons to preemptively surrender and live to never fight another day.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVEuY8xrTU&feature=youtu.be">new digital ad</a> out from the Center for Popular Democracy that is ratcheting up pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to be more aggressive in trying to stop the Barrett nomination.</p>
