With custom finished coachwork and an exclusive engine, the V-16 was both expensive and a first in the U.S. Unfortunately, the Great Depression followed by WWII caused the car to be limited to just 11-years of production.

Additionally, not many were finished out by Murphy and the ones that were, were likely custom built for a specific client.
