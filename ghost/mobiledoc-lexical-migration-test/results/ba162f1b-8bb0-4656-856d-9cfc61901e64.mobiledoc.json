But the thing is gearheads aren’t normal people, so we make our own connections between classic muscle cars and the holidays which involve big burnouts. It’s definitely not going to be a silent night with that blower."

Recently, the man finished installing a Blower Shop 8-71 Supercharger and dual Quickfuel carbs, so he wanted to test out the setup. At the same time, his mom needed him to pick up a Christmas tree. Combining the two activities seems like a natural thing to us and it seemed that way to him as well, because great minds think alike. We’re even willing to bet you agree with the practicality of killing two birds with one stone."
