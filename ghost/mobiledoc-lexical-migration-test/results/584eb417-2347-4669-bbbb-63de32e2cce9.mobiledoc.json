That’s right, things are so bad, the thieves are just going after the cars when they’re occupied, not when they’re sitting overnight. According to police, all the victims were near their car while it sat in the driveway."

That’s scary because the likelihood someone is going to be seriously hurt or worse killed increases dramatically in these types of situations. The stolen cars are a 2008 white Lexus IS250, a 2019 black Toyota Rav4, and a 2019 blue Toyota Corolla."

Since they stick out like a sore thumb and aren’t horribly common, the thieves were pretty stupid to be driving around the area in it. Then again, most criminals aren’t exactly geniuses, which is why they live a life of crime."
