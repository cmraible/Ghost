The Y81 designation was used on on cars without t-tops, while the Y82 cars still used the Hurst t-tops. This Y82 features the L78 engine making it one of 6,030 built in this configuration, and all L78 SE cars came with the three-speed automatic transmission. What really makes this Trans Am Y82 special, though, is that it is a numbers-matching car with just 38,000 original miles and factory air conditioning."
