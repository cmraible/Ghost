<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Before we all head to Thanksgiving, let us give thanks for some good news that we covered this week on <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs podcasts. On <em>Lever Time</em>, we speak with the former Attorney General of Arizona who just helped pass one of the country‚Äôs first-ever dark money disclosure laws. Then, with the help of Eve 6 frontman Max Collins, we break down last week‚Äôs Ticketmaster incident involving an army of Taylor Swift fans, who it turns out may be our best hope for antitrust enforcement. On top of that, I sit down with former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Gary Hart for a detailed discussion about the past ‚Äî and future ‚Äî of American politics. <em>The Audit </em>continues its hiatus, but will be returning in December with an exciting new guest host and two terrible new teachers. Catch up on the first season below!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>

<p>In the new episode of <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota is joined by Jordan Uhl, who has been covering last week‚Äôs <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ticketmaster-faces-the-music/">Ticketmaster debacle</a> in which thousands of Taylor Swift fans learned the hard way what happens when antitrust law isn‚Äôt enforced. The two were also joined by Max Collins, frontman for the rock band Eve 6, who has firsthand experience with the abusive practices of the giant corporations that now control the music industry.</p>
