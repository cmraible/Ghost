If you’re laughing right now then you’ve probably seen plenty of quick pickups which have smoked muscle cars, Corvettes, and more. With the right setup, like what we see on this turbocharged ’92 Silverado 1500, these things can be absolutely lethal."

The back end just sits down and the tires hook up without drama, making for a nice hard launch. Then the Silverado shoots down the drag strip like an arrow. To fine tune a build like this undoubtedly took a lot of skill, time, and patience so we appreciate the end result."

Part of pushing the envelope in any vehicle is you’ll find the limits and when that happens, well carnage is part of the equation. The owner seems to have a good head on his shoulders and has a plan moving forward to get his truck to where it’s doing 5s in the quarter mile. It’ll be interesting to watch his journey unfold."
