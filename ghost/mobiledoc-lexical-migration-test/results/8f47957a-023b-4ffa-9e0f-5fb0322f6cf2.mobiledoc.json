But that wasn’t the case. Instead, the car was sold to Marshall “Perry” Boswell Jr. who put a Zagato-style front end on it essentially disguising the fact that it was ever a 1960 Corvette. After the car was listed as a Pontiac Zagato prototype in a classified, the VIN was checked against historical records proving that it is in fact Cunningham's number-one car and will hopefully receive a full, proper restoration just like the other two Corvettes that it raced alongside. Chassis number 3535 is currently on the schedule for RM Sotheby’s upcoming Amelia Island Auction. For more information on this car or other cars to be sold in this auction, "
