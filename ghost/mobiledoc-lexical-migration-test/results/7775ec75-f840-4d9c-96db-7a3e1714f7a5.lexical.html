<p>This <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1996-chevrolet-corvette-grand-sport-84">1996 Chevy Corvette Grand Sport</a> is especially desirable due to its limited production. Only 1000 Chevy Corvette Grand Sports were made in 1996, and of those, only a total of 810 were coupes, making this a very low production number car. This particular car has less than 400 miles from new, and is a two-owner car - meaning, it's basically brand new.</p>

<p>The LT4 5.7-liter V8 <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1996-chevrolet-corvette-grand-sport-84">under the hood</a> isn't even out of the 500 mile break in recommendation period, and the 350 cubic inch V8 makes 330HP, and 340 lb-ft of torque. That's an increase of 30 horsepower over and 10 lb/ft over the standard LT1. It's equipped with a ZF six speed manual transmission and a 3.45 rear axle ratio. Car and Driver tested a then-new Grand Sport and managed a zero to 60 time of five seconds flat, with the quarter mile coming in 13.5 seconds at 104 miles per hour.</p>
