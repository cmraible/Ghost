          "According to authorities, a 2018 Chevy Camaro was driven by an 18-year-old high school student in Corpus Christi, Texas when it crashed, killing two people inside back on May 31. They believe the teenager was using the muscle car to street race against another vehicle, hitting upwards of 98 mph on public roads before the accident. It’s a somber reminder of how poor decisions can come with lasting consequences."

          "After interviewing students and studying surveillance videos from nearby businesses, Corpus Christi police arrested Hector Martinez, the driver of the Camaro, on June 22. He’s facing a charge of racing on a highway. Because his actions caused serious injury or death, that charge was elevated to a second-degree felony. Martinez was able to post a $30,000 bail and was out of jail by June 27."

Police say 18-year-old Juan Cortez was behind the wheel of that car, but he turned himself in on the night of June 23. He also faces a charge of racing on a highway with the same second-degree felony enhancement."

One said the two drivers lined up on some train tracks before they raced, which is seriously one of the worst plans we’ve ever heard. This took place after the students went to a graduation rehearsal earlier in the day."
