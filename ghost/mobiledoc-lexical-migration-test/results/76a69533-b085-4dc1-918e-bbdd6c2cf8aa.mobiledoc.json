With a global recession likely, analysts and economists seem mostly to agree more premium car brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz might see a diminishing appeal to shoppers. The same thing goes for many up-line models European automakers have come to depend upon with their fat profit margins and status appeal."

Some analysts and economists believe the downturn for European automakers will be rather mild, thanks to projections that certain risk factors which looked rather doomsday-like even just a few months ago now don’t seem to be as much of a threat. Among those factors cited is the Ukraine War, which is surprising since it seems the conflict is far from resolved."

After all, the world is becoming increasingly more complex and volatile, what with governments increasing interest rates after flooding the market with monetary supply, plus there’s the risk of future supply chain shortages, the threat of war in several key regions like the South China Sea, and the stark reality that recessions don’t always behave the way we would like."
