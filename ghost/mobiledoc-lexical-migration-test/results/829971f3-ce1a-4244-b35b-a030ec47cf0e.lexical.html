Enzo Ferrari has said as much, and one is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York.</p>

<p>Suffice to say that <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1968-jaguar-xke-roadster-20/?utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the XKE</a> needs no introduction. The earliest cars are widely considered to be the prettiest, although some prefer the open headlights of the Series 2 cars. Thankfully, there's a compromise available for these folks.</p>
<p>Jaguar produced a limited number of "Series 1.5" cars, which retain most of the early design elements coupled with the later headlights. This mid-year changeover model is rare, with just over 2,800 Series 1.5 roadsters produced.</p>

<p>The car seen here was sold new in New York, but now resides in Portland, Oregon. It's never been fully restored at any one point; instead, it's been fastidiously <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1968-jaguar-xke-roadster-20/?utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">maintained</a> over the years.</p>
<p>It presents beautifully in the photos, and from the service history, we can ascertain that it'd make a fine driver, too. The odometer shows just under 72,000 miles. That's assumed to be original. 3,000 of those were added by the current owner, who purchased this car in 2016.</p>
