<p>General Motors struck gold with <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/593/1969-chevrolet-chevelle?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ral421mot">the Chevelle nameplate</a>. The model was available in four different body styles, powered by a slew of engine options, spread over the span of three different generations during one of the most iconic eras in automotive history. As such, it is not all that surprising that the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/593/1969-chevrolet-chevelle?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ral421mot">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle</a> was considered to be America’s most popular mid-size car. This spike in popularity led to production numbers of over 500,000 vehicles in 1969 alone, a majority of which were powered by a V8 engine. However, one of the most coveted options was the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/593/1969-chevrolet-chevelle?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ral421mot">396-cid powered SS Coupe</a> of which over 60,000 were produced. Despite relatively large production numbers, it can be hard to find a well preserved example that hasn’t been tinkered with.</p>

<p>Raleigh Classic Car Auctions is offering enthusiasts the opportunity to get behind the wheel of this well preserved <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/593/1969-chevrolet-chevelle?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ral421mot">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396</a>. The current owner states that this car is a two-owner Tennessee car with less than 65,000 actual miles on the clock. With factory air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes, the car is highly optioned just how it came from the factory. It features a well cared for dark green paint with a factory vinyl roof and a white stripe. All of the chrome looks nice and bright and the SS Rally Wheels finish off the look nicely.</p>

<p>Inside, the bench seats are covered in a black upholstery that matches the dash and door panels. Off setting the rich dark base color, the interior is accented with the perfect amount of shiny bright work. Contrasting it all and standing out as an exclusively unique part, a simulated wood steering wheel frames the factory 3-piece gauge cluster. Under the hood appears to be untouched. What seems to be the original 396-cid engine wears an acceptable patina while at the same time looking well maintained. The engine is mounted to a column shifted automatic transmission. This is an awesome opportunity to get your hands on a low mileage <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/593/1969-chevrolet-chevelle?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ral421mot">Chevelle</a> that has been well maintained and garage kept.</p>
