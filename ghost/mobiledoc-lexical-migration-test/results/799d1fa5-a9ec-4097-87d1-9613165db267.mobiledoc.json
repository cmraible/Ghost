We love the toned-down look of the car, which is fitting with what the Road Runner stood for back in the day. Also, we approve of the 20 SCRWS vanity plate, because it’s far better than pretty much any other one we’ve ever seen."

What’s more, the block was designed for top fuel racing in the 60s, but it’s running street heads so it’s not pushing anything crazy like 3,000-hp. Jamie says it makes 763-hp on the dyno, which isn’t too shabby."
