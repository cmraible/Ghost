<p>Good things are happening! Nebraska, the only state in the country where the public owns the power grid, has committed to net-zero electricity by mid-century. Meanwhile, baristas in Buffalo overcame a massive union-busting campaign to become the first Starbucks in the United States to unionize. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has helped to block a global waiver on COVID-19 patents, has finally left office.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s edition of You Love To See It, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><strong>• <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/12/angela-merkel-europe-europe-financial-crisis-global-market-division"><strong>Good Riddance, Angela Merkel</strong></a></strong>(Jacobin) —<em> “It is perhaps these actions taken during the Greek crisis that constitute the most disreputable chapter of Merkel’s time in office. Just as damaging as her actions, however, was her inaction. The Merkel era was also an era of neglect, with respect to investment most of all. Public net investment — in fixed capital, education, infrastructure, etc. — has stagnated in Germany over the last two decades, more than in any other developed country.” Moreover, as </em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/four-months-later-still-no-vaccine-waiver/">has pointed out</a><em>, Merkel has played a key role in blocking a patent waiver for COVID-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-wing.html?searchResultPosition=1"><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art Removes Sackler Name</strong></a></strong>(New York Times) — <em>The name of the Sackler family, the billionaire owners of Purdue Pharma, the company that aggressively marketed opioids to doctors and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/punishing-the-pain-profiteers/"><em>fueled the beginning of the opioid crisis</em></a>, is being wiped from seven exhibition spaces at the Met.</em></p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://twitter.com/Zachary_Cohen/status/1468992252638900224?s=20"><strong>Senate Committee Votes To Make Court Records Free</strong></a><em></em></strong>— <em>The Senate Judiciary Committee voted this week to make Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER), the federal database for court records, free. The movement to make PACER free was launched over a decade ago <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSegalRI/status/1469292937838317576?s=20"><em>by internet freedom activist and Reddit founder co-Aaron Swartz</em></a>, who was pursued by the FBI and ultimately <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/12/3868906/aaron-swartz-dies/in/3637531"><em>died by suicide</em></a> while facing the threats of federal prosecution for trying to make court and academic databases free and publicly accessible.</em></p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://grist.org/energy/in-a-red-state-first-nebraska-plans-to-decarbonize-power-sector-by-mid-century/"><strong>Nebraska Becomes The First Red State To Commit To Decarbonizing</strong></a></strong> (Grist) — <em>“On Thursday, the board of directors of the Nebraska Public Power District, the largest electric utility in the state, voted in favor of adopting a nonbinding decarbonization goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, which means that Nebraska is now the only Republican-controlled state in the U.S. to plan to fully decarbonize its electricity sector by mid-century. Plenty of private utilities have pledged to go green in recent years, even in Republican-controlled states. But Nebraska is unique because it’s the only state in the country where electric utilities are publicly owned. That means that Nebraskans actually vote for the people who sit on the boards of its three power utilities.” While scientists say decarbonization by 2030, not 2050, is necessary to tackle the climate crisis, the announcement is a major step forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdy43/buffalo-starbucks-union-election-victory"><strong>Starbucks Baristas Declare Victory in Historic Union Election</strong></a></strong> (VICE) — <em>“The victory for the union sends a message not only to Starbucks workers around the country, but also to workers in low-wage, high turnover industries such as restaurants, fast food, and retail that have long evaded unionization in the United States. ‘It feels surreal and incredibly exciting,’ Casey Moore, a barista at one of the unionizing Starbucks, told </em>Motherboard<em>. ‘I’m so excited to see other baristas at Starbucks and across the service industry say “if they can do it, we can do it here too.” We can change the service industry.’”</em></p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/12/seattle-kshama-sawant-reelection-socialism-city-council-capitalist-strategy"><strong>Seattle’s Capitalists Couldn’t Defeat Kshama Sawant</strong></a></strong> (Jacobin) — <em>“In a razor-tight race, Seattle’s socialist city council member Kshama Sawant beat off a recall attempt bankrolled by the city’s business interests. She won by just over two hundred votes in a race that went down to the wire. The outcome wasn’t determined until two days after the election, as mail-in ballots streamed in after election day. Six hundred ballots have been challenged and could still be counted, but they are not expected to change the recall’s outcome. Sawant won largely based on a concerted effort to get out the youth vote. Among all demographics, the eighteen to twenty-five cohort was the only one which increased its turnout from the most recent election, held only one month earlier.”</em></p>
