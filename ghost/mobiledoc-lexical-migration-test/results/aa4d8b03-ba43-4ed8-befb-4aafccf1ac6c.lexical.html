<p><a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/1635/1983-buick-riviera-convertible">Marketed by Buick</a> as a personal luxury car, the Buick Riviera was produced from 1963 until 1999 (with the exception of 1994). A first in the personal luxury car market for General Motors, the car was applauded and highly praised by automotive journalists when it debuted. This new luxury car was designed from the ground up and was the first to sit upon GM's E-platform. Even more, it was Buick's first unique Riviera model. By the time the 1980s rolled around, it was one of the most unique personal luxury cars in the price range. Being sold by Raleigh Classic Car Auctions is this well-preserved example in convertible form.</p>
