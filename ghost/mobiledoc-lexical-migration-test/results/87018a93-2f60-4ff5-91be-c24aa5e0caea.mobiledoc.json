          " and car builder with over 849,000 subscribers on YouTube, in a recent video created to address the EPA he outlined why exactly the EPA needs to back down and what we can do to help further the cause of saving our beloved modded cars. First of all, he starts by explaining what the EPA wants, the EPA is pushing legislation that would make it illegal to convert a streetcar into a dedicated race car. Although you may not want to do that, it doesn't mean that it won't affect you. Many of the parts that we put on our cars can be labeled “for off-road use only” meaning only for a track. Usually, enthusiasts will put these on their cars to give them a slight performance advantage as well as extend the customization of their vehicles. However, if these parts are banned it would lead to millions of jobs being lost, this seems very obvious to most people but the EPA doesn't take logic into account when "

These companies understand car enthusiasts won't stop loving cars just because they can't modify them. So, they’ll be forced to buy the newest performance car every year if they want to go fast. Nobody is saying that these companies for sure have something to do with this, however, those big businesses have a lot to gain here while us enthusiasts will only suffer. This is why we need to be more open about our passion, speak up against this ridiculous law. Car enthusiasts only make up a small percentage of the population which is exactly why we need to make our voices heard so that more people listen."
