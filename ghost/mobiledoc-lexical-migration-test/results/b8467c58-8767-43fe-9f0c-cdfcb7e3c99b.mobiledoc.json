One of the most notable European sports cars in his collection was this 1970 Maserati Ghibli. This car was reportedly purchased new by Sinatra’s son-in-law before being sold to him in 1973. Later the classic Maserati was sold to actor George Hamilton, and then to Wendy’s founder Dave Thomas. It has since undergone a full restoration. "
