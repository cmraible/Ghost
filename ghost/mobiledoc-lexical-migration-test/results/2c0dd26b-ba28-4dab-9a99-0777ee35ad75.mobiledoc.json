According to a local report, the young lady was trying to pilot her pony car through a curve on Eight Mile Creek Road when she lost control, left the road, and gave a homeowner quite the shock."

Fire crews constructed a T on the spot to keep the home from collapsing, then boarded up and tarped the gaping holes left by the Mustang’s vicious attack. Yes, it is that season again where Mustangs roam the streets looking for innocent houses, power poles, and crowds."

It doesn’t seem apparent just how the 18-year-old driver lost control of the car, but people are speculating it’s everything from poor road design to driver distraction. Sadly, that last one hits close to home as probably all of us have been involved in close calls because another driver found something on their smartphone more interesting than paying attention to their surroundings."
