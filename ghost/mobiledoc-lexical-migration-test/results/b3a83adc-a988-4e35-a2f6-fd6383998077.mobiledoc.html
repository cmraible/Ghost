<p>We'll readily admit that we're more "car people" than "motorcycle people" here on Motorious. When <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a motorcycle catches our attention</a> and we choose to write about it, you can rest assured that it's worth your attention, too. At least, that's what we think.</p>

<p>We doubt that we'll field any complaints about this classic <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1972 Triumph Trackmaster</a> road race replica. Currently, you can find it offered up on Bring A Trailer, where it's attracted its share of attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This heavily modified bike</a> is far cheaper than a genuine, race-used example, but it absolutely nails the aesthetic. This is definitely a "bitsa" bike, with parts coming from a selection of Triumph motorcycles and combined with a pallet-load of high-end aftermarket components.</p>

<p>The end result <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">looks terrific</a>, though. It certainly doesn't looked like a cobbled-together amalgamation of disparate parts and influences. On the contrary, it's obvious that the builder of this bike had a clear vision that they saw through to completion.</p>
<p>This bike is beautiful. it's a work of art. We'd love to park it in our living room, but this machine really belongs on a race track. We're sure that <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this bike</a> would be welcome at almost any vintage racing event.</p>

<p>Visually, the combination of polished components – including the tank and triple clamps – with the bright red painted fairing and details is attractive and arresting.</p>
<p>Power comes from a 750cc twin, fed by Mikuni carburetors, while shifting duties are handled by a five-speed transmission. As you might expect, this machine is <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">kick start only</a>. Better not skip leg day.</p>
