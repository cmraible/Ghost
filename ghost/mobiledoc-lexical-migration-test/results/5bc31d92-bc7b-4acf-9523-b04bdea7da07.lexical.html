<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Labor Department ordered Iowan pork processor Seaboard Triumph Foods to shell out $331,000 in back pay to workers from whom they had stolen wages. Seaboard’s illegal wage theft is part of a larger trend of labor violations among corporations — many of which receive generous government subsidies — that has finally started to attract regulators’ attention.</p>
<p>As Pat Garofalo writes for <em>Boondoggle </em>in a story we highlight below, “By pairing vigorous labor law enforcement with antitrust reform and an end to corporate subsidies, states and localities can begin to break the hold corporations have over local labor markets and ensure that workers are paid a fair wage for a fair day’s work.”</p>

    <li><a href="https://boondoggle.substack.com/p/subsidized-by-taxpayers-stealing?s=r"><strong>Subsidized By Taxpayers, Stealing From Workers</strong></a> (Boondoggle) — <em>“Wage theft is a serious issue, with the Economic Policy Institute finding that between 2017 and 2020, state and federal agencies and private actors recovered more than $3.2 billion that had been stolen from workers — which means the actual total is far higher, since enforcement actions lag the actual theft and a lot of wage theft surely never gets prosecuted. But in the case of Seaboard Triumph Foods, the issue is compounded by the fact that taxpayers were subsidizing the company, meaning the public put money into one of Seaboard’s hands as it was stealing from workers with the other.”<br></em></li>

They had a list of names, including ours, and they were closing in. We were the only international journalists left in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, and we had been documenting its siege by Russian troops for more than two weeks. We were reporting inside the hospital when gunmen began stalking the corridors. Surgeons gave us white scrubs to wear as camouflage. Suddenly at dawn, a dozen soldiers burst in: ‘Where are the journalists, for fuck’s sake?’ I looked at their armbands, blue for Ukraine, and tried to calculate the odds that they were Russians in disguise. I stepped forward to identify myself. ‘We’re here to get you out,’ they said.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/17/the-stealth-operative-for-big-oil-whos-out-to-derail-americas-climate-fight"><strong>The Man Who Could Help Big Oil Derail America’s Climate Fight</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“Goldberg is part of a network of enablers working to preserve big oil’s power and reputation as it faces a barrage of litigation. More than two dozen cities, states and municipalities allege the industry lied to Americans for decades by downplaying and outright denying that fossil fuels caused climate change. The lawsuits demand companies use some of their vast profits to help pay for the human toll of the climate crisis, including the damage brought by rising seas and increasingly severe weather disasters. Desperate to avoid costly settlements, the fossil fuel industry relies on front organisations to discredit the litigation and sway public opinion in its favour. So nearly three years ago, the friends of big oil turned to Goldberg, a former Democratic congressional aide and self-described ‘committed environmentalist,’ to persuade Americans that the companies responsible for the growing climate disaster are now the ones to fix the problem.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/in-a-world-on-fire-stop-burning-things"><strong>In A World On Fire, Stop Burning Things</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“Along with discussing carbon fees and green-energy tax credits, amid the momentary focus on disabling Russian banks and flattening the ruble, there’s a basic, underlying reality: the era of large-scale combustion has to come to a rapid close. If we understand that as the goal, we might be able to keep score, and be able to finally get somewhere. Last Tuesday, President Biden banned the importation of Russian oil. This year, we may need to compensate for that with American hydrocarbons, but, as a senior Administration official put it,’the only way to eliminate Putin’s and every other producing country’s ability to use oil as an economic weapon is to reduce our dependency on oil.’ As we are one of the largest oil-and-gas producers in the world, that is a remarkable statement. It’s a call for an end of fire.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://eoinhiggins.substack.com/p/the-effects-of-federal-covid-funding"><strong>The Effects Of Federal Covid Funding Cuts Are Already Being Felt In Schools</strong></a> (The Flashpoint) — <em>“An upstate New York school in the Hudson Valley is changing COVID testing protocols because of federal funding cuts. Staff at the school, which is remaining unnamed to protect source anonymity, received an email from the district’s superintendent on Tuesday alerting them that ‘changes with the COVID testing from our government’ having to do with federal funding meant that there would be no testing of staff this week. ‘This impacts unvaccinated teachers who are required to test, plus those of us who opt to test weekly,’ Jane, a teacher at the school, told me. ‘I don't know what it's going to look like next week.’”<br></em></li>
