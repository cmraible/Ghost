Powering this beast is a Lingenfelter 417-cubic-inch LS3 V8 engine equipped with CNC ported and polished heads with an 11.5:1 compression. Shifting power to the rear wheels is provided by a T-56 six-speed manual transmission. Accompanying that V8 in rumble and performance is a Magnaflow stainless steel exhaust. This C5 'Vette puts out a healthy 605-horsepower. Big Wilwood power disc brakes all around bring all that power to a halt, and power steering makes maneuvering that road course a breeze. Speaking of this being one of RideTech's test cars for suspension parts, this one is equipped with TQ triple-adjust able coil overs, Delrin control arm bushings throughout, and front and rear sway bars."
