<p>The author of the other talk I was really sad to miss at Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin, Lee Bryant of <a href="http://www.headshift.com/">Headshift</a>, has now published his slides <a href="http://www.headshift.com/blog/2008/10/niche-online-social-networks-f.php">over on the firm’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>

</div>Although the presentation gives some good examples of niche social networks in use, I like Lee’s analysis of the value of Facebook against niches, which makes a nice riposte to [last week’s BBC story](http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/enterprise-social-software/2008/10/ease-up-on-facebook-blocks.html):<blockquote>
    <p>I remain convinced that intimacy and common purpose are more in line<br>with the culture of the internet than mega-malls like Facebook, where<br>funders are more interested in achieving a ridiculous $15bn valuation<br>for the company than in changing peoples’ lives for the better.</p>
