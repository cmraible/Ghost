Once every millennia, the Great Leviathan emerges from the ocean’s depths to curse the world into monochromatic chaos! By exploring land and sea, collecting treasures and creatures along the way, you will need to combat the Leviathan’s cronies and rebuild the city of Star Harbor in order to restore the color to the world! As fans of classic American cartoons of the 1930s, Steamboat Billy&#8217;s art style is very much an homage to that era, albeit with a few differences. We&#8217;ve added some anime flair to our characters and we aren&#8217;t afraid of mixing in modern animation techniques and visual effects.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Steamboat Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan - Kickstarter Trailer (PC, PS4, Switch, Xbox One)\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1_ERNIro0Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1106152318/steamboat-billy-the-curse-of-the-leviathan\">Click here to go to the Kickstarter page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The team at Switchaboo are certainly sold on this game, but how about you?
