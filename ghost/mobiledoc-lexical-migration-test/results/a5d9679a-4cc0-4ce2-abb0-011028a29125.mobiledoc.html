<p>While Texas’ energy officials have rightly pointed to fossil fuel shortages as responsible for the state’s blackouts, Gov. Greg Abbott has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/17/texas-abbott-wind-turbines-outages/">been</a> appearing on Fox News <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/">blaming</a> wind turbines and renewable energy for the state’s woes, even though as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/climate/texas-blackouts-disinformation.html">New York Times</a> notes, Texas’s “widespread electricity failure was largely caused by freezing natural gas pipelines.”</p>
<p>Following the money offers one reason why Abbott is so determined to concoct such a ridiculous narrative and vilify the Green New Deal.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Congressional Budget Office has been putting out misleading information designed to undermine proposals to raise the minimum wage and pass a big stimulus bill.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>A new estimate of how many COVID deaths could have been prevented during Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p>• Is Biden on track to replicate the legislative success of Franklin Roosevelt’s first 100 days? One key stat offers a clue.</p>
