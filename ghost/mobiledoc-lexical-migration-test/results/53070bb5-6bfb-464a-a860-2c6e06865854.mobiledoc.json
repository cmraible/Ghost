Yes, it was a relatively cheap purchase, but all those shredded body panels alone have got to cost a pretty penny. This project is being sponsored, so it’s possible Tavraish isn’t going to be paying anything out of pocket for parts. Also, he’s going to be doing the work himself, which will help bring the cost down considerably. Even with all that help it’s going to be a long process."

At least the guy’s thankful and appreciative of his unique position, instead of whining about how put-upon he is by having such an opportunity."
