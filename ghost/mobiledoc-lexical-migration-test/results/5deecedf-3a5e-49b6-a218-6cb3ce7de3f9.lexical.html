<p>When the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0030-2003-ferrari-enzo/1015409?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">Ferrari Enzo</a> was first revealed to the world, its aggressive, angular styling took a while to grow on us. After a decade of rounded, curvaceous styling, the Enzo wasn't simply a return to the aggressive, wedge-shaped '80s. Instead, it brought that hard-edged style into the new millennium. </p>

<p>We'll admit that we didn't like it at first, but then something strange happened – we <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0030-2003-ferrari-enzo/1015409?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">started to fall for it</a>. Hard. What changed?</p>
<p>It's simple – the color. We may have been cool on the Enzo when we saw it in red, but seeing it in yellow changed our mind with a quickness. The cover story of the July 2003 issue of Car and Driver featured a yellow Enzo – <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0030-2003-ferrari-enzo/1015409?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">this very car</a>, in fact – facing off against a handful of contemporary supercars.</p>

<p>While we were busy drooling over the styling, the staff at Car and Driver were busy drooling over the car's <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0030-2003-ferrari-enzo/1015409?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">impressive performance</a>. The Enzo's screaming V12 produced 651 horsepower and 485 lb/ft of torque. Zero to 60 came in just 3.3 seconds, en route to a top speed of 218 MPH. Even today, those numbers are more than respectable.</p>
<p>The Enzo performed admirably against its contemporaries, and eventually changed hands a few times, accumulating just over 11,400 miles as of 2017. Few can say they own <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0030-2003-ferrari-enzo/1015409?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">a magazine cover car</a> – that sort of pedigree is a great conversation starter at your next Ferrari club meeting.</p>
