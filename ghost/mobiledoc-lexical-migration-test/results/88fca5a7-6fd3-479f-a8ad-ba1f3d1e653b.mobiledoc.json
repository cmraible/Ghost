          "The Bugeye Sprite gets its nickname, of course, from its hood-mounted headlights giving it a bug-eyed look, and that smile-like lower grille and cheek--like protruding fenders give this small roadster an even cuter face. The bug-eyed MkI Sprite was only around from 1958 through 1961, so these cars aren't that common today. The bright red paint job does show some minor wear and tear, but overall it's a sharp little car that would be ideal for daily driving or undergoing a full restoration. It's hard to argue with this car's style with that factory hardtop and dog-dish hubcaps adding to the fun-loving style."

With the addition of an aftermarket steering wheel and radio, the interior is all original and in great shape, and this car even comes with its original factory steering wheel. In addition to that rare factory hardtop, this Sprite is equipped with a soft top, removable side windows and a soft tonneau cover."
