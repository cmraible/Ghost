Fewer people seem to be aware that with crabs you don’t have to put the lid on the pot because they’ll pull each other back into the boiling water so nobody escapes their fate. These two analogies remind me of the irrational hate I received back in early August for pointing out there’s a movement to start getting enthusiasts away from collecting actual, real cars in favor of digital NFTs. Apparently, pointing out a possibility makes one “a (sic) idiot” as one person so ironically shared."

Take a moment to process that: someone paid that kind of money for a Photoshopped representation of Godzilla, and it’s not even that good of a picture!"

That means some charitable organization is getting $2,500,000 CAD so you could argue it was all for the children or a good cause or whatever makes you feel better. Still, this is a clear signal that the push for NFT collecting instead of acquiring real cars is becoming, well… real."

Countless tech and mainstream publications have fantasized about the end of personal car ownership. They believe roving gangs of automated robot taxis or car sharing services will provide a utopian society for us all to enjoy. Apparently, these people skipped the section in Economics 101 about why public property is poorly maintained."

After all, if you can still have some cool cars in some virtual garage, why do you need the real thing? That’s obviously a completely out-of-touch approach, but it’s one that’s being teed up anyway. Yes, these people don’t get what you like about your smelly, polluting cars."

I can get on board with the legitimacy of that viewpoint, only a lot of the digital tokens are some pretty crap art, to be perfectly honest. But as these NFTs are marketed, it’s obvious at least some people want to promote them as the way for gearheads to stop collecting actual cars. After all, it’s to save the planet, the children, or whatever else will tug at your heartstrings."
