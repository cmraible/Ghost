A Dodge Charger took on another unidentified vehicle, only to crash in a parking lot where volunteers had been feeding the homeless last Thursday afternoon. Three people were injured in the crash and the other driver got away."

Then the Dodge veered through oncoming traffic, somehow missing those cars, finally coming to rest in a convenience store parking lot after it hit a parked Chevy Monte Carlo."

The activity had finished but they were still gathered together to watch football when the crash happened. Lewis believes his car saved lives as the Charger was headed straight for the group of people."

While it might seem unusual that someone was street racing on the holiday, there’s actually a bit of history of this sort of thing happening. Chalk it up to people sitting bored at home, not wanting to fight over pumpkin pie with the family, or whatever, but street racing on Thanksgiving is a bit of an issue."
