<p>We’re fresh into the second month of the 2019 year, and <a href="https://www.mecum.com/news/2019/02/05/industry-leader-mecum-auctions-starts-2019-with-1338-million-in-sales/2631/">Mecum</a> is having a good year already. As Barrett-Jackson had their most successful auction at Scottsdale, and raised a record amount for charity, Mecum’s two January auctions earned them the same record breaking claims with $133.8 Million in sales - this comes from a combination of revenue from Kissimmee, Florida, auction and the 28th annual Vintage and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/vintage-motorcycles-auction-vegas/">Antique Motorcycle Auction</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A massive 7,517 count of collector cars, motorcycles, road art, and miscellaneous automobila went up from sale in January. Of those lots, 6,267 were sold, for a 83-percent sell-through rate at the events. 2,328 collector cars were sold alone at the massive Kissimmee auction, which is the company’s largest collector-car auction event - this equated to a revenue of $107.5 million between the cars and Road Art transactions.</p>
