This Pontiac gets the GTO treatment with all of the obvious GTO badges, trim and rally wheels as well as the features that will even throw off GTO connoisseurs like the hood and four-segment slotted taillights. Likewise, proper work was done to make this clone look like a legit GTO right down to correct bucket seats, center console and the GTO Rally Gauge cluster. Fake GTO or not, this is one super-clean Pontiac!"

Not that you could miss this car with its flashy PPG Viper Red paint job and bright chrome, but with the big engine combined with powder-coated headers and a 2.5-inch dual exhaust, you'll be able to hear this car coming from blocks away."
