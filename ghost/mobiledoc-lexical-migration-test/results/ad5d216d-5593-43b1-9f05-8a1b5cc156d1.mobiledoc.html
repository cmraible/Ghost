<p>Frankly, it's a bit of a difficult morning. </p>
<p>The tone of today in audience circles is very different to last week, when the news of Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter hit. There's rather fewer jokes, and rather more sympathy, as we start to see UK-based Twitter employees losing their jobs. Their US colleagues will be going through the same experience in a few hours, and the expectation is that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/03/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/">up to half of Twitter's staff</a> will be laid off. </p>
<p>I'm going to devote much of this post to what we in the journalism business should be watching for in these layoffs, but first I want to take a moment to acknowledge the humans at the heart of this.</p>
<h2 id="the-personal-cost">The personal cost</h2>
<p>These are just a few tweets I've seen from personal friends or online acquaintances who've been fired this morning:</p>

<p>They're all talented folks, whom I hope and expect will land on their feet, but seeing work they've invested the best part of a decade in dismantled, while being told they're personally surplus to requirements, can't be emotionally easy. My very best wishes to all of them.</p>
<p>Now, what does this mean for the rest of us?</p>
<h2 id="the-canaries-in-twitters-coal-mine">The canaries in Twitter's coal mine</h2>
<p>A million years ago and, at the same time, a week ago, when Musk took over Twitter, I realised that there were four major things to watch as Musk reshaped Twitter. ¬†If some or all of them changed, the relationship between the platform and journalism would be reshaped for ever.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Major changes to verification</li>
    <li>Changes to the publisher relationships in Twitter Blue</li>
    <li>Dismantling of the Curation/Moments team</li>
    <li>Dismantling of the News Partnerships team</li>
</ol>
<p>And how do things stand now? Two have happened, one looks likely to have happened <em>(UPDATE: Now confirmed ‚Äî see below)</em>, and we're waiting to hear about the last:</p>
<ol>
    <li>‚úÖ Major changes to verification</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Changes to the publisher relationships in Twitter Blue</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Dismantling of the Curation/Moments team</li>
    <li>‚ùìDismantling of the News Partnerships team</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>
<p>Look, I have my <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/07/messy-verification-process-leave-blue-ticks-open-to-abuse/">issues with how Twitter runs verification</a> and, in particular, how it creates a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/04/social-media-verification-still-a-crapshoot/">two tier system for journalists</a>. But there's no doubt that being a proven, verified journalist goes some way to helping you stand out amidst the misinformation noise on the platform. Musk's move to make verification for all available for a fee will fundamentally dilute that ability. That's our first canary expired.</p>
<h3 id="twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</h3>
<p>The publisher relationships that allowed subscribers to have access to ad-free articles via Twitter Blue, the subscription service available in some parts of the world, was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/01/twitter-chaos/">killed unexpectedly by Twitter</a>. Musk clearly wants to renegotiate those relationships:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us</p>‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587500624098246656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2022</a>
    </blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure>
<p>But it's hard to trust someone who kills ‚Äî on a whim, with no notice ‚Äî something you put development work into supporting, isn't it? </p>
<h3 id="moments-curation">Moments & Curation</h3>
<p>The curation team was (and yes, it looks like the past tense <em>is</em> appropriate) the internal journalistic part of Twitter, curating the best news and Tweets in a way that brought value to the platform ‚Äî and traffic to publishers. It was led by friend-of-the-blog Joanna Geary, late of the <em>Birmingham Post</em>, <em>The Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em>. </p>
<p>She was the first of the ‚Äúpersonal cost‚Äù tweets above. </p>
<p>If, as it looks like, this team is essentially gone, it will make it that much harder for news publishers to stand out from the noise on Twitter. </p>
<p><strong>Update ‚Äî 12.15pm, 4/11/22</strong></p>
<p>Yup, the Curation team is gone:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h3 id="news-partnerships">News Partnerships</h3>
<p>The major social platforms have long had news partnership teams, whose job it its to build closer relationships with major publishers. That's why journalists seem to get special treatment for things like verification ‚Äî it's handled between the social teams of major publishers and the news partnership folks. </p>
<p>If this team gets dismantled in the layoffs today ‚Äî and I've seen no evidence either way yet ‚Äî then truly Twitter, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2022/07/facebooks-long-slow-breakup-with-journalism-is-underway/">like Facebook before it</a>, is planning to leave journalism behind.</p>
<p>Today will be an interesting day. </p>
