Surprisingly, the Frontier 4x2 King Cab is still on its original engine and transmission, and even the list of maintenance and repairs are impressive for the mileage. Murphy changes the oil himself every 10,000 miles, and major required repairs include original parts including the alternator (at 400,000 miles), water pump (at 600,000 miles) and clutch (at 601,000 miles), while the timing chain was replaced at 700,000 miles as preventative maintenance. Despite driving that many miles and living in the Chicago area, the truck is surprisingly clean."
