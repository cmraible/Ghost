<p>First generation S10s have a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/coolest-celebrate-halloween/">delightfully boxy</a>, utilitarian style that is timeless. These <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/facebook-oddity-1990-ford-centurion-c350/">trucks are beloved</a> by their owners. Of course, it helps that they lend themselves to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/restomod-chevy-camaro-lsx/">V8 conversions</a>.</p>
<p>That's exactly what happened to <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/214003/1986-chevrolet-s-10-pickup">the S10 you see here</a>. Finding these trucks in clean, rust free condition is difficult. These were inexpensive work trucks, so must were used up and thrown away. The V8 under the hood is just a bonus, as far as we're concerned.</p>

<p>The third generation Plymouth Barracuda, which ran from 1970 to 1975, gets quite a lot of respect in muscle car and collector car circles. In our opinion, the first and <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">second generation cars</a> deserve more attention than they get.</p>
<p><a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This tastefully modified 1969 Barracuda</a> is a great example of the second generation. Like the first generation (1964-1966), the second generation (1967-1969) shared a lot of its underpinnings with the Valiant.</p>
