It was always rumored that the 426 hemi was one of those incredibly underrated cars engines from the factory. This was pretty much confirmed as the engine within Qualls his car was said to have been making over 500 hp. Keep in mind, that’s without modification.",

His car was black to blend in and run from the police that he probably worked with, he wasn’t the kind of guy to go bragging about his illegal accomplishments, and when his race was run he retired the car in 1975. It was obvious that Qualls was a man of great restraint as well as strength, which is perfectly represented by his vehicle. Nowadays, while he would’ve probably liked for the car to stay within the family, the current owner has decided it’s time for the car to move on and at least we can all rest assured knowing that the car won’t go to waste due to its great reputation. Hopefully the car goes to somebody who can maintain it and maybe even get it back racing on the track. But for now, time will only tell.",
