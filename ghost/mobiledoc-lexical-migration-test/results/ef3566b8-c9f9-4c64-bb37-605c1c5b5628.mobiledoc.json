It has under 5,000 miles on the odometer, which helps explain why the Mineral Gray exterior and Alcantara interior look about as clean as when this supercar was new. Making for excellent highlights are the orange brake calipers and matching accents on the seats."

Carbon fiber side intakes, super lightweight forged wheels, and a vehicle lifter are included as well. There’s also the Extended Carbon Fibre Interior Upgrade for the same look and lightweighting benefits for the cabin. You even get a parking camera, making maneuvering into spots so much less stressful."

It capitalizes on the 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 with a raucous 666 bhp and 516 lb.-ft. of torque on hand. That’s considerable since dry weight for the 675LT Spider is officially listed at 2,800 pounds. Push this McLaren to the limit and you’ll hit 203 mph. It’s also quick, doing 0-62 mph in just 2.9 seconds."
