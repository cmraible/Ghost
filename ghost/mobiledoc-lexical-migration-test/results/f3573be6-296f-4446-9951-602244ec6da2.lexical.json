Sure, the 300 SLR is already a pretty rare car but only a special few in the world can truly say that they are anywhere near one of a kind. On top of that, both cars have remained in the possession of the Mercedes-Benz company since their production and who knows if Mercedes will ever part ways with the other car. Essentially, what this means is that this really might be the only opportunity buyers have to get their hands on one of these cars for literally decades. All things considered, it’s really not that crazy to see how this car became the most expensive one ever sold. Regardless, this car now holds the world record and it’s gonna take something really ferocious to ever even try and defeat it.",
