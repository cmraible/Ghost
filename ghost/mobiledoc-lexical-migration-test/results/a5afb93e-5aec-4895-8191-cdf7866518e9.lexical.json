What’s worse is when you have something far more valuable inside the trailer and it’s taken as well. That’s the situation Ekins Garage in West Jordan, Utah was facing when someone stole a trailer with a 1950s Dodge truck inside sometime in the night on December 21. Thankfully, someone spotted the trailer on December 26. It was recovered with everything still inside, making for a true Christmas miracle.",
