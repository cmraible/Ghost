<hr>
<p>Just the promise of watching a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1966-chevrolet-chevelle-ss/">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS</a> race a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/1970-dodge-challenger-r-t-is-mopar/">1970 Dodge Challenger R/T</a>, both supposedly in stock spec is exciting. After all, people argue all the time about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/challenger-rt-races-copo-camaro/">which American muscle cars are the best</a>, especially when it comes to the classics which emerged during the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/dodge-daytona/">horsepower wars</a>. Sure, for some people this will just be a matter of rooting for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cuda-vs-camaro/">Mopar or Chevy</a> because they like one brand more than the other, but there’s so much more going on here.</p>
<blockquote><em>See another Mopar vs Chevy smackdown right <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/challenger-rt-races-copo-camaro/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>First up is the Dodge Challenger R/T, which brings it with a 440ci V8 and a Six Pack, combining for a claimed 390-horsepower. Sadly, this Mopar has a TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic instead of a manual transmission, so that’s a little disappointing. A 4.30 rear and a weight of 3,640 lbs. make for a competent setup, making this Dodge a definite threat on the drag strip.</p>

<p>As one of the all-time favorite muscle cars, the 1969 Chevelle SS might have more fans rooting for it. But this isn’t just a popularity contest. Good thing the Chevy packs a rare L89 396ci V8 with OE aluminum heads for a factory-rated 375-hp. Like the Mopar, the Chevelle is running a 3-speed automatic, this one being the TH400. However, the 4.88 rear gear is nice and aggressive, which could give it the much-needed edge in the race, despite it tipping the scale at 3,690 lbs.</p>

<p>While for some it’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-imperial-trashes/">all about brand loyalty</a>, and they’ll see this race as a matchup of a Mopar and GM but nothing else, other people can see the unique attributes of these two titans and make a more impartial assessment of which will ultimately win.</p>
