<p>A bill introduced at the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pontiac-fiero-collection/">Michigan</a> state senate could mean the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-jersey-vintage-license-plates/">classic blue license plate</a> will make a comeback. It’s proposed the vintage black license plate also return. That’s exciting news for people who want the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/australian-vintage-motorcycle-collection-hides-in-a-bunker/">vintage</a> look for their vehicle instead of the modern options. With a simpler, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/17-car-garage/">minimal design</a> it’s easy to understand why both of these license plates could become a popular option.</p>
<p>This plan isn’t just about vehicle aesthetics. Sen. Mallory McMorrow is pushing for it as a way to generate funds to repair the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-model-t-off-roading/">state’s crumbling roads</a>. If you don’t understand what that’s all about, you’ve never visited Michigan. For the privilege of having either the vintage blue or black license plate, Michigan residents would need to pay an additional $100.</p>
<p>Others see bringing the old license plates as possibly generating more benefits. “The classic plate designs will go a long way toward instilling pride in Michigan’s reputation as the cradle of automotive development,” said Shawn Pomaville-Size, Executive Director of the MotorCities National Heritage Area. Pomaville-Size has visions of the plates elevating the state’s tourism from gearheads, pumping money into the local economy. We’re not exactly sure how license plates do that, but they might.</p>
<p>Those blue license plates were used in Michigan from 1983 to 2007, so they haven’t been out of commission that long. Still, people have pined away for them recently. As for the black plates, they were used from 1979 to 1983, making them even more sought-after in certain circles.</p>
<p>There’s been growing interest across the United States on bringing back vintage license plate designs. Back in 2014 California brought back its black and gold plates, which were incredibly popular. New Jersey has been considering <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-jersey-vintage-license-plates/">resurrecting the light blue license plates</a> which went out of circulation in 1991.</p>
