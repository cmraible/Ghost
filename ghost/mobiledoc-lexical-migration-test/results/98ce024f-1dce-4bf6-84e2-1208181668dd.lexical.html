<p>The TikTok algo is still failing to “get” me after months of trying. That may say more about me than it does about the service, though…</p>
<h2 id="all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-old-folks"><br>All Your Base Are Belong To Us Old Folks</h2>
<p>One of the very oldest internet memes hit 20 years old earlier in the month. Here's a great history of that moment: </p>

<p>There's also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287208/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-20th-anniversary-internet-culture">a short <em>Verge</em> article</a> which has one good insight:</p>
<blockquote>Watching it now, 20 years later, the thing that stands out to me most is how culturally dated the video feels. It’s from the era of internet culture when the whole joke was getting the reference; back then, the internet was much harder to access and not the kind of culture-defining trend machine it eventually became. Knowing the reference — and sneaking it in places it didn’t belong — was funny because not everyone could figure out what it meant, unless, of course, you were part of the tribe.</blockquote>
<p>I miss the time when there was a distinct seperation between internet culture and general culture. The blending of the two has not been kind to either. </p>

<p>While we're on the subject of restrofuturistic nostalgia, this takedown of John Perry Barlow's famour <em>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em> is, perhaps, unduly harsh — but still accurate. </p>

<p>There's not much “for better” to be found in the article, but I truly miss the age when the internet was a place where this seemed liek a good idea. </p>

<p>SmugMug (yes, the photo-hosting site), has been doing this great series of video profile of photographers. The <a href="https://twitter.com/jay_ford_?lang=en">Jay Ford</a> minidoc was particularly interesting: </p>
