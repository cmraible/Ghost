<p>If you’ve been reading me long enough – or had the misfortune to be trained by me – you’ll probably have heard me describe myself as a “grouchy old cluetrain advocate”. And, by “cluetrain”, I mean <a href="http://cluetrain.com">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, of course.</p>
<p>(I find the Cluetrain Manifesto to be a useful bozo test – if the “digital expert” or “social media guru” you’re talking to has never heard of it, there’s a fair chance they’re a bozo.)</p>
<p>Well, Cluetrain is <em>back</em>.</p>
<h2 id="new-clues">New Clues</h2>
<p>Two of the original authors of the Manifesto, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2015/01/08/cluetrain-rides-again/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2015/01/08/new-clues/">David Weinberger</a>, have written <a href="http://cluetrain.com/newclues/">New Clues</a> – some new clues for today’s internet. And some of it is just biting:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>60 – Ads that sound human but come from your marketing department’s irritable bowels, stain the fabric of the Web.</p>
    <p>61 – When personalizing something is creepy, it’s a pretty good indication that you don’t understand what it means to be a person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s well worth taking the time to read in full. And I suspect I’ll be doing “Clues of the day” here for a little while…</p>
