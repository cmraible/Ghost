Although, the eighth generation design change has seemed to interrupt the trend of the incoming model year topping the one prior. Not that the C8 Stingray is not the most powerful base model to date because it is.

As the original muscle car era progressed though, the competition became more and more fierce and the GTO risked losing the race, not only from new cars rolling off the line but from enthusiast and backyard mechanics as well."

Over the years, Land Rover has built some of the sickest vehicles to ever hit the mud trails and has even made a name for some of the older vehicles. For instance, this rugged 1975 Land Rover forward control truck. Now you might be thinking that 1975 was a long time ago, and you’d be right. However, this truck is not all original it may even be able to keep up with some of the best off-road type vehicles of today."

With the new Chevy Blazer and Ford Bronco gaining popularity, it’s starting to feel like we rewound to another era - which has us auto enthusiasts talking a lot about the beginning of these vehicles. The smaller scaled SUVs stormed onto the market with tons of versatility and styling with them."

The model was available in four different body styles, powered by a slew of engine options, spread over the span of three different generations during one of the most iconic eras in automotive history. As such, it is not all that surprising that the 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle was considered to be America’s most popular mid-size car. This spike in popularity led to production numbers of over 500,000 vehicles in 1969 alone, a majority of which were powered by a V8 engine. However, one of the most coveted options was the 396-cid powered SS Coupe of which over 60,000 were produced. Despite relatively large production numbers, it can be hard to find a well preserved example that hasn’t been tinkered with."
