<p>Finished in Elkhart Lake Blue Metallic, the exterior is nothing short of stunning. Matching that perfectly are the staggered 5-spoke Carbon Flash-painted aluminum wheels (19-inch front, 20-inch rear) wrapped with sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber. A high-wing Carbon Flash rear spoiler and an exposed carbon fiber ground effects kit really add to the sporty flair of this ride. Then there's the black interior that features carbon fiber trim and GT2 bucket seats, making you feel comfortable as you power through hairpin turns.</p>
