When agents opened the shipping containers, they found mattresses were stacked up to hide the vehicles. Obscuring the view of stolen cars is a common practice of theft rings. That means authorities either have to gather information about shipments or use advanced X-rays to detect the hidden vehicles."

Among the 23 stolen vehicles were high-ticket items like a Mercedes-AMG G55, Range Rover HSE Sport, Lexus RX350, BMW X7, and Audi Q8-S. While thieves love stealing luxury cars because they’re so coveted and valuable, this shipment also included some Hondas and Hyundais. That means no matter what you drive, you could fall victim to theft."
