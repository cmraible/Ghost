<p>Chevrolet has given us some of the most iconic classic trucks of all time due to their reliability and true American design that has evolved throughout time. What does the future hold for the new generation of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/boosted-2020-silverado/">Chevy trucks</a>? Can they still hold <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/australian-muscle-car-values/">their value</a> and desirability in the decades to come?</p>

<p>The first <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/trucks/">Chevy truck</a> was introduced in 1918 as an affordable option for the American worker. There is no question they are meant to be put to work, but our fascination with trucks have made them classic and very desirable collector vehicles today. For a week, I had the opportunity to drive the 2021 2500 Silverado to see how it would work for the consumer today, but also, will it end of up on a list of most desirable classic trucks in 25+ years. </p>

<p><em>The LTZ Z71 Sport Edition got me thinking two different things: luxury and future classic?</em></p>
<p>With an as tested price of $71,110.00 (destination charge included), this is not your basic work truck; the technology and amenities reminded you of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/luxury-car-sales-are-booming/">luxury vehicle</a>. The cabin is spacious and quiet, even comfortable for someone over 6"2. Chevrolet's infotainment 3 plus 8-inch HD color touchscreen with voice recognition allows you to access most of the truck's functionality directly from the screen. Bluetooth audio streaming wireless connects with Apple Carplay and Android Auto. Feeling cool or hot? Front passengers have the ventilated front seat option or heated seats for front and rear passengers. Even the leather wrapped steering wheel is heated for extra cold days. A refined interior is highlighted with stitched upholstery throughout. </p>
<p>Besides it's exterior bold, good looks, functionality and practicality are everywhere. Easy bed access with the corner step rear bumper and side bed steps. Power adjustable heated trailering mirrors, and power up/down tailgate. The Z71 Sport Edition option gives the truck an exterior refinement with black badging, door handles, grill, and body color bumpers. The 18-inch high-gloss black aluminum wheels wrapped in Mud Terrain tires give it a great factory custom look. </p>

<p>Although the truck is loaded, the Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel is a reminder that this is a work horse. The 445hp engine produces 910 lb.-ft. of torque. It is mated to a 10-speed Allison automatic transmission, all capable of trailering up to 18,500 pounds. My tested truck did have the optional Gooseneck/5th wheel package. </p>

<p>There is a sense of empowerment while driving this truck, as you feel you're towering over traffic, it makes you feel tough and proud. Pickup truck owners love their truck and it makes sense that on average their ownership lifecycle will be longer than a standard car owner. The love for trucks becomes generational and this love affair is partially to blame for the collectability factor they provide. <em><strong>There is no doubt in my mind this will be a sought after truck for years to come. </strong></em></p>
