          "Holding electric motorcycles back are a few factors. One is weight. Lithium-ion batteries aren’t exactly light as a feather, especially if you want good range, even on a motorcycle. While in a car, truck, or SUV the driver will barely notice several hundred pounds or far more added to the curb weight, a rider has to deal with the extra porky nature of the batteries, so there is definitely a limit. Sure, the elusive solid state battery technology everyone has been talking about for years could help solve this problem, but nobody knows for sure when that might happen."

          "Then there’s the fact electric motorcycles don’t do so great on open roadways. A single-speed transmission similar to what you find in other EVs is great for driving on city streets, but getting on a highway or other long, high-speed stretches of road shows the limits of the setup. With electric cars, that can be remedied by adding a second motor and making the bodywork highly aerodynamic. Those types of workarounds are a little more difficult to implement on a motorcycle."

          "Some have argued the motorcycle industry in North America is doing everything wrong. Instead of making small, light, stripped-down urban commuters for younger buyers who want cheap transportation, they’ve been focusing on expensive status symbols with gobs of power and features. That might be in part because motorcycle ownership on this continent has become a luxury not a necessity. However, proponents of electric motorcycles believe if the types of models one doesn’t even need a motorcycle endorsement to ride, like what’s become popular in Europe and Asia, were introduced to this market, younger shoppers would flock to them in droves."

There are all kinds of online guides for taking on a project like this, with many claiming their builds cost less than $2,000. Sure, this isn’t for everyone, especially someone who thinks bought not built is the way to go, but for adventurous and handy riders this might be an ideal urban commuter option."

          "The least understood and most developing motorcycle propulsion technology is hydrogen. Just like in the car market, motorcycle companies have been toying with the idea of fueling an electric motor using a fuel cell instead of a battery. Among the advantages of this approach is quick refueling times and range similar to traditional motorcycles. However, producing hydrogen fuel can be expensive, transporting it is difficult, and so there are few fueling stations in the world. That might change as more automakers push for this technology to be adopted."
