The Stingray design was the prefect evolution from the C1, adding a more muscular, aggressive feel to match the respectable performance. This is why so many admire the second-gen Corvettes, but even among those this ’66 convertible is something special."

GM officially rated output at 425-horsepower, a figure which trounced many competitors. Matched up to it is a four-speed manual, so as you can imagine this is one fun car to take around town. What’s more, under the hood everything is incredibly clean, with chrome valve covers and air cleaner for an impressive presentation."

While any 1966 Corvette will definitely turn heads, the paint and chrome on this one are about as close to perfection as you can get. Every small detail from the turn signals to the badges is immaculate. There’s even a black soft top with zero signs of fading or tearing. Gold line radials just add that icing to what’s already an "
