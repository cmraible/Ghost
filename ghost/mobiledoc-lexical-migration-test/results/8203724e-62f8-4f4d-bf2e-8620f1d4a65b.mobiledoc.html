<hr>
<p>If you’re like us, owning and operating a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-car-museum-owner/">classic car museum</a> would be a dream come true, like how normies fantasize about owning a charming bed and breakfast in some picturesque mountain valley somewhere. That’s why our ears perked up when we first heard that a classic car museum is looking for someone to run and manage it. The only catch is it’s in Chandigarh, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mumbai-likes-american-muscle/">India</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn about a cool, new classic car museum in Colorado <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/orphanage-car-museum-colorado/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>We don’t entirely understand all the legalities of the situation, which is explained to some extent in a local English-language report. However, it sounds like what’s being looked for is a company to run and manage the museum which is already in existence. Could that company be a sole proprietorship? We don’t know, but it’s something you might want to explore.</p>
<p>Think about it: you get to run a museum full of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/orphanage-car-museum-colorado/">cool classic cars</a>. Oh, and apparently there’s vintage furniture in it for reasons we also don’t really understand. And in the photo it looks like some old guns are also included in the collection. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>Ok, we admit the fact you’re not going to be playing with some cool <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/farm-classic-mopar-muscle-cars/">classic muscle cars</a> is a huge drawback. That and it sounds like you won’t own the joint. Plus there are probably some interesting laws and regulations you’d have to navigate. But other than that, this could be an opportunity of a lifetime!</p>
<p>The alternative would be to start your own car museum where you live or at least somewhere in this country. It can be done, just it requires <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/orphanage-car-museum-colorado/">a lot of money and patience</a>. It also helps if you have a good angle, not just some random collection of classic cars, because there already are plenty of those kinds of car museums.</p>
