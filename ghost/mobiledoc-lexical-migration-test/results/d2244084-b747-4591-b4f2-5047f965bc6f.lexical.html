<hr>
<p>If you’re like us, you’re avoiding watching anything news-related these days. It’s that time of the year/news cycle where everything is urgent, hysterical, rage-inducing, and a lot of other hot garbage we’d rather not deal with. Normally, we watch a lot of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/paul-walkers-nissan-skyline-r34/">car-related things online</a>, but with what’s going on lately we’ve been going for the guilty pleasures like this video of a guy restoring a toy version of Dominic Toretto’s Dodge Charger from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lykan-hypersport-fast-furious/"><em>The Fast and the Furious</em></a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, we get it: some of you were wanting to see the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-movie/">movie car restored</a>. One of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-chevelle-fast-furious/">Chevelles from the movies</a> was sold recently and it looks pretty rough, so maybe the new owner will do a restoration and post a video sometime. Until then, we get to watch this old model get a full restoration.</p>
<p>Someone really abused this model. The video description says it’s an abandoned car, but just like with some advertised barn finds, we’re not entirely sure this wasn’t staged at least to an extent. In any case, Dom’s Charger <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/saleen-mustang-2fast-2furious/">looks awful</a> with a thick patina of rust/dirt, missing paint all over the body, a door completely ripped off, the other door is pretty much falling off, the taillights are missing, the trunk lid looks jacked up, and more.</p>
<p>This guy really gets into restoring toys. Not only does he do an excellent, thorough job so the Dodge Charger looks fantastic, he also has a toy Dominic Toretto for some cool shots at the beginning and end. He even poses the figure with the car, so it’s a big deal.</p>
<p>As you watch the guy work, it’s strangely <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fast-five-replicas/">soothing and satisfying</a>. Hey, we like restoring cars, bikes, and pretty much anything else. Apparently, restoring old toy cars is something else we enjoy. Who knew?</p>
