<hr>
<p>In the first half of the 20th century, Packard had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorious-as-we-creep-into-fall/">a well-deserved reputation</a> for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/elvis-purple-1956-cadillac/">luxury</a>, quality, and reliability. That reputation has remained nearly unmatched in the years since the company folded in 1958.</p>

<p>The company is perhaps best known for their opulent prewar cars, but after World War II, they made several attempts at returning to relevance. The 1953-1956 Packard Carribbean may be one of the most elegant last ditch efforts of all time.</p>
<p>Jay Leno has owned his for over 35 years, and apparently, it was once featured in the opening of The Tonight Show. His is a 1955 model, which featured several mechanical and styling updates that made it special.</p>

<p>The 1955 Carribbean featured self-leveling torsion beam suspension, which Leno shows off in the video by sitting on the rear quarter panel and jumping off. After a couple seconds, we hear the mechanism whir to life as the car levels back out to compensate for the weight. Pretty heady stuff for 1955.</p>
<p>Another cool feature is the dual antennas. Dual radio antennas were a popular custom feature back in the '50s, but the second antenna was usually non-functional. The Carribbean had both wired in, which gave the car an impressively clear radio signal. Think of it as the SiriusXM shark fin of the '50s.</p>

<p>Leno's car is extra special to him as it's all original, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/patina-restomod-truck/">down to the paint</a>. From the video, it looks good, but as he explains, it's no show car. In 1955 and 1956, Carribbeans could be had with tri-tone paint (Leno's is two-tone). The interior upholstery matched, and in 1956, the cushions were reversible â€“ cloth on one side, leather on the other.</p>
<p>Back in the 1950s, driving a Caribbean meant that you were someone important. That looks to remain the case today, over 60 years later. </p>
