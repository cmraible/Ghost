<p>If this van looks like a blast from the past, that's because it was just recently pulled from a long-term slumber, and apparently there are just 37,000 original miles on it. This Dodge has just about everything you could expect from a '70s van including the roof vent, windshield visor, mag wheels and the wheel and front bumper extensions. All that's missing are opera windows.</p>
<p>On the outside, things get started with a dark blue coat of paint, and then someone when to town with an airbrush gun adding the shaggy dogs, a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle and, yes, even a picture of the van. It doesn't get much more meta than to airbrush a picture of a custom van onto the hood of said custom van! It looks like someone was watching a little too much Bob Ross when the happy little trees were added.</p>
<p>Things get even funkier on the inside with patriotic front seats, a button-tufted engine cover and shag carpet on the floor, walls and roof. The front seats swivel toward the back transforming the van into a groovy hangout, which also includes a fold-out bed, refrigerator and a television suspended from the roof.</p>
