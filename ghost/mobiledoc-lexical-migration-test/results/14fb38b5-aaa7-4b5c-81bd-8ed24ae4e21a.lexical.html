<p>For maximum track safety, this 2002 has been fitted with a full bolt-in roll cage, FIA-approved racing seats, racing harnesses and a fire suppression system. The center stack has all the controls for the kill switch, fuel pump and ignition, and the battery has been relocated to the trunk with a battery cut-off switch.</p>
<p>Safety is only half of what it takes to turn a street car into a track car, and this 1972 BMW 2002 has received a host of handling and performance upgrades as well. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder was bored .040 over and was beefed up with high-compression pistons, BMW E12 head and a Schrick camshaft, this car also has a Weber carburetor, upgraded cooling system and electronic ignition. The suspension was enhanced with coilovers, front and rear strut braces and polyurethane bushings, while the big front brake kit and stainless steel brake lines help ensure that this car will stop as good as it will corner.</p>
