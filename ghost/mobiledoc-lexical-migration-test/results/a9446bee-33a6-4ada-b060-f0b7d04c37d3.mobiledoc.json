          "According to Mass.gov, \"Unlike many states and nations, emissions in Massachusetts do not primarily come from large industrial or agricultural operations,\" adding \"Over 65% of Massachusettsâ€™ emissions come from our cars, trucks, homes, and offices; another 20% comes from the power plants that provide electricity for our lights, computers, and appliances.\" Curiously enough, the Decarbonization Roadmap pins 27-percent of that on cars and trucks, so 38-percent from housing is, interesting. In further interesting math, the push to reduce carbon emissions via EVs is going to reduce the state's emissions by 45-percent. Interestingly enough, the potent impact of airplanes isn't addressed on the site, but maybe Massachusetts has become a no-fly zone since I last booked a flight. "

In the past 30 years (generously, because we could start counting back in the 1800's), the only real impressive performance vehicles have come out of Tesla, but most people have little desire to drive a fast iPad to the track, or weekend cruises. The Mach-E seems somewhat promising, but its about as pleasant as a dentist drill when driven aggressively. There's a long road ahead to get to the point where enthusiasts are going to truly enjoy electric-powered anything, and that's coming from a path of "
