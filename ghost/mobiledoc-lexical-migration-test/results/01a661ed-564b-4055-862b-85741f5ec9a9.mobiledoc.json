Touring is a vital part of their history as the brand has undertaken many adventures on long-form racing circuits. This incredible ability is not only limited to racing, and sports cars, as the information, learned by Mercedes engineers, has been applied to virtually every one of their models.

Adding to the specialized paint job, you also get a set of dark steel wheels that create an unsuspecting aesthetic for the incredible vehicle. However, you won't find nearly the same subtlety on the inside of the RV because Mercedes made sure that their customers were taken care of. The most prominent evidence of this dedication to style, luxury, and comfort can be found in the lounge area and bed space meticulously crafted to create a comfortable relaxation experience. You might be wondering about the integrity of the RV as a vehicle, and we can assure you that this motorhome has been thoroughly optioned out to make it highly reliable and versatile."

This lets you have some fun outside your RV and inside as it opens the possibility for lighting up the outdoors or even could help in an emergency situation. This is controlled by a touch screen affixed to the dash, which makes you the captain of everything that happens on your new ship. Overall, this great RV is the perfect vehicle for a "
