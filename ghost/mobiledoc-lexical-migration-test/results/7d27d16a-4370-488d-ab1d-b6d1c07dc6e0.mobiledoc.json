Using the VIN, the truck's ties to Elvis were authenticated by Elvis Presley Enterprises earlier this year, and the GMC underwent a frame-on/bed-off restoration about four years ago.

It is a short bed truck with an inline-six engine and a manual transmission, and it is sold with a copy of the bill of sale where Elvis' dad had sold the truck to a dealership in Maryland. Since 1986, the truck has been on display at museums in Canada and across the Southeastern U.S. before being restored to its original glory. This classic GMC looks incredible, and the listing says that it drives just as good."
