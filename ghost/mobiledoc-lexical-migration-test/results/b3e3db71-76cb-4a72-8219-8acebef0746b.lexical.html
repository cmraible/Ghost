<p>In the past several years, a growing number of automakers have established and are pushing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1960s-toyota-race-car/">factory restoration programs</a>. Part of the reason for this is these can be profitable operations, bringing in much-needed revenue at a time when the industry is only getting more competitive. However, that’s not the only reason for these programs, as clearly demonstrated by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-the-official-porsche-birthday-party-unfold/">Porsche</a> bragging about restoring the first 911 S <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ionic-cars-964-porsche-911-electric/">Targa</a> delivered in Germany.</p>

<p>This historically-significant car wasn’t babied and cherished in the years following its sale. Sadly, after it made its way over to the US, the Porsche was parked in a doorless garage and sat for almost 4 decades. Yes, this was a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-two-barn-find-classic-porsches-get-rescued/">barn find car</a> an enthusiast thankfully rescued, but it was in really sad shape.</p>

<p>Being smart, Porsche saw this as an opportunity to highlight its factory restoration program and the history of the 911 Targa. That’s the thing with these programs, they not only help bring in additional revenue which would’ve flowed to independent shops, they help build brand loyalty and increase the image of the company. Everyone who sees this beautifully restored Porsche will be mesmerized with how amazing the classic models are and that’s invaluable marketing these days.</p>

<p>It took a whopping 3-plus years to fully restore this Porsche 911 S Targa. As the automaker points out in a lengthy press release, this car had a soft rear window instead of the glass which Porsche switched to after too long. In fact, only 925 units with the upgraded S engine were made with the soft window from 1966 to 1968, so that alone makes this car quite rare and definitely worthy of a full restoration.</p>

<p>Like most other factory restoration programs, Porsche’s is based on the philosophy of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-finally-added-a-901/">keeping the car as original as possible</a>. That means the process is slower and more methodical. However, the result is this Polo Red vintage Porsche looks absolutely amazing.</p>
