We receive press releases promoting this idea so often, it’s become a running joke. So it really didn’t surprise us that nobody bid on GM’s 2023 C8 Z06 Corvette recently. In fact, it made us laugh out loud."

After all, it looks like the newest addition to the Z06 legacy will be a hot property, along with the rest of the C8 lineup. It’s not possible the enthusiasm for GM’s mid-engine Corvette is waning at all, is it? That seems unlikely."
