Thanks to a combination of extreme rarity, growing affluence among millennials, and the infamous 25 year rule, cars like this one are seeing values absolutely skyrocket in North America, even though they’re not exactly cheap elsewhere."

Sure, there are those who will argue all day the R35 is superior and they have some valid points, but the market is heavily tilted in favor of the R34. Admittedly, here in the US that’s partly due to the forbidden fruit phenomena as everyone eagerly awaits for the 25 year rule to allow widespread admittance of these Godzillas. The few who have been able to procure one and legally import it into the country."
