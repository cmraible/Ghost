<hr>
<p>Even though Ford has unveiled the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-bronco-comparison/">all-new 2021 Ford Bronco</a>, this off-roading SUV won't be on sale until early next year. That's a long time to hold off on the purchase of a new vehicle, but enthusiasts can take solace in the fact that this SUV has some serious <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/off-road/">off-road</a> capabilities. Recently, a trio of new Broncos was spotted testing on the Jeep <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-bronco-almost-named-the-wrangler/">Wrangler</a>'s unofficial proving ground – California's Rubicon Trail – and <em>Bronco6g.com</em> got plenty of pictures and videos.</p>

<p>The 22-mile Rubicon Trail offers some of the toughest trails in the country, and these Ford engineers drew quite a crowd as three versions of the new Bronco showed off their off-road prowess. The video shows a four-door Bronco make it almost over an obstacle before having to back down and try another line. It isn't clear if the driver is being given directions off camera or if the driver is relying on the Bronco's 360-degree off-road camera system.</p>
<p>While there were images and videos of camouflaged Broncos testing before the SUV's July 13th debut, this is the first time we are getting to see the new Bronco testing in plain sight. The three Broncos that were photographed included both two- and four-door models, and two of the Broncos were equipped with 33-inch tires while the third Sasquatch Package that includes 35-inch tires. Two of the test vehicles had beadlock wheels, and the images also show the Bronco in various levels of top/door removal.</p>
<p>Head over to <em>Bronco6g.com</em> to check out all of the pictures of these Broncos testing, which basically looks like a staged marketing photo shoot.</p>
