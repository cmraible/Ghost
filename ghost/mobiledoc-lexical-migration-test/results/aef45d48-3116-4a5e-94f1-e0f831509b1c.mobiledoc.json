Relocating the spare tire to the bed isn’t really one of them since plenty of people do that to try looking cool. Instead, those dual tailpipes and the rear axle are practically enthusiast calling cards. As for the Demon badges on the front fenders, you’d hope someone who has the gall to put those on their vehicle also dropped the engine under the hood, but that’s not always the case."
