<p>The Chevrolet Chevelle SS is easily one of the most popular muscle cars from the era of high-performance muscle powered by big-block V8s. Although unknown at the time, the 1969 model year was edging closer to the demise of the movement with the oil crisis looming on the horizon that would cause people to buy smaller cars for fuel efficiency. Here we have a beautiful example of a <a href="https://www.ironplanet.com/for-sale/Automobiles-1969-Chevrolet-Chevelle-SS-Convertible-Nevada/4008269?h=5002%2Cmsg%7C53701%2CisAuc%7Cyes&rr=0.16667&hitprm=&pnLink=yes?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 Convertible</a><strong></strong>heading to online auction (with reserve) during the Iron Planet's <a href="https://www.ironplanet.com/jsp/auction/auction_info.jsp?groupId=53701?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Leake Virtual Live Auction</a> on Monday, August 31st (Eastern Standard Time). </p>

<p>This classic Chevelle convertible was originally painted Fathom Green, but it was resprayed in another factory hue of Tuxedo Black (GM Code 10) during its frame-off restoration with no expense spared that was completed in 2012. On all four corners sits 14-inch Super Sport wheels with polished trim rings and clad with Firestone Wide Oval rubber. </p>
<p>As it says in the title, powering this old-school Chevelle convertible is a L35 396-cubic-inch big-block V8 engine finished in correct Chevy Orange and topped with a Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor. The engine has the correct casting number (3955272) and is also equipped with a cast intake and a fresh points distributor. A Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 automatic transmission shifts power down to the rear wheels by twisting a 12-bolt Posi-traction rear axle. Sitting a top a highly detailed chassis, the Chevelle features a 4-link rear suspension, fresh coil springs, and new KYB shocks. Stopping is provided by fully rebuilt power front disc brakes with rear drums.</p>
<p>Open the doors to an immaculate red interior that adds the perfect pop of color against its dark exterior. The bucket seats have been rebuilt, and brand new carpeting has been laid down throughout the cabin. Also inside is a deluxe instrument panel, a vintage looking digital tuner, and chrome horseshoe shifter. </p>
