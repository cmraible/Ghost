However, what Rachel Speight lacked in know-how she made up for with sheer determination. Ultimately, she not only tracked down her stolen car but found several others."

She also posted hundreds of flyers in the area and drove around hunting for any sign of it. That effort paid off because she recognized the Mercedes sitting in a vacant lot, specifically focusing on the awards from her grandchildren hanging from the rearview mirror."

Searching through the other vehicles, authorities found purses, IDs, and other valuables thieves had stolen."

While it’s true thieves often know how to disable factory trackers, using an aftermarket setup, or even better a couple of them, will give you an edge. Often, thieves will dump the vehicles somewhere public for a few days to see if you track your ride down, instead of leading you right to a chop shop or something like that. In other words, a tracker can help you get your vehicle back almost immediately."
