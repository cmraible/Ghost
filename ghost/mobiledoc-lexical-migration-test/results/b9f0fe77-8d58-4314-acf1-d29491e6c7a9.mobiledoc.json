After all, the authorities might think this is something far more expensive, what with that flashy body and such. Just like everyone at the tennis club, they could easily mistake it for a Ferrari or even a Lamborghini if they squinted at it in the dark and never looked at the VIN. Also, importing a car from Europe or anywhere can be a fun process of cutting through red tape, and we’re 100% sure this vehicle isn’t worth the effort."
