          "In 1991, Black Horse Garage was founded by Frank Buonanno, a deep-rooted exotic car enthusiast, master engine rebuilder, and mechanic specializing in European sports cars. It all started thanks to one Italian automaker - Ferrari. Frank stepped up and rebuilt the engine in his dad's Ferrari at just 15 years old, and that's when he uncovered a natural gift of working on exotic vehicles and the motivation and perseverance to follow a newly found dream. It wasn't long after that Frank was under the wings of the world's top Ferrari mechanics, and he worked hard to perfect his skills down to a science. "

Frank opened an automotive repair shop and restoration business in Miami, Florida, before ultimately ending up in Bridgeport, CT with Black Horse Garage. With 45 years of luxury and exotic car restoration under his belt, Frank has received endless national awards from the most prestigious European Sports Car Events. "
