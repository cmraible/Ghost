<hr>
<p>Ford's GT supercar is an incredible, state-of-the-art machine. Regardless, even after it was released, Ford engineers looked for ways to <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">squeeze even more performance</a> out of the already potent GT.</p>
<p>After some hard-fought race success, Ford released the GT Competition Series to commemorate their victories. These cars featured <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">several weight-saving measures</a>, employing materials such as carbon fiber and titanium. Thinner glass was always used.</p>

<p>Major weight savings, though, came from removing the Ford GT's <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">creature comforts</a>, such as the air conditioning, stereo system, and even the cupholders. For some, this was a bridge too far.</p>
<p>As a compromise, Ford built <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">a limited number of Lightweight models</a>, which included all of the weight saving measures but retained the infotainment system and air conditioning of the standard car.</p>

Even the steering wheel was lightened – then wrapped in alcantara.</p>
<p>The original owner of this car special ordered it from a dealership in Sebring, Florida. Upon delivery, they had a shop professionally apply paint protection film. Inexplicably, the owner never drove it – there's <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">just 8.2 delivery miles</a> on the odometer.</p>

<p> We hope that the next owner gets to enjoy <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">this rare machine</a> more than the current one. Of course, given the price of these cars, it's no surprised that they were a little hesitant to turn it loose on the street.</p>
<p>Still, we can't imagine anything more fun than getting groceries in <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">a 200 MPH supercar</a> – then taking the long way back home. If that sounds appealing to you, your chance is coming up.</p>
<p>This Ford GT will be auctioned off by <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0029-2019-ford-gt-lightweight/1015400?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">RM Sotheby's</a> as part of their Arizona 2021 sale. This car will cross the block on January 22.</p>
