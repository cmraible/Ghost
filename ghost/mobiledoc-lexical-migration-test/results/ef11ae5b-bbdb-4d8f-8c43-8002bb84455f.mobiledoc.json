Unfortunately for a man in Kyoto, Japan he did just that. It gets worse: his job is to help preserve cultural heritage cites like the toilet at Tofukuji, a Buddhist temple which draws in many visitors wishing to bask in its beauty."

We don’t know if the thing has a rotary shifter like what you find in some modern American cars, but if it does then it’s no wonder the guy couldn’t tell the transmission was in Reverse and not Drive. Those rotary gear selectors need to be banned forever because they cause plenty of Code Brown moments like this one."
