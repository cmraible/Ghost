<hr>
<p>Jaden Chalmers was an 18-year-old with a love of cars and close relationship with his little brother, Brandon. Jaden was a good big brother who knew how to listen to his little brother, and they both had a passion for vintage cars and trucks. Several years ago, the boys uncovered a 1988 Chevrolet Caprice Classic Brougham on their uncle’s estate, and now it’s up to the little brother to restore it.</p>

<p>"It was used in the 1988 Olympics as a ferry car for all the judges and the officials," Brandon said. "My brother said that was the car he wanted to work on.”</p>
<p>The brother would start digging into their new labor of love, until Jaden died in a car accident in September. Now faced with the loss of his brother, Brandon has decided that the car they were going to restore together will still go on to get a proper overhaul to return it to its former glory, giving Brandon a new sense of purpose.</p>

<p>"I decided, as a tribute car, I'm going to build the car that he wanted to build and I'm going to finish it for him.”</p>
<p>Friends are going to jump in and help out too, and a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jaden-chalmers">GoFundMe</a> has been established to help pay for some of the work.</p>
<p>"I've already prepped the hood [and under it] I'm going to get a picture [of Jaden]," he said. "It will be like a memorial picture and because I do a lot of car meets, when I park it, I can flip up the hood and it will have a picture of him right? It will be like he's always with me."</p>
