<hr>
<p>On the afternoon of April 20, deputies in Miami County, Kansas responded to an odd call about a car landing on a house’s roof. What they found when they arrived was truly bizarre. A 2018 Dodge Charger was laying on its passenger side in a house’s backyard, the driver stuck inside. However, it was quickly determined 29-year-old Burgandy Rose Thomas of Peculiar, Missouri was dead.</p>

<p>According to authorities, Thomas was speeding down 223rd Street when she crossed railroad tracks and lost control of the Mopar. Her car veered into a ditch and was launched into the air. It hit a tree before striking the roof of the house, finally coming to rest in the backyard.</p>

<p>Two people were in the house during the crash. Thankfully, they weren’t injured. It’s a miracle there wasn’t another vehicle in the road, someone in the yard, etc. to add to the carnage. This could have been so much worse.</p>
<p>Normally, we’d have some sort of joke about The Wizard of Oz or something silly like that, but since this was a fatal crash we’ll abstain. This whole matter is no laughing matter – it’s a reminder of the awesome power cars pack. Unfortunately, the driver of the Charger didn’t respect the machine and its capabilities, paying with her life.</p>
<p>This is truly a sad and unnecessary situation. There’s a reason railroad crossings are usually marked by signs and you should take those slow and cautiously. Also, speeding on roads you’re not familiar with is a good way to end up in a world of hurt before you even know what’s going on.</p>
