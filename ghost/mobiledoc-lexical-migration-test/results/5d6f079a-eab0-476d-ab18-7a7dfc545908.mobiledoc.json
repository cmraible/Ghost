With that being said, this setup does not come close to being maxed out. With a safe tune and a tank full of 91-octane pump gas, Joel’s Chevelle puts around 800-horsepower to the ground. Backing the beefy new powerhouse is a T-56 Magnum 6-speed transmission that feeds a Curry rear end with a 3.88:1 gear ratio."

The pair rip through the streets in the red 1970 Chevelle and end the ride by peeling some of the rubber off the tires. It’s hard to miss the mixture of fear and joy that washes over the hosts face as the Chevy’s 3 ½-inch Magnaflow exhaust screams. It is possible he might think twice about getting in the car if Joel comes back on the show after the E-85 conversion or a water-meth injection system is installed."
