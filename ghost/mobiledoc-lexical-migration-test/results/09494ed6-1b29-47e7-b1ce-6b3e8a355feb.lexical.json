The opening hours are a total pain in the neck, if I’m being honest. The controls are clumsy and the framerate is very inconsistent. Trying to walk anywhere feels like a chore and there is little to no direction, which means you’ll likely spend a lot of time wandering in circles and getting very confused about where to go or what to do. After the awkward stage is over, things get better, albeit only slightly. Eventually, you’ll get the hang of walking and that’s one less annoyance but even then, there are spots where the game itself just can’t function properly.
