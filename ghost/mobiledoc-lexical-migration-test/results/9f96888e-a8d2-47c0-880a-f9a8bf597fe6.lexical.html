<p>Like The Doctor in <em>Doctor Who</em>, every now and again, the <a href="http://www.interhacktives.com">Interhacktives website</a> falls over, and then gets up looking different, with a changed outlook on life. Except The Doctor does this at irregular intervals. And Interhacktives does it once a year.</p>
<p>Abandoning metaphor.</p>
<p>Interhacktives is a website run by the <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/interactive-journalism">MA students in Interactive Journalism</a> at City University, and is “supervised” by myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/benwhitelaw">Ben Whitelaw of <em>The Times</em></a> in the Social Media & Content Strategy module I run. It’s a site that the students are expected to run themselves, and which contributes towards their assessment at the end of the module next year.</p>
<p>This year’s design is nice, clean and fresh looking:</p>

<h2 id="getting-responsive">Getting responsive</h2>
<p>And, finally, it’s fully responsive. (Last year’s design had a mobile theme, but not a responsive design.) This is the new look on iPad:</p>

<h2 id="mobile-ready">Mobile-ready</h2>
<p>And on iPhone:</p>

<h2 id="a-personal-touch">A personal touch</h2>
<p>One touch I really like is the nice, clear and consistently designed <a href="http://www.interhacktives.com/about/">authors page</a>:</p>

<p>Only one <a href="http://www.interhacktives.com/2014/11/18/6-best-news-sites-data-journalism-uk/">actual new article</a> up so far – but I’m looking forwards to seeing what they do with the site.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
