<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Here it is, our <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/53ef968adb857a18ee5#/"><strong>biggest discount of the year</strong></a>:</p>
<p>That’s right, we’re offering our free subscribers a 20 percent off an annual subscription to <em>The Daily Poster</em> — but this discount is only available to the first 50 people who click the link in the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Here’s why we’re doing this: Right now, Congress is gearing up for a major battle over the sprawling reconciliation package, which could put in place the most ambitious social and climate policies the country has ever seen. While progressives have pledged to hold out to get these measures passed, corporate interests are spending millions to kill the legislation.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1445559997421608965?s=20">reporting on corruption</a> has had a <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1444001859480469519?s=20">major impact</a> on this battle, and we aim to expand our coverage that holds progressives to their promises and exposes corporate villains trying to kill the initiatives.</p>
