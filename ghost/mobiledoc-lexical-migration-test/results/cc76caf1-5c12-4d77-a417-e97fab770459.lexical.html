<hr>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/32858/2013-porsche-911-carrera-s">George Shinn collection</a> consists of a mix of vehicles like a 2013 Porsche 911 Carrera S and a 1970 Mercedes 280SL to several outstanding Ford Galaxies, Bel Airs, and <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/32861/1968-ford-mustang-shelby-500-continuation-car">Mustangs</a>. </p>
<p>Shinn is best known for creating Charlotte Hornets in 1988 and later moving the team to New Orleans in 2002. <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/32860/2010-ford-mustang-iacocca-edition">His love of cars started</a> at a young age while washing cars as a kid at his dad's Gulf service station. The self-proclaimed gearhead says that he ran out of room with "a little over a hundred cars" in his collection, which is why he is sending these vehicles off to new homes.</p>
<p>Like any other collector, Shinn has purchased cars many of the cars from all of the major auction houses, and he feels "more at peace, comfort and trust" using GAA Classic Cars for this collection.</p>
<p>"GAA Classic Cars is an organization of good people. They have a history with cars, they know what they're doing and they know what people like and want, and they fill that need," Shinn said.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
