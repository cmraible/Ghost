Give it to me!</em></p>\n<p><em>TT: Well, I’d like to have one too if it’s about what we want.</em></p>\n<p><em>YS: Well, Taura-kun’s Twitter account is shown on the screen here and if everyone asks him for it, then there may be a possibility that it would become a reality. But even if it does, it might be about two years from now again. See we keep our jobs alive by releasing a little by little.</em></p>\n<p><em>TT: Yes, we try to stretch it out as much as possible.</em></p>\n<p><em>YT: And this Twitter account is for asking for new girlfriends too right?</em></p>\n<p><em>TT: Well, yes, but please contact Saito-san about Switch and not me.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you heard the man, go on Twitter and be as loud as possible about a Switch port!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Would you like to see Nier: Automata on Switch?
