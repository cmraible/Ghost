<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week, <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs podcasts are delivering some much-needed historical context. On <em>Lever Time</em>, I explore what led to the recent airline meltdown with the help of William J. McGee, one of the leading experts in airline deregulation. Together we delve into the history of how U.S. airline carriers became hyper-concentrated, why their customer service is so abysmal, and why literally only one person (the Secretary of Transportation) has the power to do anything about it.</p>
<p>On <em>The Audit</em>, the study group continues slogging through David Axelrod and Karl Rove‚Äôs MasterClass on political campaigns. Most notably, they discussed how Axelrod fawns over former President Ronald Reagan as part of a broader historical whitewashing effort. Long story short: All of these awful people are trying hard to make you forget how awful they are.</p>

<p>In the new episode of our ‚Äúeducational‚Äù series <em>The Audit</em>, Dave, Josh, and their study buddy Senator Nina Turner audit the next seven lessons of David Axelrod and Karl Rove‚Äôs 24-part MasterClass on campaign strategy and messaging.

<p>For some inexplicable reason, this week David Axelrod gushes over former President Ronald Reagan, which prompts the study group to discuss whether these people actually believe in anything other than being a part of some whitewashed version of history. On top of that, Senator Nina Turner dishes on why she doesn‚Äôt hang out with her counterparts in the Beltway.</p>
