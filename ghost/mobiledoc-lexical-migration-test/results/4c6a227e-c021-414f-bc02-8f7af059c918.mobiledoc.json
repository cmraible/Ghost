Not only does it provide absolutely brutal acceleration, its placement ensures better handling than most would expect from a car like this. A 6-speed manual transmission will please the driving purists who know the joys of the third pedal."

The Very Orange Pearlcoat looks absolutely immaculate in the photos and we can imagine it would be even more impressive in person. Factory painted white stripes have aged excellently, plus this is 1 of 9 of these cars ever made with this option. Everything on the car is original, including the chrome five-spoke SRT wheels, so you’re not dealing with someone else’s questionable tastes in aftermarket modifications."
