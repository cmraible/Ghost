<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been releasing movies since 2008. Since then, the comic book-based movies have been ever-popular with the along with the actors/actresses. Onscreen, there have been some iconic Marvel vehicles some topped with superchargers that would give the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/batmobile-history/">Batmobile</a> a run for its money. So, what do the MCU stars <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/">drive</a> when they're not on camera? </p>

<p>Hiddleston played the character Loki in the Marvel franchise. He purchased a Peugeot 106 1.1 after getting his big break in Hollywood and drove the car for years. The actor began making appearances in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/steve-coogan-jaguar-e-type/">Jaguar</a> commercials, so soon he upgraded to a Jaguar F-Type that he "temporarily owns". </p>
<h3 id="8-elizabeth-olsen-toyota-prius">8. Elizabeth Olsen - Toyota Prius</h3>
<p>Olsen, who plays Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff in the Marvel films, likes to keep her carbon footprint minimal in a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1992-winnebago-warrior-toyota/"><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1992-winnebago-warrior-toyota/">Toyot</a>a</a> Prius.

<p>Ruffalo, also known as MCU's Bruce Banner, drives a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/features/393933/volvo-amazon-custom-jeff-allen">Volvo</a> station wagon as his daily driver. It's unclear whether this is a V60 or a V90. Although, Ruffalo did admit that he was number 6,345 on the list for a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/p/e1e9c77b-beae-4c26-b0e6-e04d9b375fa1/motorious.com/articles/news/first-gen-tesla-roadsters/">Tesla Coupe S</a>.</p>

<p>Mackie, the actor behind Falcon, drives a 2010 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/baywatch-dodge-challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a>. Unfortunately, he was arrested after driving this same car in 2013 after he appeared to be driving intoxicated. </p>

<p>Chris Hemsworth plays the one-and-only Thor. A family man, him and wife Elsa Pataky own an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1100-hp-audi-rs3-catches-fire/">Audi</a> Q7. This also makes sense because Hemsworth is a brand ambassador for Audi Australia.</p>

<p>Chadwick Boseman's stardom began when he was cast as the Black Panther in the MCU film. When he received his first paycheck, he purchased a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/393635/one-of-a-kind-2021-lexus-lc-500-vert-sells-for-2-million">Lexus LC 500h </a>that reportedly cost about $150,000.</p>

<p>Scarlett Johansson also keeps it practical considering she is a parent. Her daily driver is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/michael-jordans-mercedes-s600/">Mercedes-Benz</a> GLE 350. Back in June, she was spotted in The Hamptons cleaning the vehicle. The new 2020 GLE 350 starts out at $54,250 and is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an output of 255-horsepower and 273 lb/ft of torque.</p>

<p>Chris Evans, who plays Captain America, has worked closely with Robert Downey Jr., who plays Iron Man, and the two have developed a close friendship.

Even better, the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/300251/1967-chevrolet-camaro-ss-convertible">Camaro</a> was also modified by SpeedKore, a carbon fiber company.</p>
<p>According to an Edmunds spokesperson, the cost of the wheels, suspension, engine, seats, supercharger, and gauges by themselves would total about $33,000.</p>

<p>Downey admitted that its way more fun than Tony Stark's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-audi-r8-hpe900-exotic/">Audi R8</a> in the movie. We just recently wrote about the SpeedKore-modified 1970 BMW 3.0 CS built for Robert Downey, Jr.</p>
