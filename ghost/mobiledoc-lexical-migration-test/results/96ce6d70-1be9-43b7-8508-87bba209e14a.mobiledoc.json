          " is typically thought of as America’s best era when it comes to muscle cars, until the 1973 oil crisis and subsequent skyrocketing of gas prices created some of the ugliest and most under powered cars known to America at the time. However, despite the obvious financial burden, one aspect of motorsport gained quite a lot of traction; that aspect was drag racing. This was a fun cheap way for people to hang out with other enthusiasts and light up some rubber along the way in a time when car people didn't have anywhere else to go. Eventually, this translated into Pro Stock drag racing and many teams started to pop up, one such team was called “Mopar Missiles.”"
