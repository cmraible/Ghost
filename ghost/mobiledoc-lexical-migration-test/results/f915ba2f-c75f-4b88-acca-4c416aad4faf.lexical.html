<hr>
<p>There are collector cars out there living better than most of us. While some of have mental images of a luxury parking somewhere in Los Angeles - much like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/matt-farah-storage/">large facility created by Matt Farah</a> that will open its doors. This time, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mr-bean-has-superc/">car collection</a> that has better living accommodations than most of us is located in Wisconsin where a man had transformed a carriage house into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/secretly-transforms-muscle-cars/">ultimate garage</a> to house his beloved rides. </p>

<p>This home-turned-garage created by Wade Weissmann Architecture took over two years to complete. The space was designed to display 3 cars at one time, but will fit up to four if the cars are tightly arranged. Even more, there is a showroom equipped with tall ceilings with unique and custom details including tall carriage garage doors overhead custom-designed for the cars to enter in and out. Here, a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen</a> can be seen as well as a new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/clapton-ferraris/">Ferrari</a> and a few exotics in his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/exotic-car-collections-arent-cheap-to-own/">collection</a> that call this place home.</p>
<p>If someone has the financial means to collect high-dollar<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/140-car-collection-heading-to-auction-this-fall/"> collector cars</a>, then they certainly can afford to create a space for them to reside. Inside the house is a spacious area that. includes the aforementioned three display bays with a fourth detailing bay within eyesight. In addition, an English conservatory with an attached bar provides the perfect place to host events and entertain guests.</p>
<p>Inside, the carriage home is aesthetically pleasing laid with a unique aggregate concrete floor while custom cabinets add the perfect touch. The interior's walls are created out of custom windows made of steel, and doors with wired glass.</p>
<p>Inside this house garage there is an upstairs that features a living room suite, a custom full kitchen, and a fireplace. Exterior-wise, a slate roof sits atop the house accented by a cupola and gutters made out of custom copper. Even more, the exterior has veneers made of stone with horizontal lap siding. </p>
