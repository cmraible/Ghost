It was the name given to an intermediate-sized automobile that was built and sold by AMC (American Motors Corporation) from 1961 through 1966. Upon its initial introduction, the Rambler featured six-passenger four-door sedan and station wagon versions. And right here right now, you can get your hands on a 1963 AMC Rambler Wagon 770 Cross Country LS model."
