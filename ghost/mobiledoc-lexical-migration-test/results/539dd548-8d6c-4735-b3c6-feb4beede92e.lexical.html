These cars are more than worthy of a new garage, and we're thrilled to be able to share our picks with the readers each week. Here is a list of cars to check out as we roll into the middle of April.</p>

<p>Each example of this limited edition run would start out in the usual <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/SC0521-462370/2020-ford-gt-mkii/">Ford GT</a> plant before being transported to Multimatic to be transformed into the ultimate unrestricted track-only Ford GT MKII. From there modifications made by hand to the cars twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine would boost power output to 700-horsepower while Multimatic’s DSSV dampers, race-derived aerodynamics, and enlarged Brembo 4-wheel carbon ceramic brakes allow the car tracking ability like it never has had before. Production is planned to last three years with a total of just 45 cars to be made.</p>

<p>Number nine of the 30 examples produced ended up in stock at Sisson Pre-Owned of Uniontown, Pennsylvania where it was raffled off to a Veteran, effectively raising nearly $100,000 to benefit Rescue 22. This veteran believed in the charity that the raffle benefited so much that he turned right back around and donated the car back to Sisson Pre-Owned so that it could raise more money for the charity. This car is now for sale at Carlisle Auctions’ Spring Event and all proceeds from its sale will go directly to Rescue 22 to help them help America’s Veterans.</p>

<h3 id="drag-strip-monster-1970-challenger-pushes-8-seconds-in-the-quarter-mile">Drag Strip Monster 1970 Challenger Pushes 8-Seconds In The Quarter Mile</h3>

<p>Under the hood of this high horsepower behemoth of a 1970 Challenger is a monstrous Hemi V8 equipped with a 110-mm turbocharger. With extremely thick rear tires, a tubed rear end, and a full race spec roll cage, it is impossible to suspect this car as anything less than a full-blown race car. The aforementioned mods are an absolute necessity due to the ridiculously low quarter-mile time and insane horsepower number that this thing pushes out.</p>
