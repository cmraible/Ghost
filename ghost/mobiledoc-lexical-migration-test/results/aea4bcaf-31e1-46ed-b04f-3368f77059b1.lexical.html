<p>There was no doubt in our minds before that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2018-cadillac-cts-v/">Cadillac CTS-V is modern classic</a>. If you’ve been privileged enough to buy one, you know what a riot they are. And while some consider the wagons to be the ugly ducklings of the bunch, the fact is they have a dedicated, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-wagon-hits-200-mph/">almost cult-like following</a>. Perhaps that helps to explain why a 2012 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cadillac-xlr-turnaround-sports-car/">Cadillac</a> CTS-V Wagon recently sold for $89,500 on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/what-happened-to-ebay-motors/">Bring A Trailer</a>.</p>

<p>It probably didn’t hurt one bit that this go-fast wagon has under 12,000 miles showing on the odometer and looks super clean outside and in. The Caddie also comes with a 6-speed manual transmission, a perk you’re hard-pressed to find on a shocking number of modern performance cars.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of other colors out there, we think the Opulent Blue Metallic paint suits this CTS-V Wagon perfectly. It pairs nicely with the 19-inch Satin Graphite wheels with yellow brake calipers peeking through, as well as the Ebony leather interior with Alcantara accents.</p>

<p>The worth of any vehicle is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/used-car-prices-soar-pandemic/">established by the open market</a>, which is made up of individuals like you and me. Whenever you hear of a car fetching some ludicrous price at an auction, keep in mind there was someone with the financial means to pay that much for it. That doesn’t mean it was a wise move, but it does make others look at other examples differently. In other words, we’re expecting this sale will have a positive effect on the value of other CTS-V models on the market, particularly wagons.</p>

<p>We don’t expect the new owner of this Cadillac will be wanting to make any dramatic modifications, but these wagons have a solid reputation for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-wagon-hits-200-mph/">handling mods like a champ</a>. However, the factory supercharged 6.2-liter V8 is enough for most, considering it belts out 556-horsepower and 551 lb.-ft. of torque.</p>
<p>Expect to see the value of clean Cadillac CTS-V models to appreciate well over time, especially those with a manual transmission.</p>
