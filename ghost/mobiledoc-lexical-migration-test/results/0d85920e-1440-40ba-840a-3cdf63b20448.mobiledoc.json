Called “Holiday Ride” it’s got a little bit of everything, including a barn find 1966 Chevy Impala and a lot of heart. Not since Ram released its Super Bowl commercial titled “Farmer” back in 2013 have I been so touched by a car commercial. Seriously, it’s that good."

Also occupying the barn is a dusty ’66 Impala he obviously cherishes but hasn’t been running in years."

Just like this Chevy holiday commercial illustrates, the cars are even more beloved because of the memories they contain and the people who have shared those with us. Sure, a car is just sheet metal, maybe a cast iron block, some chrome trim, etc. but it transcends that in our minds and most importantly in our hearts."
