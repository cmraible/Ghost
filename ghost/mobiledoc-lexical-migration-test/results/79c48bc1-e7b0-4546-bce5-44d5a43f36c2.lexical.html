<hr>
<p>Back in the 1960s and 1970s, Interceptors were built with a variety of Chrysler V8 engines. <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/1504-phx/1970-jensen-interceptor-hemi-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This restomod</a> kicks things up a notch and a half with a modern 6.1 liter Hemi. As a result, this 1970 Jensen Interceptor has been named the "Hemiceptor."</p>

<p>That V8 isn't just a stock motor pulled from a low-mileage wreck, although, in stock form, it would be more than enough to make <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/1504-phx/1970-jensen-interceptor-hemi-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Interceptor</a> brutally fast. Instead, it's received a few tweaks to increase power.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/1504-phx/1970-jensen-interceptor-hemi-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The engine</a> was rebuilt by Bradford Balance and Machine of Kalispell, Montana. It was treated to Wiseco forged pistons, a full complement of ARP hardware, and a mild overbore.</p>

<p>Just as much attention was paid to the brakes and suspension. Up front, you'll find an Art Morrison suspension, with a custom-designed IRS out back. There's beefy Wilwood calipers at all four corners, and the car rides on 17" Enkei five-spokes, painted in a gunmetal hue that <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/1504-phx/1970-jensen-interceptor-hemi-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">complements the body color</a>.</p>
