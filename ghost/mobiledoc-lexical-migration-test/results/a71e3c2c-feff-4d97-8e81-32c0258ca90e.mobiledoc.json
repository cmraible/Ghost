          "As the Bloomberg article points out, it’s hard to get a fix on how much most Iso Grifos have been selling for recently since the vast majority are private transactions, not public auctions. However, we do have some auction examples to provide somewhat of a measure. A 1963 Iso Grifo A3/L prototype was auctioned by Gooding & Co. in 2018 for $1.76 million. Given the rarity of the car since it wasn’t a production model, that amount is on the high end, as demonstrated by the $362,500 a 1968 Iso Grifo Series I snagged when it crossed the block with the help of RM Sotheby’s. That’s more on par with current market analysis of the value of these cars, although that has been on the rise. But we’re not seeing any evidence the Iso Grifo has taken off during the COVID-19 lockdowns, so we’re chalking that up to Bloomberg editors wanting a click-generating headline as well as others wanting to pump up interest in the cars, which probably worked."
