<p>Pickup trucks are just about the most versatile vehicles out there, capable of hauling hefty cargo, towing trailers, and often venturing from the beaten path. However, if you’re after a particularly hardy classic pickup that’ll climb every obstacle you put in front of it, this Chevrolet K20 restomod in our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167743/1974-chevrolet-1-2-ton-pickup">classifieds</a> might be what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>What a sinister looking truck! Finished in a stealthy matt black paint scheme, this 1974 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/">Chevy</a> has gone from workhorse to monster truck in a transformation completed by Straight Line Customs of Minnesota. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/K20">K20’s</a> distinctive design has been preserved with the chunky architecture untouched, however, huge roll bars add to its rugged looks.</p>

<p>The cabin is totally custom with a modern center console hosting a touchscreen infotainment display. A chrome steering wheel and matching shifter is complimented by a modified instrument cluster. The headline act of the interior is undoubtedly the huge man-eating bucket seats – designed to hold their occupants firmly in place.</p>

<p>The most obvious modification to this truck is its greatly increased ride hight. 40-inch Nitto tires and extensive suspension upgrades give the K20 plenty of ground clearance, and serves to add to its intimidating appearance.</p>
<p>Worried about climbing up and into this towering truck each time? Fear not, as power retractable running boards have been fitted to help.</p>
<p>Under the hood is a 350 Ci V8 motor that promises plenty of power and torque with the description stating that its acceleration will ‘push you back in your seat’. All-wheel drive, combined with the aforementioned Nitto tires, should make short work of rough terrain.</p>
<p>This is not a subtle truck, in fact the description plainly states ‘WARNING: If you don't like attention, please stay away from this truck!’ However, if you’re looking to make a big statement with a 4x4 that can do almost anything, this black beauty has your name on it.</p>
