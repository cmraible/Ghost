For example, it has retained the factory-original 400 Ram Air III V8, four-speed manual transmission, plus an upgraded Hurst shifter. Considering Pontiac only made 1,769 Trans Ams with the Ram Air III and manual transmission for 1970, this was a pretty rare bird even when new. Then consider how many of those haven’t survived or no longer retain their original powertrain and that number shrinks considerably."

The Medium Bright Blue interior is also a model of perfection. A rotisserie restoration ensured no part of the car was left untouched, elevating it to a show-quality vehicle you can display with extreme pride. It also helps that since the restoration, only 789 miles have been put on the muscle car."

An upgraded sound system and air conditioning have both been discretely added for increased comfort."
