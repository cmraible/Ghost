<p>“Gov Cuomo just blamed my uncle for dying of COVID in a nursing home and blamed my family for not being tough enough to deal with it.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1361418899791568898">New York State Assemblyman Ron T. Kim</a></p>

<p>A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769034">study</a> released in July found that school closures in the U.S. were linked to a 62 percent decline in COVID cases.</p>

<p>Republicans have been pushing back against renewable energy, arguing that it is unreliable. But a severe winter storm in Texas has left millions <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/16/968230163/millions-without-power-in-texas-northern-mexico-as-blackouts-and-bitter-cold-con">without power</a> as temperatures dip into single digits. The blackouts are mainly brought on by a shortage of natural gas due to a drop in pressure and frozen instruments at fossil fuel and nuclear facilities, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/frozen-wind-farms-were-just-a-small-piece-of-texas-s-power-woes">according to</a> the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).</p>
<p>The fact that Texas <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/explainer/article/texas-electric-deregulation-ERCOT-TCAP-7971360.php">deregulated</a> its power grid in the 1990s could also be part of the problem. The state’s independence from the rest of the country’s power grid has its <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2021/02/15/391519/why-does-texas-have-its-own-power-grid/">roots</a> in Texas’ desire to remain outside the jurisdiction of federal regulators. But electricity market incentives are currently structured in such a way that Texas’ power companies <a href="https://www.power-grid.com/blogs/has-privatization-failed-texas-utility-customers/#gref">receive more money</a> if they don’t weatherize all their plants and shut down some of them during cold weather.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>Over the summer, Texas Republicans used blackouts in California during a heatwave <a href="https://twitter.com/blkahn/status/1361682089310052354?s=21">to attack</a> green energy sources.</p>
<p>Senator Ted Cruz, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1296134869320380419?s=20">tweeted</a>, “California is now unable to perform even basic functions of civilization, like having reliable electricity. Biden/Harris/AOC want to make CA’s failed energy policy the standard nationwide. Hope you don’t like air conditioning!”</p>
<p>So far, the only thing Cruz has tweeted about the Texas blackouts is “<a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1361682246978199553">Don’t risk the ice</a>.”</p>

<p><strong>• LAWMAKERS PUSH TO REVERSE NURSING HOME IMMUNITY: </strong>In the wake of revelations that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cuomo-and-the-lincoln-project-are/">covered up the COVID death toll</a> in nursing homes, lawmakers are <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-gave-nursing-homes-sweeping-pandemic-immunity-now-some-lawmakers-want-roll-it-back">pushing to reverse</a> the liability shield his administration secured for those facilities (and their executives) before filling them with COVID patients.</p>
<p><strong>• SEEKING CLARITY ON BIDEN YEMEN POLICY</strong>: Earlier this month, President Biden signed an executive order ending U.S. support for “offensive operations” carried out by Saudi Arabia in its genocidal war in Yemen. However, the head of U.S. Central Command has since <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/538526-bidens-move-on-yemen-sparks-new-questions">said</a> that the country would still provide intelligence and support for “defensive operations.” Now all eyes are on arms sales from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. The situation on the ground in Yemen has been deemed the <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/news/after-years-conflict-yemen-remains-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis-unfpa-2021#:~:text=2021%20appeal%20shows-,After%20years%20of%20conflict%2C%20Yemen%20remains%20the%20world's%20worst%20humanitarian,a%20UNFPA%202021%20appeal%20shows&text=UNITED%20NATIONS%2C%20New%20York%20%E2%80%93%20A,in%20humanitarian%20emergencies%20are%20greatest.">world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>• DAVID PERDUE FILES TO RUN AGAINST RAPHAEL WARNOCK AGAIN. </strong>With Congress in recess this week and the Democrats’ COVID relief bill in limbo, former Georgia Senator David Perdue, who lost his recent reelection bid to Democrat Jon Ossoff, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/15/us/politics/perdue-warnock-2022.html">filed</a> paperwork to run against the state’s other new Democratic senator, Raphael Warnock, in 2022. Warnock won his race promising $2,000 checks, but Democrats have since scaled that promise back to $1,400. Meanwhile, Kelly Loeffler, Warnock’s former opponent, has also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/02/15/david-perdue-files-for-potential-2022-senate-run-against-raphael-warnock/?sh=4eee6d7c5023">considered running again</a>.</p>
<p><strong>• LAPD’S RACIST VALENTINE’S CARDS: </strong>The Los Angeles Police Department is <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/lapd-investigating-report-of-george-floyd-photo-with-caption-you-take-my-breath-away-circulating-among-officers/">investigating</a> claims that officers were circulating George Floyd Valentine’s Day cards with the caption, “You take my breath away.” The investigation was launched after an officer reported the offensive valentines. LAPD Chief Michel Moore has pledged that if officers circulated the cards, they will feel his “wrath.”</p>
<p><strong>• CONGRESS PLANS COMMISSION ON CAPITOL ATTACK: </strong>Following the Senate’s witness-free trial and acquittal of former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the attack on the Capitol last month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that Congress will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/16/first-thing-congress-plans-commission-capitol-attack-nancy-pelosi?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1613473997">convene</a> a commission to look into the attack.
