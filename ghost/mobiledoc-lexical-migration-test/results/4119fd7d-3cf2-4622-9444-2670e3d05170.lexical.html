<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/dg/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS8">With the Corvette</a> being around for almost a decade, the model had already paved a name for itself as a highly desired sports car. With stunning good looks and plenty of power on tap from the factory, <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/dg/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS8">the '62 Corvette</a> was a highly desired first-generation model. This fine example has plenty more to offer than your regular factory model. A beauty to behold, this fully restored <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/dg/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS8">1962 Chevrolet Corvette</a> convertible is also beastly with its modern powerplant and state-of-the-art chassis.</p>

<p>Sprayed in an award-winning brilliant Salsa Red, <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/dg/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS8">this C1</a> roadster is nothing less than bold perfection. One of the best features on this classic is the ZR1-style hood complete with a glass insert that allows everyone to peek at the small-block without lifting the hood. Even better, an under-dash switch hydraulically raises and lowers the hood without leaving the driver's seat, a feature not even the new Corvettes possess. A set of 17-inch wheels on all four corners are the perfect finishing touch to the exterior. The red matching interior is fitted with genuine Italian-grade leather bucket seats. This beauty also comes with a removable hardtop. With only 100 miles clocked since its restoration, this gem is guaranteed to bring home first-place awards at any car show. </p>
<p>Under the hood sits a fuel-injected Chevy LS3 V8 engine by Lingenfelter Performance Engineering backed by an electronic 4-speed transmission. Spent gases flow through a Magnaflow dual exhaust system. Sitting atop a top-of-the-line Art Morrison chassis, <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/dg/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS8">this '62 Vette</a> features a Ford-9-inch rear end and a rear triangulated four-link suspension and coilovers. Four-wheel disc brakes easily bring all that power to a halt.</p>
