Both of these power houses are based on the LS platform which means they crank out a ton of power and make sliding around a drift track super easy. Oddly enough, the Camaro underway is the 240 SX at just 2600 pounds compared to the 240s 3080. At the end of the day, the 240SX ended up just barely beating out the Camaro the second and first time, likely due to its increased weight which usually transfers to better control at higher speeds. When all of a sudden, the drifters got to do what they do best, tandem donuts. As most commenters point out, probably the most impressive part of the entire video is win Pierre, the driver in the Camaro, pulls off an absolutely wild reverse entry to the tandem donuts and finishes off by drifting into the sunset.",
