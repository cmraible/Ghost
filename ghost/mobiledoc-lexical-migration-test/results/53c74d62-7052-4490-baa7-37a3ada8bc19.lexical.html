<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1965-shelby-gt350r-breaks-mustang-auction-record/">1965 Shelby GT350R</a> wasn't the only battle-tested American <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/racing/">racecar </a>to cross the auction block at Mecum's weeklong Indy 2020 auction event. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1949-indy-500-winner/">1947 Deidt-Offenhauser</a> that won the 1949 Indy 500 was also up for grabs last week, and despite hitting a high bid of $4 million, this incredible racecar failed to sell. Since a pre-auction estimate wasn't given, so it's hard to even guess what kind of price the consignor was looking for, but it's obvious this car is practically priceless.</p>
<p>Watch this historic racecar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14623&v=jaU7k3hwehU">cross the auction block</a> for yourself:</p>

<p>While just about all vintage racecars would make a great addition to any car collection, owning a prestigious piece of Indianapolis 500 history is a rare opportunity. And Bill Holland's no. 7 Blue Crown Spark Plug Special is definitely that.</p>
<p>With Holland behind the wheel, this 1947 Deidt-Offenhauser racecar placed second at the 1947 Indy 500, which was his rookie racing season. His success at the track continued with second-place finishes in 1948 and 1950, and he won the race in 1949. In that race, he led 149 of the 200 total laps, and with this level of success, Mecum says that the Blue Crown enjoyed "the most successful runs in the history of motorsports." Holland's trip down victory lane was captured in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNHV6c6-_I">video</a>.</p>

<p>Despite being more than 70 years old, this car shows incredibly well with its vibrant blue paint, bright red wheels and a tan interior. On looks alone, this racer is ready to win awards, but the listing also says that the Deidt chassis and it 270 cubic-inch Offenhauser "Offy" inline-four engine are still in running condition making the front-wheel drive racecar perfect for any concours d'elegance or vintage car race.</p>
