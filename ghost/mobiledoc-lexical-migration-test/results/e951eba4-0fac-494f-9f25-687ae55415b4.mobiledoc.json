          "The Baja Bronco was built in conjunction with Ford and Off-Road Motorsports Hall of Famer and Baja racer Bill Stroppe to celebrate Stroppe's wins in the Baja 500 and Baja 1000 races. These vehicles rolled off the assembly line wearing a unique paint job consisting of Poppy Red and Wimbledon White with a blue roof and a black hood, and they were then shipped off to Stroppe's shop in California where other modifications were made. An interesting side note about the Baja Bronco is that Stroppe's modifications included an optional automatic transmission, which was the only way you could get a pre-1973 Ford Bronco with an automatic."

          "As far as this 1970 Ford Bronco is concerned, it is an impressive tribute to the rare Baja Bronco, and its overall quality shows that the builder spared no expense. The attention to detail is astounding, and with the exception of the model year, this thing is a perfect replica of Stroppe's creation. The paint show incredibly well thanks to a recent restoration and the Bronco's life spent in California and Arizona, and everything from the engine compartment to the undercarriage is show ready. Under the hood is a 302 CID V8 paired to a three-speed manual transmission, and power is laid down through stylish 15-inch polished alloy wheels wrapped in 33x12.5 Dick Cepek tires. This build even includes authentic \"Baja by Stroppe\" fender badges!"
