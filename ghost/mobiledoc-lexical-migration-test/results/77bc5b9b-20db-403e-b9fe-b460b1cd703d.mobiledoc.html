<p>All you have to do is just look over the exterior and interior of this car to understand why 1955 and 1956 Ford Fairlanes are so intensely desired. It has nice use of chrome, two-tone paint, swooping lines, tasteful fins, and those iconic rocket-style taillights. This one rolls on the stately factory wheels with period-correct wide whitewall tires, adding the luscious feel of the exterior.</p>
<p>And then of course there’s that plexiglass section at the front of the roof. A mere 1,999 buyers elected to add this optional feature, so it’s a rare thing to see. When you sit in this car, it feels so much more open, yet there’s protection from the elements at the same time. Imagine driving through a scenic canyon when the leaves are changing in the fall, staring up at the array of colors through this roof. It’s a breathtaking feature you can cover up using a custom-made shade, which is a huge plus on sunny days.</p>
<p>There’s also an elegance about the two-tone interior. Just like the body, most lines are simple, leaving the space feeling relaxing and sophisticated. You get the charm of factory controls in the dash, while the backseat has a fold-down armrest. This is a machine of fine elegance, something you use to cruise through places leisurely.</p>
<p>Don’t think this Crown Victoria Skyline is boring to drive, because the 3-speed manual transmission and 272ci V8 really add to the fun. This car also comes with Vintage Air air conditioning and has gone through a 12-volt conversion with an alternator installed.</p>
