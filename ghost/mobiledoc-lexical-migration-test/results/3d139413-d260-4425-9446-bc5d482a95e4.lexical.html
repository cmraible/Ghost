<p>No company is better at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-289-fia-cobra/">committing to an idea</a> and sticking with it than <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/red-roadster-1960-porsche-356b/">Porsche</a>. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorious-dream-car-picks-90s-edition/">aircooled 911</a> isn't the only example, although it's a great one.</p>
<p>The same car that bowed in 1964 would go on to form the basis of cars like the legendary 959 supercar, while the 993 Turbo would maintain the classic 911's reputation deep into the 1990s.</p>

<p>The Porsche 924 may not get much respect, but Porsche stuck with the concept and we ended up getting the excellent 944, as well as the tremendous 944 Turbo (951).</p>
<p>The 968 would be the final evolution of the basic 924 architecture, and in Cabriolet form as seen here, it forms a visual "missing link" between the 944 that preceded it and the Boxster that came immediately after. </p>

<p>We found <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/216949/1992-porsche-968-cabriolet">this 1992 Porsche 968 Cabriolet</a> right here on Motorious. The ad states that it's one of just over 2,000 968 Cabriolets sold here between 1992 and 1995.</p>
<p>The 968 is powered by a massive 3.0 liter inline four cylinder engine. That engine, developed from the 2.5 liter four cylinder that debuted in the 944 back in 1982, now sported dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder.</p>

<p>The updated engine also benefitted from VarioCam, Porsche's name for variable valve timing. The end result was a respectable 237 horsepower, a healthy bump of nearly 100 from what you'd find in an early 944.</p>
<p>The 968 also benefitted from a smooth-shifting six speed manual, or Tiptonic, if you're into that sort of thing. Thankfully, the original owner of this 968 made the right choice.</p>
<p>You can find this rare Porsche offered for sale right here on Motorious by <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/216949/1992-porsche-968-cabriolet">Gaudin Porsche</a> of Las Vegas, Nevada. With just over 6,000 miles on the odometer, this is as close to a new 968 as you'll ever get.</p>
