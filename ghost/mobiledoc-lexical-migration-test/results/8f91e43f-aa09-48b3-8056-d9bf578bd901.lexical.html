<hr>
<p>While we certainly love the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/850-hp-all-motor-1970-chevelle/">rumble of an American V8</a> or the otherworldly resonation of an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corruptt-mustang-has-a-ferrari-heart/">exotic like a Ferrari</a>, it’s always nice to see a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/robert-downey-bmw/">highly-modified BMW</a>. This is especially true of the Bimmers from back when the company was making legendary <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thief-takes-porsche-911-gts-on-a-shockingly-short-getaway-drive/">driver’s cars</a>, because the only thing that can make something like that better is a big heaping serving of oversteer. That’s what this BMW 635 CSi pushing 1,200-horsepower is all about and it’s great fun.</p>
<p>You might not expect <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-packs-insane-9-9-liter-hemi-v8/">a bonkers car like this out of Western Europe</a>. Too often, it seems people there look down their noses at Americans performing massive burnouts in cars which corner like a slob. The fact that in the accompanying vehicle this BMW is of the same ilk just warms our hearts. Also, at one point we see a Ram pickup truck in the background, in Europe of all places. Clutch the pearls!</p>
<p>If you don’t know much about the BMW E24, the 635 CSi has a 3.4-liter inline-six engine which pushes a decent 218-hp. That engine is pretty legendary and so there are a lot of aftermarket modifications available for it. However, instead of just going for a light upgrade, the owner of this Bimmer added a massive turbocharger and no doubt swapped out most of the internals to achieve 1,200-hp.</p>
<p>In the video of this car, at one point the driver does a long, smoky burnout that you’d expect from a muscle car, not a BMW. You can tell the guy is having to work to keep the car from going even kind of straight and it’s so fun to watch.</p>
<p>Amazingly, people in this European town don’t seem to mind much at all. In fact, there are a fair amount of onlookers snapping photos, taking video, and laughing at this wonderful sight. There might not be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-packs-insane-9-9-liter-hemi-v8/">as much of a difference</a> between enthusiasts in Europe and enthusiasts in North America after all.</p>
