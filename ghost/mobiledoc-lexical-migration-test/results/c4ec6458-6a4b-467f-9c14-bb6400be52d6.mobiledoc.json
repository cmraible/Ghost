          "On January 29 the lives of 9 people were cut short, leaving countless loved ones mourning, all thanks to one man driving a Dodge Challenger recklessly. According to a local report, 59-year-old Gary Dean Robinson was behind the wheel of the Mopar muscle car when he ran a red light. Police say speed was a factor in the crash. It’s believed the muscle car was traveling over 100 mph as it entered the intersection."

Seven people who were riding in a Toyota Sienna were killed, including four children aged 5, 10, 13, and 15. We can only imagine the grief of their loved ones, especially given the senselessness of their deaths."

The list stretches back to 1998 and includes six felonies such as battery on a police officer with substantial bodily harm and assault with a deadly weapon. The man received citations for speeding in the past."
