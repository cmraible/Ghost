The streaming set-top box &#8212; a &#8220;hobby&#8221; of the company for several years &#8212; has been the subject of constant rumors the past few months, with many analysts and insiders claiming a newer, better version would arrive this year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/apple-logo-300x180.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-38150\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/apple-logo-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"apple-logo-300x180\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" /></a>Not so fast, says <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/Apple-s-TV-Push-Stalls-as-Partners-Hesitate\"><em>The Information</em></a>.</p>\n<p>According to that site, we likely won&#8217;t get a new Apple TV until 2015. Why? A couple factors seem to be at play; for starters, the looming merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, as well as the fact that cable companies in general aren&#8217;t crazy about change. One only has to look at the way Apple dramatically changed the landscape of the music industry with iTunes to see why cable companies might be spooked.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say the deals won&#8217;t get done. But it&#8217;s going to take some time &#8212; probably more than Apple had anticipated &#8212; and so it makes sense that we probably wouldn&#8217;t get a shiny new Apple TV until they&#8217;re in place.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Apple does with this new box in terms of content. Apple working to secure agreements with cable providers isn&#8217;t necessarily a good sign; it could mean that the device will be more of a cable IPTV box than a way to deliver an a la carte TV service. But why would cable companies be hesitant to get on board if Apple simply wanted to own the front-end UI? That could lead one to believe that Apple is after a bit more control, and wants to shake things up a bit more than the cable companies are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Will we see a new Apple TV this year, or is 2015 the safer bet? Leave a comment below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
