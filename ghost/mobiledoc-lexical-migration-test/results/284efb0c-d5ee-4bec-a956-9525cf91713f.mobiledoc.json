Even at a standstill, the Diablo looks like it's driving 200 mph with its wedge design and massive rear spoiler, and tucked just behind the seats  is a 5.7-liter V12 with a five-speed manual transmission to ensure this car is as fun to drive as it to look at."

Ask children of the '90s what car posters they had on their walls, and the Lamborghini Diablo is likely to be one of the more popular answers. Even 30 years after its creation, the Diablo is still a stunning supercar, and this rarely used example is even more impressive. The best part about this Diablo are Lamborghini's iconic five-hole wheels, while the inside is like a luxurious racecar with quilted leather door panels and black leather seats with yellow piping."
