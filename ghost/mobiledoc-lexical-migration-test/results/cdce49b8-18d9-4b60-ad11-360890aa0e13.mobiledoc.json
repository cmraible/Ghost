They’re usually perplexed that the vehicle which they see in advertisements splashing through mountain creeks or that they saw in some viral video taking on Widow Maker (with heavy editing, of course) quickly leaves them stranded once they depart from highly groomed dirt roads."

A lot of times these people hop a plane to southern Utah, grab a rental crossover they think is an off-roader, and head out to some exotic locations in the desert they saw on Instagram. In other words, they do little planning and have little to no knowledge of the local terrain."

Also, he might be realizing his Tesla can’t be superior to every other vehicle out there. Hopefully he spreads the message to the rest of the club since that would be nice."

Also, to be fair, a stock FJ Cruiser is not a great off-roader, despite what some people try to claim. This one has at least some bolt-on mods, but I don’t really know what all they’ve done to it. Anyway, I’m really not surprised it wasn’t successful. What’s worse is the FJ Cruiser driver didn’t realize he could have used his winch and nearby trees to pull himself out, and that’s where experience comes into play when off-roading."

          "We all make stupid mistakes on trails but hopefully we learn from them. The main lesson here is that a heavy all-electric crossover will sink in deep snow like a rock. Also, snow that’s nice and hard in the early morning will soften as the sun comes out and the ambient temperature increases, making it more likely you will get stuck. But mainly you should remember Teslas don’t belong on trails."
