Any time a rare and genuine barn find is uncovered it’s a big deal, but for the last while these types of events have been increasingly rare."

          "-themed ride won’t pan out, at least not this time. This particular Caddie ambulance is going to be restored and displayed permanently at the Virginia Fire Museum. Photos of it after a good washing shows the paint is in surprisingly good condition, although it’s going to need some work. Whatever was in that barn dust must’ve prevented rust since this old Cadillac doesn’t look like Swiss cheese, even on the rocker panels."

As you can somewhat see in the photos, the thing was literally coming down around the classic car, so it’s good they got it out of there before any damage was done. However, the crew which yanked the ambulance out had to work for a few hours to free it, so don’t let anyone telling you barn find hunting is easy work."

But it looks to be miraculously complete with the trim and even the gumball lights intact. There are zero shots of the interior, but we wonder if it isn’t in similarly good condition. If so, expect this ride to be restored in short order. The museum says it will post on its Facebook page about the progress, if you’re interested."
