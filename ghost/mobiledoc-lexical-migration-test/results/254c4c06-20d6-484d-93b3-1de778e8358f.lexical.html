</div> Here is one of the things that’s keeping me sane right now. It’s a little dock unit which plugs into my car’s cigarette lighter (pretty much unused until now), providing a useful dock and charger for an iPod on the move. The cassette adaptor plugs into the unit, meaning that it’s pulling its signal from the digital output on the base of the iPod rather than the headphone socket at the top, leading to better sound.<p></p>
<p>I’m spending a lot of time on the roads between London, Suffolk and Norfolk right now, and it’s lovely to escape the tyranny of the radio programmers.</p>
<p>I also like the unexpected appearance of my hand (complete with wedding ring) in this pic.</p>

<p>It’s been a long day.</p>
