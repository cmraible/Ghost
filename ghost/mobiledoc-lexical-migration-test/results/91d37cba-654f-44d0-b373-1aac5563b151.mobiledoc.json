The 1957 Bel Air saw Chevrolet add tail fins with beautiful side trim that was much larger than the previous 2 years and the gold \"Chevrolet\" script trim and gold \"V\" hood trim was carried through to the '57 model.  This particular '57 Bel Air Convertible comes to us out of a very large collection in Texas, where the previous owner clearly took excellent care of the car."

          "Top-down, two-seat motoring is supposed to be the ultimate expression personal luxury, and this 1957 Ford Thunderbird does that perfectly. With under 250 miles on it since a complete restoration, this has everything you want from a beautiful color combo to the correct D-code V8 providing plenty of cruising power. A first-generation T-bird rendered in Colonial White has the appeal of driving around fine China.  The graceful color just has a way of rendering the lines that give this vintage convertible a timeless elegance."
