They are wired controllers that connect via USB and the L/R and ZL/ZR buttons can be reassigned. The only downside that we can see here is the triggers aren&#8217;t analogue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What do you think about these new controllers? Will you be picking them up if they come to the west (or import them)? Let us know in the Comments section below.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to like our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/switchaboo\">Facebook Page</a> in order to get updated with every article we post, along with more Nintendo content.
