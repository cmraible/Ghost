<p>Throughout the world’s largest historic racing weekend, front and centre is the AMHR Festival Series race. Created as a showcase for Aston Martin Racing’s back-catalogue of GT racers, this high-class grid includes everything from the iconic Le Mans-winning GT1 DRB9 (first raced in 2005) to the equally successful first generation V8 Vantage GTE; a machine that rounds-out its top-flight competition career during this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours. <br><br>Fans of the DBRS9, Vantage GT2, V12 Vantage GT3 and pre-2018 Vantage GT4 won’t be disappointed, as these are also eligible to race, alongside ‘specials’ – such as the Aston Martin Vulcan – and selected Aston Martin competition cars that pre-date the AMR era, courtesy of a varied invitation class. <br><br>Quite frankly, this promises to be the best-looking race of the Silverstone Classic weekend. Not to mention that glorious noise…</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Aston+Martin">Aston Martin</a>’s involvement in the race weekend extends well beyond Sunday’s Festival Series race, however. As an official automotive partner of both Masters Historic Racing and the Silverstone Classic meeting itself, a further highlight of the event is set to be the Aston Martin Masters Endurance Legends races. <br><br>Featuring an array of LMP1 and LMP2 sports prototypes, presenting the likes of Audi’s R8, various V12 diesel-engined Peugeots and the wailing Gulf-livered Lola-Aston Martin DBR1-2, the AMMEL race will start at dusk and run into the darkness – an evocative taste of true endurance racing.</p>

<p><br>Providing safety with style, further limelight is sure to be stolen by a pair of specially prepared <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Aston+Martin+Vantage">Aston Martin Vantage</a> Safety Cars. These beasts will be on-duty throughout the race weekend as part of Aston Martin’s official automotive partnership with Silverstone Classic. <br><br>You can buy tickets for the upcoming 2019 Silverstone Classic event through the official website <a href="https://www.silverstoneclassic.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3L7m1pTX4gIVCpztCh0QBQPEEAAYASAAEgIX6vD_BwE">here</a>.</p>
