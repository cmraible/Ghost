That’s what happened when 30-year-old Eduardo Munoz reportedly led Franklin County deputies on a pursuit in southeastern Washington state recently. Ultimately, he allegedly led them right to a stash of stolen cars, drug paraphernalia, and stolen artifacts of all things."

The driver, Munoz, didn’t pull over when deputies activated their lights, leading them on a chase before stopping at a nearby house north of Pasco. The driver jumped out of the car and ran into the house."
