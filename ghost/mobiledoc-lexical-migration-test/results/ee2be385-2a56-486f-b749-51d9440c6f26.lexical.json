The man has access to places the rest of us don’t even know exist, so it’s great when he brings us along for some of those adventures. This time around the man is in San Diego where he introduces viewers to a man with an incredibly cluttered shop just filled with amazing cars and memorabilia from back in the day.",

Instead, he came up with the idea of cubing it because of a James Bond movie of all things, probably not realizing just how valuable it would’ve been fully restored today. Before cubing the Shelby, he removed and sold the serial number as well as other usable parts. He was going to make a table out of the car, but like a lot of things in his shop, it’s just sat and rusted. Seeing this is definitely painful for a lot of people, but it’s also fascinating.",
