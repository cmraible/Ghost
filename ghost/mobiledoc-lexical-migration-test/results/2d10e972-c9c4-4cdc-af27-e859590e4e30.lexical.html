It’s a big money do, and some exhibitors there spend some serious money to bring along celebrities. And other PR people think <a href="http://revstan.vox.com/library/post/over-cannes-out.html">it’s a good idea to hire Linda Barker</a>…</p>
<div>> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">There was no english breakfast served on a spoon this year instead down-on-its-luck Bradford rolled out Linda Barker of crap furniture ad and TV makeover fame to promote the city. God knows who thought that was an effective use of however much money she cost.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"> > </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">I did make a bit of a tit of myself by only recognising her enough to think she must be a PR I’d met last year. “Oh I thought I recognised your face” is probably not the best line to use when introduced to a ‘celebrity’. </span>

    <p>Money well spent by Bradford’s PRs, then.</p>
