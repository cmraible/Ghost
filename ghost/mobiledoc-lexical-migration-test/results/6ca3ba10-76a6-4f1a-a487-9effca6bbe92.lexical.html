<p>Happy June! It‚Äôs a new month and we have more good news.</p>
<p>Minnesota has passed an avalanche of progressive legislation, and Washington is proving that wealth taxes work. Plus, Illinois Democrats pass a budget, New York City gets its first pizza shop worker‚Äôs union, the National Labor Relations Board sets a precedent against non-compete clauses, and more.</p>
<h3 id="minnesota-progressives-are-on-a-roll">Minnesota Progressives Are On A Roll</h3>
<p>In terms of passing laws that make a difference, Minnesota‚Äôs lawmakers have been on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-medicare-for-all-sees-record-support/">roll</a> this year. They‚Äôre proving that progress is possible and demonstrating the effectiveness of a Democratic legislative trifecta (Illinois‚Äô recent budget did the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/illinois-playbook/2023/05/30/illinois-trifectas-progressive-agenda-00099209">same</a>). The legislators‚Äô latest victory? Ending cannabis prohibition.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz <a href="https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/minnesota-recreational-marijuana-bill-governor-tim-walz-signing/">signed</a> a bill to legalize recreational marijuana on Tuesday, joining 22 other states with similar legislation. Growing, possessing, and using marijuana will be legal starting August 1st, but it‚Äôll be another year before dispensaries are licensed. Notably, the bill includes provisions to give communities most harmed by prohibition opportunities in the newly legal industry.</p>
<p>Bans on marijuana are <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform">racist</a> and ineffective, and only exacerbate America‚Äôs mass incarceration crisis ‚Äì‚Äì nationally, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers">half</a> of all drug arrests are for marijuana, and Black people in Minnesota are <a href="https://graphics.aclu.org/marijuana-arrest-report/MN">more</a> than five times likelier than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession. At the signing ceremony, Gov. Walz said the state will begin the expungement process on marijuana charges, which could give thousands of Minnesotans greater access to jobs, housing, education and more.</p>
<p>Legalizing cannabis is only the latest in a <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2023/05/transformational-and-also-bonkers-minnesota-legislature-ends-its-session-of-historic-spending-policy-changes/">historically</a> productive legislative <a href="https://mspmag.com/arts-and-culture/what-the-minnesota-legislature-passed-this-session/">session</a> for progressives: The state became the first in the nation to codify fundamental abortion rights, enabled automatic voter registration for 16- and 17-year-olds, <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2023/05/31/minnesota-free-college-tuition-undocumented-immigrants-eligible">expanded</a> free two- and four-year state and community college to families earning less than $80,000, and committed to carbon-free public utilities by 2040. Lawmakers also ensured people are eligible for driver‚Äôs licenses regardless of citizenship status, provided free meals in schools, enacted two bills for stronger gun control, prohibited workplace discrimination against Black people‚Äôs natural hair, and so much more.</p>
<p>Plus, last week Minnesota <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/05/21/minnesota-legislature-approves-minimum-wage-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers/">passed</a> minimum wage protections for Uber and Lyft drivers and the state is being <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31052023/minnesota-clean-energy-leader/">lauded</a> as the midwest frontrunner for an equitable transition to green energy. True to its name, the North Star State is showing the rest of us the way to the future!</p>
<h3 id="operation-avoid-oil-explosion-begins">Operation Avoid Oil Explosion Begins</h3>
<p>The U.N. is working to avert a potentially disastrous oil explosion and spill by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/safer-yemen-tanker-salvage-oil-environment-51661ccca6b456a7c9d19d44fb19d39c">starting</a> the cleanup process on a 1.1 million-barrel oil tanker abandoned off the coast of Yemen. A major spill in the Red Sea would be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65764775">catastrophic</a>, destroying coral reefs and fishing communities and exposing millions of people to severe pollution. Called an ‚Äúecological time bomb,‚Äù by industry experts, the tanker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/world/middleeast/yemen-oil-tanker-spill.html">contains</a> four times more oil than was leaked during the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>The deteriorating <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65764775">tanker</a>, constructed in 1976, fell to disrepair in 2015 following conflicts from Yemen‚Äôs civil war. The U.N. has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/world/middleeast/yemen-oil-tanker-spill.html">fundraising</a> for the cleanup operation for years, but is still $29 million short and will continue to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/StopRedSeaSpill">fundraise</a>.</p>
<p>The cleanup process began on Tuesday, when the first salvage barge arrived. It‚Äôll take another six weeks before the oil from the tanker is completely transferred to another vessel and disaster is averted, but it‚Äôs encouraging that the process has finally begun.</p>
<h3 id="the-wealth-tax-works-in-washington">The Wealth Tax Works In Washington</h3>
<p>A wealth tax implemented in Washington state just last year has already <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/05/25/washington-collects-nearly-850-million-in-capital-gains/">raised</a> more than $849 million as of this month, more than tripling initial projections.</p>
<p>The tax, which <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/was-new-capital-gains-tax-brings-in-849-million-so-far-much-more-than-expected/">passed</a> in 2021 and took effect in the 2023 fiscal year, collects seven percent on the sale or exchange of long-term assets above $250,000. It got major <a href="https://www.freedomfoundation.com/budget-taxes/statement-by-freedom-foundation-ceo-regarding-the-washington-supreme-courts-decision-to-stay-unconstitutional-ruling-on-capital-gains-tax/">pushback</a> from a group funded by billionaires like Charles Koch and the DeVos family (<a href="http://whatisthefreedomfoundation.org/about.html">oops</a>), but was <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/subscribe/signup-offers/?pw=redirect&subsource=paywall&return=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wa-supreme-court-upholds-capital-gains-tax/">upheld</a> by the state‚Äôs Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The millions raised from the tax will go into school districts and childcare programs, financing much-needed construction and renovations and funding early childhood education programming. Seven other states have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wealth-tax-in-8-states-california-new-york-connecticut-washington-illinois/">proposed</a> wealth taxes, and Washington‚Äôs success shows that such taxes have the potential to facilitate major change and might become a powerful tool for pushing those bills through.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time we start rewarding work instead of wealth, and build an economy that works for everyone,‚Äù <a href="https://senatedemocrats.wa.gov/frame/2023/03/09/wa-state-wealth-tax-proposal-receives-strong-support-in-senate-hearing/">said</a> bill sponsor Democratic State Sen. Noel Frame when the law was signed.</p>

<h3 id="one-labor-lovers-pizza-coming-right-up">One Labor-Lovers Pizza, Coming Right Up</h3>
<p>Workers at Barboncino Pizza in Brooklyn are forming New York City‚Äôs first pizzeria union. They announced last week on <a href="https://twitter.com/barbounited/status/1661514782489423873">Twitter</a> that a supermajority of the restaurant‚Äôs staff has signed on with Workers United.</p>
<p>It all began one particularly trying night in the summer of 2022 (the incident became known as ‚Äúpoop night‚Äù; <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/05/barboncino-restaurant-union-workers-united-bwu-ewoc">read more</a> if you dare). After a callous response from management, workers reached out to the Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC), an organization that helps with the early stages of union campaigns. The pizzeria staff connected with Workers United, filed with the NLRB for a union election, and are now fighting for a living wage, protections against arbitrary terminations, and clarity on disciplinary policies.</p>
<p>Food service workers are nationally underrepresented in organized labor: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t03.htm">According</a> to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.6 percent of food service workers are unionized, compared to 7.7 percent of health care and social assistance workers and 15.2 percent of education workers. That makes the pizzeria‚Äôs move to unionize particularly powerful, and staff ‚Äì‚Äì emphasizing that their real fight is with the whole food-service industry, not Barboncino ‚Äì‚Äì hopes their organizing can inspire a broader movement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBarboncino is the prototypical restaurant,‚Äù Alex Dinndorf, a server, busser, and union organizer at the pizzeria, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/05/barboncino-restaurant-union-workers-united-bwu-ewoc">told</a><em>Jacobin</em>. ‚ÄúIf we can organize, any other nearby restaurant can too, and they‚Äôll do it twice as quickly as we did.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="a-precedent-to-fight-noncompetes">A Precedent To Fight Noncompetes</h3>
<p>National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Lawyer Jennifer Abruzzo sent out a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-jennifer-abruzzo-issues-memo-to-field-offices-with">memo</a> last Tuesday declaring that noncompete clauses violate federal laws protecting workers‚Äô rights to union organizing and collective action.</p>
<p>Noncompete clauses prevent workers from taking jobs with rival companies for a period of time after employment. These clauses, impacting one in five American workers, weaken workers‚Äô bargaining and collective action power in labor negotiations. And while corporations say they help maintain trade secrets and confidential information, these clauses often <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-noncompete-clause-gets-a-closer-look-11626872430?mod=article_inline">apply</a> to workers who don‚Äôt even handle trade secrets in the first place.</p>
<p>In last week‚Äôs <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-california-pensions-could-change-the-world/">You Love To See It,</a> we mentioned that four states have already banned noncompetes: California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and most recently, Minnesota. The Federal Trade Commission <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-a-regulator-steps-up-to-the-plate/">proposed</a> banning noncompete clauses in January, and has estimated that a ban could increase annual employee earnings by almost $300 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/noncompete-clauses-what-they-are-and-what-to-know-before-signing-your-contract-11673025017?mod=article_inline">billion</a>.</p>
<p>The memo isn‚Äôt a law or a binding rule, but it‚Äôs part of a growing trend to address the dangers of noncompetes, and could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/noncompete-clauses-violate-labor-law-nlrb-lawyer-says-459fc081">help</a> local NLRB offices more effectively challenge these clauses to create binding legal precedents going forward.</p>

<p>Systematically <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2021/05/08/991535564/black-americans-and-the-racist-architecture-of-homeownership">racist</a> housing policies, including redlining, predatory lending, and explicitly discriminatory real estate, have kept Black people from accessing homeownership and building generational wealth across the country.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Taking Ownership PDX has raised $1.7 million and helped more than 160 Black homeowners and small business owners with repairs, renovations, and other household tasks. Meanwhile, the PDX Housing Solidarity Project is re-imagining community care through housing mutual-aid actions like paying off credit card debts, providing money for down payments, co-signing leases, and facilitating off-market home sales, which make it easier for Black families to access real estate at lower costs. Randal himself <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/05/18/pdx-housing-solidarity-project-black-home-ownership-portland-oregon/">bought</a> a house through an off-market sale for less than half its market price, from a seller who wanted to redistribute her inherited wealth.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCapitalism and individualism doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs actually going to lead to the demise of human civilization,‚Äù Randal said. ‚ÄúSharing resources, that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre gonna survive and thrive as a species.‚Äù</p>
