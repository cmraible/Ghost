Shifting is handled by a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that twists a rear limited-slip Torsen differential stuffed with 3.73 gears. Sturdy enough to handle the copious amount of power is a composite carbon fiber driveshaft. An independent rear suspension complete with MagneRide helps plant the car to the ground while keeping handling in check."
