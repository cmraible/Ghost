<hr>
<p>We don’t know what the deal is with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/california-c8-corvette-crash/">C8 Corvettes</a>, but for how few there are out there we’ve seen and covered a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-crashes-hard/">disproportionate number of crashes</a> involving them. In all fairness, we’ve observed the same thing with Dodge Chargers and Ford Mustangs, so it’s not a brand-specific thing. But with demand for C8 Corvettes far outstripping supply from Bowling Green, we see why rebuilding one that’s been wrecked is worth the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Check out an unfortunate C8 Corvette crash <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-crashes-final/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>That’s exactly what YouTuber vTuned garage is up to lately, having scooped up a 2022 Chevy Corvette from Copart. Listed as a “run and drive” car, the engine does in fact work just fine. However, the rear suspension is broken, giving the passenger-side wheel that kind of camber the stanced crowd seems to crave.</p>

<p>You’ll also note the rear passenger-side fender is missing as is the rear bumper. There’s damage to other panels panels and rim pieces, a window is missing, and there are some other obvious problems. That said, this C8 Corvette doesn’t look as bad as one might expect.</p>
<p>As for the interior, it’s immaculate. With red seats, the presentation impresses vTuned, a guy who’s rebuilt some pretty nice rides, including a McLaren 720S, so that should tell you something. There are some good reasons why people are literally lining up to buy C8 Corvettes.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind as you watch the video vTuned rebuilds cars for a living, so he knows what he’s doing and doesn’t seem the least bit intimidated by the process. For your average person this would be a job to hire out to a professional like him, unless you have a lot of time to spend learning all kinds of new skills.</p>
