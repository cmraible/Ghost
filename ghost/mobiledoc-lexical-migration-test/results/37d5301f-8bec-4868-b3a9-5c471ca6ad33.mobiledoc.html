<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <em>The Daily Poster</em> is adjusting our monthly and annual subscription price to help us expand our newsroom in 2021. We don’t want to price anyone out — so we wanted to give you a heads up:</p>
<p><strong>If you’ve been thinking about subscribing and want to lock in at the current LOWER rates, you should <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to subscribe before the adjustment happens.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>Also — because it is the holiday season — I should mention that if you want to give a gift subscription to anyone before the rates adjust tomorrow, you can also do that by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gift">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>A reminder: When you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a supporting subscriber, you get access to all of our subscriber-only live events where you get to talk to high-profile guests, and you get our exclusive Midday Poster filled with scoops and news nuggets.</p>
<p>Beyond that, when you become a supporting subscriber, you are helping us hire more reporters to do more hard-hitting accountability journalism. As a grassroots-funded news outlet, we don’t answer to corporate or billionaire owners — but we can only build out a full newsroom with your help. <strong>So please <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a supporting subscriber right now.</strong></p>
<p>Every week, you are seeing concrete evidence that our work is making a big impact (<a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1336708951409233920">see this from yesterday!</a>) — and we can have even more in 2021 if everyone pitches in.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
