That’s exactly what happened a year ago when a 13-year-old boy used a GoPro camera to take a peek at what he thought was a car deep below the surface of a frigid mountain lake in British Columbia. Little did he know he’d be instrumental in solving a 27-year-old mystery."

The boy and his parents called the police, who sent a dive team down to check out the car a few days later. To their shock, there was a body inside."

The mother of two and grandmother of five disappeared as she was driving to her niece’s wedding in Innisfail from Vancouver Island. Her vanishing haunted the family that entire time as they searched endlessly for their loved one."
