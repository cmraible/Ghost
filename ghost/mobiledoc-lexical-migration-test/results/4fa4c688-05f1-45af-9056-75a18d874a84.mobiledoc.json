The blacked-out grille is a telltale sign that his is the water-cooled model making room for the radiator, but other than that, the styling didn't change too much from 1967 through 2013."

That comes in handy especially with this model's camper-style interior that includes a rear bench seat that folds out into a bed.  Best of all, this 1994 Volkswagen Kombi is still in great shape with the odometer showing just under 85,000 kilometers, which is around 52,000 miles."
