The red paint job with gold snowflake wheels show exceptionally well, and there is no sign of damage or wear to the lower body kit. Inside, the saddle tan cloth interior is equally flawless, and this car is equipped with the premium stereo system with the steering wheel controls."

Having been fully serviced and wearing recently replaced tires, this 1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA is ready to hit the road.
