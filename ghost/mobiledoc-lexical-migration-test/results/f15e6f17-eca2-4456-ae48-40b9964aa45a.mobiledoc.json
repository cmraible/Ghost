The iconic body with its beautifully flat front fenders is painted in black with an eggshell finish, and the stance is perfect with 20-inch wheels with a matte finish and wrapped in meaty BFGoodrich T/A K02 tires. The ruggedly good looks include a roof rack, front and rear LED light bars and diamond plating in the cargo bed, while the jerry cans and side-mounted traction skids show that this Defender is ready for action."
