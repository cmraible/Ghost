<p>Hi there,<br></p>
<p>We’ve heard folks say they want to subscribe to <em>The Lever</em>, but the price is a bit too high. So today only, we are offering a special limited-time discount: <strong>$2 per month for the next year</strong>, our lowest price ever. When you become a paying subscriber, you are directly funding journalism that holds politicians accountable - and you get tons of exclusive stuff.</p>

<p>We’re offering this discount because we refuse to price anyone out, especially at a time when we are all being terrorized by a tough economy, a corrupt political system and a radicalized Supreme Court. It feels as though the 20th century itself is being re-litigated and overturned before our very eyes.<br></p>
<p>We’ve been doing our part to fight back: We’ve been exposing the dark money and corruption that corporate media refuses to report on. And our blockbuster stories have made a real impact. But we cannot do it without reader support. We need you on our team. It's go time – join us!</p>

<p><strong>Remember: When you become a full subscriber you get access to additional newsletters, our premium podcast, subscriber-only live events, </strong><em><strong>The Lever</strong></em><strong> ebooks, commenting capabilities, and more.</strong><br></p>
<p>If you do not use this discount, we still thank you for being a reader and we sincerely hope you will continue reading and sharing <em>The Lever</em>’s work that challenges power.<br></p>
<p>Rock the boat,<br></p>
