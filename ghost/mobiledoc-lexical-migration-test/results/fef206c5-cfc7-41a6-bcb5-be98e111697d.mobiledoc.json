The Chevrolet Master (the HB) and Master Deluxe (the HA) are American passenger vehicles that were produced between 1933 and 1942 to replaced the Chevy Eagle. The Chevrolet Master was also one of the more expensive models in the automaker’s range at this time. A top-of-the-line Special Deluxe was launched from 1940 onward."

This is mainly because of the ease of availability when it came to parts, as well as the simplicity of replacing the engine. Many versions survive today, but that does not make this example less valuable or less desirable in any way – especially when you see all of its unique touches. It's currently up for sale through "

The pink, teal, and yellow prismatic stripes are somewhat “Pink Floyd”-esque and are splashed across the front of the rear quarters to the bottom of the front fenders. All in all, this two-door sedan is in great shape and shows no rust. It sits proud on American Racing Torq II chrome wheels at all four corners. The sealed beam headlights illuminate the path ahead, while the bright LED taillights signal your passage to the cars that fall behind."
