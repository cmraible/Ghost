The legendary 1, 2, 3, GT40 finish in 1966 is one of motorsport’s greatest stories, crowned by the fact that exactly 50 years later Ford won its class in the modern GT. The racer has seen much success, but this year’s Le Mans 24 Hour event will be the last factory effort for now. Marking the occasion will be a quartet of historic racing liveries."

Number 67 is finished in an eye-catching red and white scheme that harks back to the A.J. Foyt and Dan Gurney piloted GT40 of 1967 that also won the event. Ford GT 69 honors the GT40 that came second in 1966, and the final car hosts the familiar colors seen on the modern GT that won in 2016."

The aim was to dethrone the Prancing Horse, proving that Ford’s snubbed acquisition of the Italian marque made the blue oval no less capable. Run by the Shelby American team, the GT40’s dominated the prestigious endurance race in 1966, and won again in 1967. 1968 and 1969 were then won by GT40s run by John Wyer Automotive Engineering."
