<p>We all have that one car that got away. For Harold Zimmerman of Bismarck, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/north-dakota-grandfathers-car/">North Dakota</a> it’s a 1968 Plymouth GTX the man bought it brand new off the dealer lot when was just 16 years old. It was something he cherished, but life has a way of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/overgrown-secret-garden-of-classic-cars/">throwing curve balls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Find out how a Florida woman tracked down her stolen car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-woman-stolen-car/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>As a man, you put many necessities before your hobbies and a move to Tucson, Arizona in 1969 with his wife meant selling the classic Plymouth, says local news station KFYR-TV. Of course, Harold pined after the vehicle for a long time after.</p>
<p>Now think about that for a moment: this guy bought the Plymouth GTX when it was new and he was 16. It was a 1968 model. Then in 1969 he was married and moving across the country. How many young kids are taking on responsibilities and making sacrifices like that these days? Times sure change.</p>
<p>Back to the story: starting in July 2000 Harold started really thinking about his lost love, the GTX, and wondered where it might be. He had lost track of it after the friend he sold it to sold it to someone else. Using the power of the internet, he started searching for the VIN, something many people have done to track down a long lost automotive flame.</p>
<p>After some time of internet sleuthing, Harold tracked the Mopar down to Montana. However, when he reached out to the current owner, he learned it had been sold and that person didn’t have information about the new owner. So he was back to square one.</p>
<p>Undeterred, he continued digging for information, eventually find a classic car dealer was selling it. After buying the ’68 Plymouth GTX he found in the paperwork that at one time his beloved ride had been owned by Hollywood actor David Arquette.</p>
<p>Now, the plan is to keep the car in the family.</p>
