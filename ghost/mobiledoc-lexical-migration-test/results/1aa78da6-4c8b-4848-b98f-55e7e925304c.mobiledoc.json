While 2020 is certainly a lot different than it was in 2008, one common element is the growing interest in podcasts. It's interesting because podcasts kind of faded in the early 2010s only to pick up in popularity again in 2016, with interest remaining strong (and growing) ever since."

However, now that I have a mixer, many of the app's features aren't as necessary, but I do like the interface so I use it to record all sound coming from my mixer and it works really well. I've configured Audio Hijack to record everything to a WAV file which I then import into Adobe Audition to edit (and subsequently export as a MP3 for uploading). Audio Hijack retails for $60. "

Adding a second camera is an excellent idea, especially if you plan to have guests in the studio – you'll want them to have a dedicated camera for them and with Streamlabs OBS you can configure it separately bringing both views side by side (as shown in the above screenshot with me and Odie).
