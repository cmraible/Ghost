<p>On this week’s <em>MVC</em>, Rivka and Frank sit down with writer and director Adam McKay — their first Academy Award winner (sadly, nominees don’t count). Adam joins the hosts to discuss the movie <em>Office Space</em>, Mike Judge’s comedic meditation on the modern office. The group breaks down the film’s stark portrayal of worker alienation, the brutality of corporate consultants, and how this movie has become even more relevant almost 25 years after its release.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/d3f4a828/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>Rivka and Frank also dig into this past weekend’s Academy Awards ceremony, the historic win for <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>, and the contradictions of the “follow your dream” acceptance speech.</p>
