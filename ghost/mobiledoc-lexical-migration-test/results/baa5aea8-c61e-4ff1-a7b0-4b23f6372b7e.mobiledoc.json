As the mechs can be quite rigid and slow, the fun that can be had with these are limited however, they do add strategical elements like moving platforms for quick getaways in order to regroup and objects to hide behind to take cover. Some levels also have objects that you can pick up and use as a weapon, as well as glowing areas that will increase your Ultimate meter. They're unique and add variety but with the mechs being so slow, I feel as though that potential is almost wasted."

It has a few hiccups here and there, especially when the voice actors seem to take some creative liberty and slightly deviate from the script but in essence, it has heart and the intention is exciting."
