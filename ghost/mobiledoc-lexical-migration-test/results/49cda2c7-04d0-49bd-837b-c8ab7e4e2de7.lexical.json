These vehicles mainly consist of manufacturer icons such as the Lamborghini Hurrican or Porsche 911. However, it is scarce to see a collection as incredible as this one with probably hundreds of vehicles. This is an astonishing feat of an automotive legend. Deemed \"Germany's Hidden $40 million Car Collection,\" this insane group of vehicles holds some of the world's most valuable cars with price tags well over a million dollars. ",

A stunning white Bently is proudly presented as it shows off its incredible aesthetic and attractive body design.
