<p>On Wednesday 1/27 at 7:30pm ET (4:30pm PT), <em>The Daily Poster</em> will host a live chat about the fight for Medicare for All with Dr. Abdul El-Sayed and Dr. Micah Johnson, who have co-authored a new book on the subject. We will explore a big question: With Democrats controlling the presidency and Congress, what are the prospects for expanding guaranteed health care to all?</p>
<p>Dr. El-Sayed is a physician, epidemiologist, and progressive activist who rebuilt Detroit's Health Department after the City's bankruptcy as the youngest big-city health commissioner in a major U.S. city. He also ran for governor of Michigan in 2018. He is the Chair of Southpaw Michigan and a Political Contributor at CNN. His book, <a href="https://abdulelsayed.com/healingpolitics"><em>Healing Politics: A Doctor’s Journey into the Heart of Our Political Epidemic</em></a>, diagnoses our country’s epidemic of insecurity and the empathy politics we will need to treat it, and his forthcoming book <a href="http://medicareforallbook.com/"><em>Medicare for All: A Citizen’s Guide</em></a><em> .</em></p>
<p>Dr. Micah Johnson is a physician and a health care researcher, writer, and policy advisor. He served as a health policy fellow in the U.S. House of Representatives and has advised presidential campaigns on health care reform.</p>
