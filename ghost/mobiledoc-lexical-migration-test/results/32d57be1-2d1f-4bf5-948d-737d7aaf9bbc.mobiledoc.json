Sometimes people might risk driving the vehicle themselves, although we don’t recommend it. In the video posted to Instagram by account americanmusclehd, a modern Dodge Challenger was taken onto the highway even though it’s crabbing or dog tracking something fierce."

It’s about as bad as the time I saw a woman in a Mustang (with California plates) trying to make it up a steep mountain pass in a snowstorm by pressing the accelerator all the way to the floor. Her rear tires were smoking as they uselessly spun on the icy road, her pony car going nowhere."

We’re taking a shot in the dark here by guessing frame damage is likely the cause, although it could be something else pretty serious. Driving a car with that kind of a problem at any speed, but especially over 55 mph is just asking for trouble in a big way."

A quick Google search will pull up all kinds of videos and photos showing Ford Explorers, Chevy Silverados, and other vehicles looking like they’re driving sideways. On vehicles with a live rear axle, it can be an issue of thrust angle."
