<p>General Motors completely re-imagined <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">the Corvette</a> for its eighth-generation, moving the iconic <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">American sports car</a> more closer to supercar status. Giving the car its ability to sprint to 60-mph from a standstill in less than three-seconds, the 495-horsepower 6.2L V8 engine was moved to a mid-mount position. However, the move was not only about <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">increasing the Corvette’s</a> acceleration but also about optimizing weight distribution. This resulted in a new stance that benefited the new generation’s cornering and handling abilities. It also allowed the use of a more aerodynamic body style which also helps maximize the car's performance as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">The Corvette</a> being raffled is an Arctic White example that features a Carbon Flash painted nacelles and 19-inch front, ­20-inch rear 5-open-spoke aluminum wheels with a machined edge. The black convertible top can be raised or lowered at speeds under 30-mph and a Z51 performance package  increases the cars capability to handle the massive 6.2-liter engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission ensures smooth acceleration, cruising, and shifts. Inside the GT2 bucket seats accent a black interior that is still very much what you would expect from a Corvette.</p>
