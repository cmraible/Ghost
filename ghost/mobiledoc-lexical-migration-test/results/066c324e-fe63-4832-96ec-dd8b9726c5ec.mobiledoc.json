We’ve been living off outtakes from other episodes and other filler content, so finally we’re getting fresh videos from Tom and crew. That does mean we get to hear a muffled Tom as he wears a mask, even though this Steve guy doesn’t. However, this episode is a hell of a way to kick things off again, so let’s hope it sets the right tone for a tremendous season of Barn Find Hunter which hopefully will include even more motorcycles (Tom sounds like he got the hint)."
