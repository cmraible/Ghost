<hr>
<p>We live in a wonderful time <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/carroll-shelby-signature-mustang/">when it comes to vehicle performance</a>. Those days of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle cars</a> barely pushing 200-horsepower are over. Instead, you have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2020-shelby-f-150-super-snake-sport/">multiple options for pushing past the 600-hp mark</a>. The only problem is cost, because let’s be honest, a lot of these modern performance cars are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alpina-z8-crashed/">way outside of most people’s budget</a>. A Ford dealer seems to understand those who aren’t looking for a mortgage-sized car payment might still want to taste what monstrous power from a new car is like.</p>
<p>Beechmont Ford, which is in Cincinnati, Ohio is advertising new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/go-on-a-virtual-tour-of-the-roush-garage/">Roush Mustangs</a> boosted to 750-horsepower. Built using a 2020 Ford Mustang GT and a big Roush Phase 2 supercharger, they’re priced to sell at just $44,994.</p>
<p>For that price you might think the supercharger comes sitting in the backseat, but that includes the installation cost. A six-speed manual transmission is also included, so in many ways this car promises more fun than if you were to sell your eldest child to get into a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/its-time-to-win-a-2020-ford-shelby-gt500/">2020 Shelby GT500</a>.</p>

<p>Not only do you get 750-hp on tap, the supercharger squeezes 670 lb.-ft. of torque out of the 5.0-liter Coyote V8 using 12 psi of boost. It’s a lot of performance per dollar for those who don’t care about having an Alcantara and carbon fiber interior, special badges, and other bragging rights included in much more expensive options.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the dealer isn’t willing to do more. It openly advertises it can and will do all kinds of bespoke upgrades to a Mustang, including custom stripes, wraps, suspension work, etc.</p>
<p>What’s attractive to many is shoppers can finance not only the car but also the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-roush-ford-f150/">Roush</a>parts. That means the potential to not put any money down up front, if you get the right credit approval.</p>
<p>According to Beechmont Ford, These Mustang GTs enhanced with the help of Roush Performance have a 3 years/36,000-mile warranty honored by any Ford dealer from coast to coast.</p>
