<p>The Cougar is a true American classic, that's always been a little different than other V8 powerered sedans. One would come just shy of calling it a muscle car, even though it shares a lot of the same parts as a Ford Mustang. This clean example would be fantastic for top down summer cruises.</p>

<p>There's a few factors to thank for the skyrocketing rise in the popularity of older SUVs, and this Blazer might be the smartest thing you buy this year, if you're looking to cash in on the craze.

<p>SOLD: $8,250</p>
<p>The third-generation Camaro has had a curious and fascinating rise to the top of the modern American muscle/classic market. While popular in its own day, it had a few awkward years when it was regarded as the underdog of the f-body family, only to make one of the biggest comebacks of all time in the last 7 years. Now, this generation Camaro is highly-desirable, and hard to find in this kind of condition. </p>

<p>The Cutlass is another vehicle on the list that skirts the lines of being a muscle car, without actually making the cut for most people. It has an agressive appearance, beefy engine, and is a two-door sedan, combined with mid-range luxury options that appealed to a broader crowd than most cars.</p>

<p>Not putting a reserve on a 1962 Corvette might seem insane, but it also might be a brilliant move by the owner. The iconic last year model of the first-generation Corvettes is a highly-coveted collector car, and fuelie 'Vert. </p>

<p>SOLD: $9,500</p>
<p>This small size truck is a model that's had many hits, and for different reasons, throughout the years. 1980s trucks are hot now because the vintage truck niche is doing so well, but it's also a truck that had success in the mini truck performance market of the early 2000s. Given the modifications, and beefy tires at the rear, this S10 can probably <em>move</em>!</p>

<p>The Toyota Tacoma trucks representive another class of mini/small size trucks, but it's a little different than the S10 above. While the S10 is more performance orentintaed, this Tacoma is a do-it-all kind of truck, with a set of beefy tires and wheels, and the suspension to make it a killer off-roader, or fun weekend truck. Not to mention, it has a manual transmission, so it's going to be a fun truck to drive!</p>
