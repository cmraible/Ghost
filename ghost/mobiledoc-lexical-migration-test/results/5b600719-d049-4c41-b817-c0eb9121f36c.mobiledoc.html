<hr>
<p>There’s always a story about why a car has been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-field-is-full-of-old-porsches/">essentially abandoned on someone’s property</a>. Maybe they insist they’re going to fix it, they got sick, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/streetside-classics-helps-single-mom/">lost their job</a>, or it reminds them too much of their ex-girlfriend. It’s always interesting to find out what the background is, but at the same time it’s sad to see a good classic car decay as it sits. That’s why it’s great to watch this video of a guy rescuing a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c3-corvette-burns-in-seatac/">C3 Corvette</a> which had been sitting for 2 decades.</p>
<p>Essentially left for dead in a guy’s backyard, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-chevrolet-corvette/">1970 Chevrolet Corvette</a> still has its original 350ci <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lt1-trans-am-rediscovered/">LT1</a> V8. At least the car wasn’t completely abused since the owner put a cover over it. still, the paint looks pretty rough, but it no doubt would be far worse had those body panels sat out completely exposed in the baking sun.</p>
<p>At the moment the video was shot, this ’70 Corvette wasn’t running. And while the LT1 isn’t the hottest engine, this isn’t a bad find for a younger enthusiast. You can see in the video his dad owns a first-gen Bronco which looks fully restored, so this car willy likely get all the care it needs.</p>
<p>As for the interior of this C3, it’s going to need some work. The driver’s door panel is removed since they had trouble with the door and window mechanisms. It looks like all the original switchgear and gauges are present, but we’re not sure if everything works or not.</p>
<p>This YouTube channel, Division 7 Motorsports, is fairly new to YouTube. With just 77 subscribers are the writing of this article, we’d love to see this guy pick up at least a few dozen more. No, we’re not getting a cut of his revenues or anything like that, just we love to see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/actually-the-kids-like-classic-cars/">younger enthusiasts</a> get the encouragement they need to keep sharing car content online.</p>
