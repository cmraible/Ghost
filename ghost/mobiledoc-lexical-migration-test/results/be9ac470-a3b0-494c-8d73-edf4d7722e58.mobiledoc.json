That’s a lazy accusation to make against anyone whose hobby involves collecting and taking care of something material, but it so often sticks. But stories like this one of car enthusiasts in Alberta, Canada stepping up big time to take care of two kids after their parents were killed shows off the true heart of the hobby we love."

That decision was tough considering it was always Brent’s dream to pass the classic car down to his children. Still, their health and well-being came first, so they contacted a local auction company and had the Pontiac listed."

That changed everything for those bidding on the Pontiac. One man won the car for the final bid of $29,000 but immediately donated the Parisienne back to the auction house. Then another won it at $30,000 and did the same thing. Finally, a man put in the top bid for the car at $20,000 and gave it back to the Keryluke family."
