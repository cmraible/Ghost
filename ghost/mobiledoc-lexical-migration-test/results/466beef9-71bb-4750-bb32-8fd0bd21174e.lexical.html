<p>A few weeks ago, I mentioned in passing that I was working on a new structure for this site. With that comes a set of deadlines that <em>should</em> get me to into a position where I could generate the sort of flow of posts here that I've aspired to for a long time.</p>
<p>Well, it's finally done, and will be launching later today. I'll make a more general post about it a week or two in, once I'm happy it's running the way I want it to. I'll explain the rationale in more detail then. For now, though, here's a preview for email subscribers <em>only</em> of what's coming. (I'm using Ghost's new ability to <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/email-without-publishing/">send emails <em>without</em> publishing a post</a> on the web to do this…)</p>
<p>Here's the planned weekly minimum on the site:</p>
<h3 id="mondays-technical-tips">Mondays: <em>Technical Tips</em></h3>
<p>A short explanation of something technical that you might need to know to do better journalism: SEO, social, multimedia and the like. Something defined, useful and actionable. Sometimes they'll be timely, like the one that will go out later today. And sometimes they'll just be useful.</p>
<h3 id="wednesdays-tldr">Wednesdays: <em>tl;dr</em></h3>
<p>A short, snappy digest of links to the things you might need to know as a working journalists: developments in search, social, audience strategy and journalism practice. </p>
<p>It'll be broken down clearly into sections, so you can find the ones that are relevant to you. And there will be no more than a sentence or two on each link.</p>
<p>If it's a quiet week, it'll be short. If it's a busy one, it'll be longer. But it'll never be <em>long</em>. </p>
<h3 id="fridays-adams-analysis">Fridays: <em>Adam's Analysis</em></h3>
<p><em>(Temporary name while I think of something better. Suggestions desperately appreciated…)</em></p>
<p>I'll do at least one weekly analysis piece, either on a topical subject, or on some element of journalism or publishing practice that has been on my mind in recent days or weeks. </p>
<h2 id="for-the-future">For the Future</h2>
<p>If this works, and I start to see a big enough uptick in subscribers, I'll start adding:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Interviews</li>
    <li>Explainers on relevant subjects </li>
</ul>
<p>But let's not run before we walk!</p>
<h2 id="other-posts">Other Posts</h2>
<p>It's possible, once I get into the swing of this, that I'll be doing other posts through the week as well. What I haven't decided yet is if I'm going to push <em>everything</em> out as emails. </p>
<p>This is where I'd like to hear from you. Which would you prefer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Everything I publish sent as emails</li>
    <li>A weekly digest of posts I've published outside the structure outlined above?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hit "reply" and let me know…</p>
<h2 id="for-paid-members-only%E2%80%A6">For paid members only…</h2>
<p>At some point, elements of this will go behind the site paywall. I'm not sure which yet — I'll be looking at which elements convert best to new subscribers, and which elements get the most traction in open rates and traffic. But I'll be sure to warn non-paying subscribers before it happens.</p>

<p> So, that's the plan. What do you think?</p>
