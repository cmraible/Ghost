<p>At this point it doesn’t really matter anymore how this <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11055605&avId=903485&pageID=1&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may21">1957 Chevrolet Belair Hardtop</a> was optioned from the factory. Under the ownership of the current owner it has undergone a ground up, frame off restoration that included the stripping, blasting, and recoating of every part of <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11055605&avId=903485&pageID=1&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may21">this car</a>. Every nut, every bolt, and every part was then reassembled with meticulous scrutiny. On top of returning the car to a like new condition, the restoration process also included adding a ton of modern options.   </p>

<p>Underpinnings include all new bushings and mounts, tubular upper and lower control arms with sway bars and coil springs, and a Ford 9" rear axle housing. Power disc brakes are perfectly encased in 17-inch Intro polished mag wheels wrapped in BF Goodrich tires. This resulted in the perfect lowered stance to bring new life to the <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11055605&avId=903485&pageID=1&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may21">classic design</a>. </p>

<p>Inside is an interior that is complete with all the modern amenities one could hope for without covering up the classic feel of the Bel Air. A truly custom tan leather upholstery covers the door panels, buckets seats, and custom built center console and a matching leather wrapped polished steering wheel controls the power steering with style. With options such as Vintage Air AC, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD stereo, this car makes for just as good of a driver as it is a <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11055605&avId=903485&pageID=1&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may21">show car</a>.</p>
<p>While the eye catching attractions are extremely well done, the builder did not stop at just the visible aspects of <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11055605&avId=903485&pageID=1&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=may21">the car</a>. Under the hood sits a fully-built 502 fuel injected engine. Professionally built by Arizona Speed and Marine, the power plant is modified with a custom 502 monoblade throttle body, an electronic distributor and ignition, and a pair of Hooker headers. Matching the common bright red accented in polished alloy theme, the entire engine and bay are detailed to an incredibly high luster.  </p>
