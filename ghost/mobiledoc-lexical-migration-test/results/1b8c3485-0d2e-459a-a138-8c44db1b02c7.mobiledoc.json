Being completely restored, right down to the very last nut and bolt, the car is exactly as it was intended to be straight from the factory. Since completion, this Shelby GT350H has seen very few miles. Other features include a black interior and factory Magnum 500 wheels. In addition to being of a certain caliber, the restoration was also well documented and a photo album does accompany the car which is also documented in the Shelby registry. "
