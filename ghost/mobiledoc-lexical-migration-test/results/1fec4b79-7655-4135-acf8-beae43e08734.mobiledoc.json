With the help of Ontario Provincial Police Dive Team, they recovered seven classic cars, all from the 1970s, which had been sunk into the murky depths. As you might imagine, police suspect the vehicles are all stolen."

Something about sitting underwater for years on end is really hard on cars, so these things are literally falling apart. In other words, if one of these are your old ride and you didn’t get an insurance payout, don’t expect to get anything other than some rotting metal and soggy seat cushions."

          "While the theory of these 1970s cars being stolen isn’t a bad one, there is another possible angle. Unfortunately, some people who are less than honest have decided rather than pay for a car they don’t like or can no longer reasonably afford, it’s best to dump it in a body of water and report it as stolen. Then they get a nice payout from the insurance company. It’s a victimless crime, or so they think. Meanwhile, everyone’s insurance premiums get pumped up by these “thefts” and the accompanying payouts."
