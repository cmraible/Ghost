<hr>
<p>According to the Lakes Area Police Department in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-car-minnesota-lake/">Minnesota</a>, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1975-chevrolet-camaro/">1975 Chevrolet Camaro Convertible</a> was stolen sometime between 9:30 pm September 10 and September 14. Considering that date range runs from a Friday night to a Tuesday, it’s likely the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-driver-does-donuts/">owner</a> was taking a long weekend trip when the thieves struck. Now we’re helping get the word out about this car so hopefully it’s found intact and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1954-morgan-coupe/">returned to the rightful owner</a>.</p>

<p>The police department’s Facebook account says the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/victims-turn-to-social-media/">theft</a> happened in the area of Sharon’s Way and Sportsman Drive. Anyone who’s seen the car or witnessed any suspicious activity in the area during the listed dates should contact police dispatch or email the department tips account. We’re including the original Facebook post with all the information.</p>
<p>Having your car stolen is a horrible feeling, especially if it’s a ride with which you feel an emotional connection. While we don’t know what the owner’s feelings are toward this car, just looking at the photo tells us it’s been well-maintained, so we’re going to go out on a limb here and say it’s been cherished.</p>
<p>Some people might laugh at this news since a 1975 Camaro in their mind isn’t worth much. Sure, it’s not the hottest model year for the Chevy, but for the owner it was obviously something they’ve enjoyed. Obviously, this person wants the classic muscle car back. That alone should be enough to rally other enthusiasts to at least keep their eyes open for it. After all, if you were in this position you’d no doubt want everyone else helping out.</p>
<p>Sadly, car thefts have become all too commonplace in many areas during the past couple of years or so. While the COVID lockdowns were initially blamed for the theft spike, it’s becoming increasingly obvious they at least weren’t the only factor fueling the trend. We hope the thieves are caught soon.</p>
