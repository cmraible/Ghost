<p>Does anyone else miss coffee shops? I do. I <em>really</em> miss coffee shops. For much of the last seven years, one of my very favourite things was heading to my local coffee shop after dropping my daughter(s) at nursery, and spending the first working hour of the day catching up on a mix of email and reading over a black americano.</p>
<p>I miss that. </p>
<p>Grabbing a takeaway and doing the same on the iPad by the river has some appeal, but it's not the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, grab a hot beverage of your choice, and a comfy chair somewhere at home, put on <a href="https://coffitivity.com">some coffee shop sounds</a> and enjoy this quick selection of links. </p>

<p>One of the default Covid-19 stories has become the "crowded beach" story, as people deprived of foreign holidays crowd onto popular beaches. But there's two problems with these stories: they mis-represent the risk, and distracts from more serious issues. </p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is throwing up all sorts of structural weaknesses in the way we report. Here's a really specific example of how a journalist has chosen to frame some reporting ‚Äî probably for attention reasons ‚Äî could have some serious consequences. </p>
