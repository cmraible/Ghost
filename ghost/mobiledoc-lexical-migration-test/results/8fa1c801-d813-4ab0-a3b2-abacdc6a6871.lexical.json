My campaign slogan is a scripture, it’s Isaiah 1:17: “Do good, seek justice, help the widow, the orphan, the oppressed and the poor.” And when I go to churches, and I talk about Medicare for All, I say, “Jesus laid hands on the sick, that was Medicare for All. If it was good for Jesus, it’s got to be good for us.”",

I did five churches yesterday. And all of those churches were full with people who were excited about being able to get out and vote for us. And so I think it’s a strength. And I think that showing the way that I believe and carrying my faith, the way that I do, hopefully gives people some comfort.",
