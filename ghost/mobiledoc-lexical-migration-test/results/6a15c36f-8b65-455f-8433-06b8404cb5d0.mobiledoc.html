<p>The <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1986-porsche-911-carrera-targa-58/">1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa</a> holds a storied place in automotive history. The car's exterior gleams with its special-ordered Meteor Metallic finish, accentuated by a black removable Targa roof panel. It further boasts integrated fog lights and heated power-adjustable side mirrors, showcasing the classic luxury and attention to detail associated with Porsche. However, as the car has journeyed through time, some evidence of age can be seen: a refinished right door, some bubbling paint, a few scratches on the left mirror, and touch-up paint on stone chips - all testaments to its rich history.</p>

<p>Adding to its exterior appeal, this 1986 Carrera Targa rides on black 15-inch Fuchs alloy wheels, measuring 7 inches up front and 8 inches at the rear. These wheels are fitted with Kumho Solus TA11 tires, installed in March 2023. Further enhancements to its performance capabilities include four-wheel disc brakes, with a brake fluid flush and left-front caliper overhaul completed in the same month.</p>
<p>Moving inside, the car is adorned with seats upholstered in black leather. Creature comforts include cruise control, air conditioning, power windows, and an Alpine cassette stereo integrated with a trunk-mounted CD changer and aftermarket speakers. Some quirks of time include a scuff on the left door panel, a missing hazard-light knob, and some stains on the seats. In terms of maintenance, the air conditioning blower motor and relay were recently replaced, though it's worth noting that some of the speakers are not operational.</p>

<p>The car's cockpit houses a MOMO steering wheel, framing VDO instrumentation such as a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline, a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows a respectable 78k miles, with the speedometer transmitter and gear set having been replaced in March 2023.</p>

<p>Under the hood lies a 3.2-liter M930/21 flat-six engine, factory-rated at 202 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Extensive work in March and May 2023 included replacements of the fuel filter, fuel pump, crankshaft position sensor, air filter, spark plugs, fuel tank, and spark plug wires. </p>
