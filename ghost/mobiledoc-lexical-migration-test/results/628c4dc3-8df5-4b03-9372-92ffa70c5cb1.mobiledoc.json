This was made back when Caddies were some of the most elegant and luxurious vehicles on the road, a position the brand unfortunately lost long ago. What’s even more amazing is getting a car like this probably isn’t as cost-preventative as you probably think."

It has the suicide doors, wire spoke wheels, the massive grille, covered spare mounted on the tail, expansive fins all down the engine cowling, that dramatic hood ornament, whitewall tires, and elegant lines everywhere. Metallic Blue Pearl flaunts all of this perfectly, while all the correct trim tops off the amazing details."
