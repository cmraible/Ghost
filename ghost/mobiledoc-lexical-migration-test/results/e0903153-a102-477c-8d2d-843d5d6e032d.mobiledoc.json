The tan paint job is accented by plenty of bright chrome and a stylish set of 20-inch American Racing wheels. The lowered ride height was accomplished by a five-inch drop in the front and a four-inch drop in the rear resulting in a cool look without looking slammed. Inside, the pewter-colored exterior color is accented by a relatively stock looking interior including a bench seat and column shifter. No detail was overlooked when this truck was built, and despite being almost fully customized, it isn't over the top."
