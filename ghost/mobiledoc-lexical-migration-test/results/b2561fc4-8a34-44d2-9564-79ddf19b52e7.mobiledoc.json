I personally found this out a few years ago at SEMA when I walked by someone who I thought was doing a Goldberg impression, only to turn around to find out it was actually the man himself talking to fans and fellow enthusiasts. Obviously, being one of the most successful wrestlers of all time surely affords Bill Goldberg the luxury of buying any car he wants, so what is he spending his money on? Let's dig in!"
