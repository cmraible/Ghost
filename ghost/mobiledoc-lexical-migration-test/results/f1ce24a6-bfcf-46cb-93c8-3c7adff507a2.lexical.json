As you squint your eyes anticipating piles of trash, you start noticing a couple of vintage cars that catch your attention. It starts with a Duster, just one little plymouth duster in a dark green paint color is enough for most to set their attention to the collection. However, this is far from the only cool classic car found within the incredible gathering of vehicles.",

Of those, about 60-ish of them have tags and drive on regular occasions which is a welcome sight compared to other classics in similar conditions. Some of the coolest old cars featured in this location include a late ‘60s or ‘70s El Camino, a 1957 Chevy four-door, and a Ford Falcon. One particular vehicle that caught my attention was a 1964 ½ Ford Mustang which features an engine that fans of the brand should know pretty well. ",

However it was a pretty big deal back in the day as this was the first V8 option available for the Mustang. A fun little side note that I found particularly enjoyable was a classic BMW from the ‘80s, ‘90s, or early 2000s. This incredible BMW is a sleek black classic car with a beautiful style and a nice 2.5-liter straight-six engine. Overall, these are some pretty wonderful cars which add up to a really amazing collection with a ton of history and heritage behind its pieces.",
