<hr>
<p>Action movies and cool cars go together like peanut butter and jelly. So naturally, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">lot of celebrities</a> who are typecast action heroes tend to appreciate these cars in their own life. Action actor Jason Statham is no exception! Statham was a member of Britainâ€™s National Diving Squad, and ranked 12th in the world in 1992, before he was known for acting. Check out his car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rob-gronkowski/">collection</a> below.</p>

<p>I can name the celebrities I know of who don't have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-audi-r8-hpe900-exotic/">R8s</a>, and it would be quicker than listing off the ones who do - and it makes sense, they're great cars. Jason Statham has two of them in his car collection, one in black and the other white. The Audi R8 is powered by a 430-horsepower V8 that can move the car to 60 mph in 4-seconds.</p>
<h3 id="jaguar-e-type">Jaguar E-Type</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/2862b7b6a6ba76cf64a5e28bf68e7783.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="598" height="358"></figure>
<p>A favorite of those with timeless taste and desire to exceed the speed limit, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jaguar-e-type-coupe-chip-foose/">Jaguar E-Type</a> is a classy automobile. It's unclear whether or not Statham actually owns this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-jaguar-xke/">Jaguar</a>, reports are conflicting, but he did arrive to the premier of his movie, The Mechanic, in it, so we'll take it. </p>
<h3 id="lamborghini-murcielago-lp">Lamborghini Murcielago LP</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/2010-07-09-08-42-30-7-jason-statham-the-star-of-transporter-movie.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="480" height="354"></figure>
<p>The Lamborghini Murcielago LP Jason Statham drove in The Transporter must have left an impression on him, because he has an orange one in real life. Obviously, this is one of the fastest cars in the star's collection. This Lambo will hit 60 mph in 3.4-seconds, and is one of only 4,000 built during the ten year production run.</p>
<h3 id="porsche-911-gt2">Porsche 911 GT2</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/6e5e6a79d71a891bde9f61c7a1c204f5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="601" height="400" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/6e5e6a79d71a891bde9f61c7a1c204f5.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/6e5e6a79d71a891bde9f61c7a1c204f5.jpg 601w"></figure>
<p>Statham has been spotted in this Porsche numerous times since 2009. Porsche poured a lot into the 911 GT2. This model can sprint from 0-60 mph in 3.7-second, with a top speed of 204 mph.</p>
<h3 id="aston-martin-dbs">Aston Martin DBS</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/58a98c1c8ac91944c58756a4b3d105db.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/58a98c1c8ac91944c58756a4b3d105db.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/58a98c1c8ac91944c58756a4b3d105db.jpg 640w"></figure>
<p>This Aston Martin DBS makes us want a James Bond movie staring Jason Statham. The beautiful retractable roof Aston Martin is powered by a 510-horsepower 6.0-liter V12 engine.</p>
<h3 id="jaguar-xjr">Jaguar XJR</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/CLrbTFjWwAE2kya.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="640" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/CLrbTFjWwAE2kya.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/02/CLrbTFjWwAE2kya.jpg 640w"></figure>
<p>Statham has this seriously powerful Jaguar XJR. Powering the Jag is a supercharged 5.0-liter V8 that puts 543-horsepower and 503 lbs-ft of torque. </p>
<p>Noticeably missing from the actions star's collection is American influence. We think Statham should get a vintage truck, or a nice muscle car. Maybe he'd even feel more at home in the new C8? But we're not ones to tell people how to spend their money, especially people who could definitely beat us up. </p>
