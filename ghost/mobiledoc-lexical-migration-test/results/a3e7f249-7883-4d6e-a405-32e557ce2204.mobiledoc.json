This time it was the RICS Property Management Awards, held at Cabot Hall over at Canary Wharf. It made a pleasant change from the normal hotels, with the high ceiling, huge open side and views over the docks. Summer lunchtime dining can be very pleasant indeed.Not much else to say about this picture, really. I just like the pattern the tables make across the hall and the stream of people making their way towards their lunch.\n\n</td></tr></table>\n"
