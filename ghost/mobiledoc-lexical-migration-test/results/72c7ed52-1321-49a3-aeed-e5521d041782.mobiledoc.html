<p>We’re constantly amazed at how many people <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bumper-stickers/">can’t control their muscle cars</a>. That seemed to be the case when reports of a yellow Ford Mustang which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-man-crashes-dodge-charger/">crashed into the front of a house</a> in British Columbia popped up online. However, investigation of the evidence shows it wasn’t a muscle car and there’s more to the story than <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/curse-of-dodge-challenger/">a lack of driving skills</a>.</p>
<p>According to police in Vernon, a 26-year-old woman was driving her yellow S197 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-accident/">Mustang</a> convertible while impaired, which led to the crash at about 4:10 pm on October 25. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/drivers-doing-donuts-in-parking-lot/">pony</a>came to rest in a front bedroom, slightly injuring one person in the house and both people in the car. One person in the house wasn’t injured at all. Thankfully, nobody was killed or seriously hurt.</p>
<p>Still, the house was so badly damaged authorities made the occupants evacuate. They also switched off the gas and electricity before dragging the wrecked little pony out and towed it away.</p>
<p>About this S197 not being a muscle car: some people believe no Mustang, Camaro, Challenger, etc. should ever be called a pony car. That might’ve been the case long ago, but the definition of American muscle cars has shifted over time and the vehicles themselves have evolved.</p>
<p>However, we wouldn’t call this Mustang a muscle car since it’s clearly a V6 model. While there’s a heated debate over whether something without a V8 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/saleen-mustang-2fast-2furious/">can be considered muscle</a>, in general we’d say no (and there’s even a disagreement among the Motorious team on this one). When a V8 is available for a car, you just can’t call one with a V6 or even worse a turbocharged 4-banger a muscle car.</p>
<p>The Mustang driver was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle but was released from custody after submitting to a screening process. A future court date will determine her fate.</p>
