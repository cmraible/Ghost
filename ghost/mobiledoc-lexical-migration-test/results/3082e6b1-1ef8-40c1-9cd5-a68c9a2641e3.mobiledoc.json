However, the qualifications for these archetypes of asphalt need not all be bad. For instance, many of the big and heavy boats of yesteryear also came equipped with luxury beyond its time. This led to the term “Land Yacht” which better expresses the car's focus on luxury and style. One of the most prolific manufacturers of these behemoths is Lincoln, they have always made quite the name for themself because of the brand's focus on comfort and commodity."
