<p>Of all the classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIm11c3RhbmciXX0=">Ford Mustangs</a> out there, one of the least understood historically has been the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/188441/1972-ford-mustang-mach-i-r-code">1972 Ford Mustang Mach I R-Code</a>. It’s an extremely rare <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/american-muscle">American muscle car</a> that uses a slightly detuned version of the Boss 351’s V8, something Ford called the 351 H.O. That means this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">car</a>,  which is up for auction right now, is a very good candidate for  collectability, especially since people are starting to truly wake up to  its significance.</p>

<p>Thanks to a restoration, the original Bright Red exterior on this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford">Ford</a> has excellent shine and depth, really accentuating those muscular,  simple body panels to perfection. It also has left the red interior with  vinyl bucket seats looking excellent and in factory condition, so you  get to enjoy how this car was when it left the factory.</p>
<p>Anyone should expect the Mach I to hook up from a dead start quite  nicely, something the 9-inch rear with 3.91 gears does exceptionally  well. Of course, if you want to do a nice burnout, you have some  Goodyear Polyglas GT radials to smoke. They’re wrapped around Magnum 500  wheels, which look fantastic sitting still or when the car’s in motion.</p>
<p>Not just a car for going fast in a straight line, the Competition  Suspension uses staggered rear shocks for surprisingly crisp control  through turns. Another nice detail is the correct carb, so you can show  that off with pride.</p>
<p>There are some nice features in this pony, like the rev limiter,  tinted glass, and AM/FM radio. Quite a few NOS parts were used in the  restoration work, so you’re getting good quality.</p>
<p>Ford only made 336 of these cars for 1972, so this isn’t something  you’ll see too often. In fact it’s considered a unicorn for many.
