However, that can cause some tension with a significant other who’s solely focused on living space. Fortunately, for the well-heeled shopper looking to move to northwestern Arkansas there’s a property for sale right now that’s beautiful, spacious, and has its own private racetrack."

For a mere $6.7 million you get a beautiful 5 bedroom 6.5 bath 7,764 sq. ft. mansion situated on 393.37 acres. That’s where you get to drive as fast as you want on the 1.2-mile asphalt track which winds around the property, completely eliminating the temptation to participate in street racing."

Sure, this isn’t a quarter-mile dragstrip, it’s a road coarse with turns, which is fun. If you can afford this place, you can probably also afford to add a drag strip as well and there’s already plenty of room for it."
