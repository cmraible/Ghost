The game gives the player more and more dynamic and fast movement options, such as double and triple jumps, dashes and midair dashes, but rather than feeling dynamic and freeing, it oftentimes feels like the zombie under the player’s control is more of a pinball with a life bar that is unable to stop itself from slamming face-first into spikes, enemies, monsters and the knife drawer on the way to the kitchen. Sometimes, trying to double jump onto a platform will have the zombie shoot off like a rocket the very moment his feet touch it as a buffered input rather than slowing down the momentum; and then of course, there will always be stage hazards in wait.

Weapons quickly become victims of power creep for upgraded versions of the same weapon, often only one or two areas later as the player kills a new enemy, obtains a new material and is immediately able to craft the next thing. The meals themselves all have different effects but some are potentially game-breaking by themselves or end up being shallow, resulting in a poor fit to the game’s high speed, low control, all-over-the-place combat. Everything is worth experimenting with once but many of these undercooked options lack seasoning."
