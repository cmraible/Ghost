<p>Good things are happening! Biden is under growing pressure to stop fighting student debtors in bankruptcy court, following <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> ongoing reporting on the issue. Baby boomers, meanwhile, are pulling their money out of the banks financing the climate crisis. And the Virginia state senate just blocked Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin from appointing a Trump EPA administrator to oversee the state's environmental and resource agencies.</p>
<h3 id="groups-call-on-biden-to-stop-fighting-beleaguered-debtors">Groups Call On Biden To Stop Fighting Beleaguered Debtors:</h3>
<p><em>In the past two weeks, the Biden administration <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-withdrawing-student-debt-appeal-after-outcry/"><em>has dropped</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/despite-pledge-biden-still-fighting-student-debtors-in-court/"><em>two appeals</em></a> of legal victories for student debtors in bankruptcy court, after </em>The Daily Poster<em> reported on the cases. But the administration still hasn’t said it will stop fighting the dozens of other struggling student loan borrowers trying to have their debt discharged through bankruptcy.</em></p>
<p><em>So on Thursday, 17 advocacy organizations <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/coalition-letter-to-secretary-cardona-withdraw-all-oppositions-to-student-debt-discharge-in-bankruptcy-court/"><em>sent a letter</em></a> to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, demanding the Education Department drop its cases against these borrowers. “We ask the Department to immediately cease its practice of opposing borrowers seeking student loan relief in the bankruptcy process,” the letter said. “We also ask the Department to review all positions taken in such cases during your Administration, and work with borrowers to assure a just outcome… Through it all, the Department should be a leading voice for students, and should refrain from taking legal positions that raise the bar for distressed borrowers.”</em></p>
<p><em>At a Friday press conference on student debt cancellation, </em>The Daily Poster <em>asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) if he supported these organizations’ demand. “Yes, absolutely,” he said, adding, “It’s outrageous that other people get to declare bankruptcy but students can’t,” referring to the carve-out for student debt in bankruptcy that makes it very challenging for people declaring bankruptcy to have their student loans discharged.</em></p>

<h3 id="congress-might-have-to-stop-insider-trading">Congress Might Have To Stop Insider Trading:</h3>
<p><em>While we’re on the topic of top Democrats facing pressure to do good things, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.axios.com/pelosi-stock-trading-ban-congress-069dc627-71fd-490f-a005-510bbd18cce2.html"><em>announced this week</em></a> that she supports a law that bans lawmakers from trading stocks. By nature of their jobs, lawmakers have access to inside information that might allow them to beat the stock market in their trades. Indeed, <a href="https://prospect.org/power/congress-beats-wall-street-at-its-own-game/"><em>they</em></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4SoNPXHtMg"><em>almost always</em></a> do. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-stock-act-violations-senate-house-trading-2021-9"><em>very few of them actually</em></a> are held accountable for insider trading. Pelosi had <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1471152961577439234?s=20&t=r6UeJLieBhtzopgIFHFtHA"><em>said in December</em></a> that she did not support such a ban because lawmakers should be able to participate in the “free market economy.” (Her husband has <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/08/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-husband-paul-big-tech-stocks/"><em>made millions</em></a><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pelosis-husband-bought-google-disney-call-options-that-would-pay-off-if-bull-market-continues-11640894240"><em>on lucrative</em></a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosis-stock-trades-attract-growing-following-online-2022-01-26/"><em>stock market bets</em></a> over the past couple of years.) But, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/09/stock-trading-ban-congress-pelosi-aoc/"><em>under pressure</em></a> from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/us/politics/democrats-congress-stocks-trading.html"><em>vulnerable</em></a> conservative Democrats, she seems to have caved.</em></p>

<p><em>“What really should scare the corporate and political bad actors is the prospect of old and young people connecting, because there is real power if we work across generations,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/opinion/older-americans-power.html"><em>wrote Bill McKibben and Akaya Windwood</em></a>, founder and lead advisor of the new advocacy organization Third Act in the </em>New York Times<em> this week. Their <a href="https://thirdact.org/"><em>new organization</em></a> is working to organize people over the age of 60 “on issues of climate change, racial equity, and the protection of democracy.” The organization’s first major campaign, “Banking On Our Future,” is encouraging customers of the banks financing the climate crisis — including Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, and Wells Fargo — to close their accounts and move their money elsewhere. (If you aren’t a customer of those banks, <a href="https://thirdact.salsalabs.org/bankingonourfuturepledge-individuals/index.html"><em>you can pressure them</em></a> in other ways.)
