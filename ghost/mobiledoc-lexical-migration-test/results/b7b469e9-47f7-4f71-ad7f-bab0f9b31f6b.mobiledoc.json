          "The first-generation Camaro is a model known chiefly for its incredible style, high production numbers, and massive power options. Taking the automotive world by the story as the Mustang's first real competitor, the Camaro has now become a cultural icon within the American automotive community. One particularly eager group of individuals is the restomodders, regarded as the car world's mad scientists and mechanical wizards. This Camaro holds true to that sentiment very well, as you'll see from its incredible powertrain. However, the real journey begins with the outside of this stunning custom Chevrolet Camaro, which is more than "

          "First of all, this is a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro which could be regarded as one of the best looking cars of its kind due to its dark color scheme and low stance. The exterior projects the car's status as a heavily worked-on vehicle with custom body molding, pocketed C6-style, front lip splitter, and custom rear diffuser. Following the performance-oriented style of this Camaro is a rear spoiler that molds perfectly flush with the rest of the car's bodywork. All of this aerodynamic modification is made to improve handling and performance both on and off the racing track."

          "Under the hood is a massive LSA V8 crate engine, highly regarded as one of Chevy's most powerful internal combustion engines. On top of that enormous V8, you'll also find a powerful supercharger that helps the car make a whopping 525 horsepower and 580 ft/lbs of torque at the rear wheels. These incredible power figures can easily spin the tires and rip through the quarter-mile track. This adds to a fantastic car with a ton of work done to make it one of the coolest Camaro resto-mods we've ever seen. "
