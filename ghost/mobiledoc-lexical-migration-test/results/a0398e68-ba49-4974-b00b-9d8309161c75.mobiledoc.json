The power seats can be adjusted six different ways, and the sea of carpet inside appears as brand new. Once you open the rear suicide doors, the power windows automatically lower about four inches to make room for the convertible top. Once you close the doors, the windows then roll back up into place. When operating, the top is a sight to behold with ten relays, five reversing motors, and thirteen limited switches that all work together in harmony. Even better, the top can be powered whether inside or outside the vehicle with a key near the gas cap. The convertible top automatically locks and unlocks from the windshield bar. "
