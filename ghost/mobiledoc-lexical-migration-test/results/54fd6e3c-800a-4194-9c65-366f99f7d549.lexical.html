<p>This week, <em>The Lever</em>’s podcasts offer some important and thought-provoking conversations. On <em>Lever Time</em>, we share our <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/cb27bd5c">exclusive interview between David Sirota and U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio</a> (D-Penn.), whose congressional district is near the site of the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Chris conveys the sense of anger and fear he’s received from his constituents, as well as his plans for holding Norfolk Southern accountable.</p>
<p>On <em>Movies vs. Capitalism</em>, <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/c69b6135">hosts Rivka and Frank are joined by comedian Ele Woods for a fun and thoughtful discussion</a> about the 1988 classic <em>Working Girl</em>. The group unpacks the cultural relevance of being a “girlboss” and how it challenges the patriarchy while reinforcing capitalism. <em>The Audit</em> is still on hiatus, but will return soon with more mind-numbing “educational” content.</p>

<p>The group unpacks how this movie is the prototypical “girl boss” film, how it brilliantly portrays the predatory male gaze dominant in 1980s cinema, and how Melanie Griffith’s voice is the original ASMR. Ele also shares why “maintain and mend” is her new anti-capitalist mantra, and Frank and Rivka discuss Bernie Sander’s recent media tour.</p>

<p><em>The Audit</em>’s study group has now completed two separate mini-seasons. First, they audited George W. Bush’s MasterClass on authentic leadership (which was terrible), and then they audited political consultants David Axelrod and Karl Rove’s MasterClass on campaign strategy and messaging (which was somehow worse). Make sure to catch up on all of the episodes below!</p>
