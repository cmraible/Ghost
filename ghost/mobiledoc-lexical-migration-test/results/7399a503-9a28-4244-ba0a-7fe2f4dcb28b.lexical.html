<h3 id="this-is-a-lot-more-than-your-average-modified-car">This is a lot more than your 'average' modified car!</h3>
<p>Typically, when modifications are done to a car, it’s done with the sole purpose of end user enjoyment in mind, and not much thought goes into valuation. Now don’t get me wrong, I am not saying 'restoration' - that is a whole different ballgame, and I am not saying that it is never a consideration, just that it is typical that it is not and when it is, the expectation of value may be a bit askew from reality.</p>
<p>That is an unfortunate reality for this hobby, lifestyle, or whatever you prefer to call it. However one person's misfortune can be another’s goldmine. In 2007 one enthusiast bought his/her dream car and when it started to seem a bit dated in 2013, just as many of us gear heads would do, the owner proceeded to update rather than replace. Well over $120,000 later, what was left was a <a href="https://inventory.davisautosports.com/vehicles/236/2007-chevrolet-corvette-900hp-built-over-120k-invested">Corvette Z06</a> that the engineers of 2007 at Chevy could only wish they could have created them selves.</p>

<p>Often seen at regional shows and Corvette outings, this stunning black and green 2007 Corvette Z06 rides on a perfect set of custom Forgiato 20” GTR wheels wrapped in Nitto Invo's 275/30/20's in the front and 345/25/20's in the rear. The color scheme features work completed by Laid Not Sprayed Vinyl Workz in Fredericksburg, VA and the powder coated and hydro dipped parts were handled by Custom Functionz in Waldorf, MD.</p>

<p>A completely custom interior for the car was fashioned by Southern Trucks out of Lady Smith, VA featuring Ostrich skin with green leather inserts with black suede liners. Further bringing the cars interior up to date is an Alpine Stereo system consisting of an INA W900BT head unit, two PDX-M6 amps, one PDX-F4 amp, (X) series speakers with two 12" (R) series woofers, and two 10.4 LCD monitors.</p>

<p>Providing the car with an ample 900-horsepower/700 RWHP @ 5 PSI of boost is a Tick performance built supercharged engine utilizing a three stage methanol injection system. Tick also rebuilt the transmission and it has barely even been broken in. This enthusiast put together the perfect ’07 Vette and then traded it in for a new ZR1 giving <a href="http://davisautosports.com">Davis Auto Sports</a> customers the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
