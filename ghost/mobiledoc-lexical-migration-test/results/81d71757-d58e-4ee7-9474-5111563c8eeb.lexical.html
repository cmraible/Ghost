<p>This <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/impala?promo=MOTORIOUS17">Regal Red 1966 Impala</a> is one of only 1,856 full-size Chevy cars to receive the 425-horsepower Turbo-Jet V8 engine. A Muncie M21 four-speed and Positraction is fed by the rarely used power plant. The car also features a special suspension equalization package, metallic brakes, and a heavy duty generator.
