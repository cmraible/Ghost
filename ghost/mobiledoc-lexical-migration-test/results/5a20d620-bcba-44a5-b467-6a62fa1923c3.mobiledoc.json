At least it's a complete car, though, as the original tool kit, jack, spare tire all come with the car as does a pair of original ignition and door keys. These kinds of details are often overlooked when talking about an ALL-original classic car."

In May of 1962, the owner was complaining of engine issues, so an imported cars dealer in Northern Ohio pulled the engine, tore it down, checked the clearances and rebuilt the engine after apparently finding no problem  – all at a cost of just $80! The owner even sent a letter to Alfa Romeo's North American headquarters to find out the engine's optimal oil pressure, and that response is included with the documentation. Sadly, the current seller states that the engine hasn't been started, but the engine definitely isn't locked up."
