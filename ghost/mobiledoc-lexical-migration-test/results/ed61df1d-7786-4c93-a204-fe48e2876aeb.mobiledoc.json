As your eyes begin to clear and adjust, you notice you are at a small table in the middle of a dark room while a dim lantern faintly illuminates a figure across from you. To your left, you see a set of scales, to your right, a pair of pliers and a small knife. Noticing that you’re awake, the figure slowly reveals his toothy grin and stares at you with malice and excitement. The figure slowly places something on the table without breaking eye contact with you, his maniacal grin changing shape to form words.
