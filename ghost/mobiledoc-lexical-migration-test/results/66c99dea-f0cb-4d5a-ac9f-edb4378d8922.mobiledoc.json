This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of inflation, the current administration going hard against “big oil,” and soaring inflation as we print money like there’s literally no tomorrow. According to AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas across the nation is $4.52."

          "Not shockingly, the land of taxes, otherwise known as California, boasts the highest average price for gas at $6.02 a gallon. Until Monday, three states were holdouts, staying below an average of $4 a gallon. But then Georgia, Kansas, and Oklahoma joined the rest of us in emptying out their wallets at the pump. Some analysts are projecting gas will be an average of $5 a gallon by July 4, just in time to celebrate our freedom."

How do they think all those things they buy at the store get there? How do they think the workers who are remodeling their house get themselves and all the building materials onsite? Skyrocketing gas and diesel prices help drive further inflation, so things are poised to get even worse."

While there are obvious culprits, the fact government regulation with ever-increasing safety standards have made cars heavier than ever sure isn’t helping with the situation. Nor is the fact people are hauling around more extra cargo weight than ever."
