Perhaps it was because of financial struggles or maybe some greed, either  way the driver eventually began stealing cars in 1995 and slowly growing his operation as the years passed. Nowadays, more than 27 years later, the police have finally apprehended the alleged car thief and charged the suspected car-bandit with some pretty insane feats. It's actually pretty impressive how this man was able to get away with his acts for so long before things inevitably caught up to him. So you might be wondering, what all do they say he did?",

On top of all this he also has three wives and some children which might actually make you feel sorry that he’ll likely be seeing the inside of a jail cell soon. However, he also probably killed three people in the process of stealing cars so if he really did all of this stuff then there is no empathy coming from me. All of these things  are accusations  at this point but we hope the people responsible for the theft of that many cars are brought to justice and given consequences for their actions.",
