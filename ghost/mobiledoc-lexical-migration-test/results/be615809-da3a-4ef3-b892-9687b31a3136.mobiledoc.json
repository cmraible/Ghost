Robbing a bank is never a good idea, which we apparently have to say up front lest someone think we’re advocating something. Anyway, we’re sure some people will think having a red Ford Mustang to run from the cops is a great idea while others will think it’s about the dumbest thing they’ve ever heard. But that’s just what a Florida man did back on January 6, we’re assuming to fulfill one of his new year’s resolutions or something."

As police pursued the suspect, he reportedly pushed his little pony to 130 mph, probably thinking the cops would just give up since in some areas they let criminals just drive off without doing anything."

After a few moments the guy came out again, ran to the Mustang, grabbed something, then went back inside."
