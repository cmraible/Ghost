<hr>
<p>During the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-henry-ford-shuts-down-for-coronavirus-outbreak/">coronavirus shutdowns</a>, we gearheads have seen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nhr/">races, shows, and other events canceled</a> right and left. Even <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-museums-are/">car museums shuttered their doors</a>. Thankfully, many of these fine facilities from around the world have been sharing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tour-petersen-automotive-museums-hot-rods-in-the-vault/">online videos and more to keep us entertained and informed</a> while we’ve been cooped up as well. Now things are loosening up and we’re seeing more of these facilities reopening, including <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/virtual-petersen-automotive/">Petersen Automotive Museum</a>.</p>

<p>That’s right, starting on Friday, June 19, 2020 the car museum <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/digitally-tour-two-top-tier-car-museums/">located in Los Angeles, California</a> will open its doors to the public for the first time in months. As you probably already suspect, this reopening will come with social distancing and other measures designed to slow the spread of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/covid19-industry-disruptor/">COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>According to an official press release from the museum, staff will be adhering to health and safety guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State of California, and County of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Everyone in the museum, staff and visitors, will be required to wear a face mask at all times. Social distancing will be enforced, with navigation paths around the exhibits marked, something you might have already seen in stores and other places. The staff will be cleaning the facilities more often. Hand sanitizing stations, which we assume are hand sanitizer dispensers, will be located on each floor.</p>
<p>Special exhibits which were on display before the shutdown haven’t been removed, so if you were planning on going and couldn’t, you don’t have to miss out. These include “Reclaimed Rust: The James Hetfield Collection,” “Hollywood Dream Machines: Vehicles of Science Fiction and Fantasy,” and “Building an Electric Future” presented by Volkswagen.</p>
<p>There’s some bad news: the understandably popular Forza racing simulators will be closed until further notice. Same thing goes for the Discovery Center, an area that’s great for teaching kids. While that’s disappointing, it’s understandable why those areas won’t be accessible.</p>
<p>Another change is the schedule for the Petersen Automotive Museum. Until further notice, it will be open Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 am to 5 pm. You can buy tickets ahead of time on the museum’s website, which we strongly suggest since a lot of people no doubt are chomping at the bit to visit.</p>
