<p>Friends:</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> has been breaking open big stories about corrupt politicians holding up the reconciliation bill — and the work is  having a huge impact, as illustrated by a must-watch TV clip from last night.</p>
<p>But as a reader-supported news outlet, we need your help to keep doing the work. <strong>We need our free subscribers to </strong><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong> to use a special discount to become paying subscribers right now.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe, you get access to our podcasts, live events like our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/public-record-request-seminar-on-9-15/">open record request seminar</a>, and exclusive content like our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizens-guide-to-holding-the-powerful-accountable/">Citizens Guide</a> — and you directly fund our follow-the-money reporting that was featured on NBC’s network last night.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1445559997421608965?s=20">Click here to watch the clip</a>. As you’ll see, the segment begins with our original exclusive reporting on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">Senator Kyrsten Sinema being bankrolled by Big Pharma</a>, and ends with our reporting on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/follow-the-pharma-money/">three pharma-bankrolled House Democrats</a> trying to kill drug pricing legislation.</p>

<p>Our reporting is intensifying pressure on corporate Democrats and being <a href="https://twitter.com/CopperCourier/status/1445796610529583108?s=20">featured in the local Arizona press</a>. One lawmaker recently <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1444001859480469519">said our journalism is making a major impact</a> in the debate on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>But again, we cannot continue to do this work without you. <strong>We really need as many of our free subscribers to pitch in and <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0">use this special discount</a> right now.</strong></p>
<p>Look, I don’t like asking folks to pitch in. But if you <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1445741909889073165?s=20">take a look</a> at how corporate media is distorting the political debate right now, you’ll see exactly why reader-supported media like <em>The Daily Poster</em> is so necessary.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
