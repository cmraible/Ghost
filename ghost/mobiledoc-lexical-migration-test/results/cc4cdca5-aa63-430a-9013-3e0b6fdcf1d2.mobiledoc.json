          " drew attention towards the brand, unlike anything GM had up their sleeve back then. This particular model, built in 1956, uses a 292 cubic inch V8 engine which was pretty intense for the time especially when you consider most cars back then were in line sixes. It's also incredible to look at the body and notice a distinct lack of blemishes which comes from years of having been properly maintained. This all seems fantastic but it certainly isn't the only blue oval brand luxury Cruiser that stands out from that time."

Just like the previously mentioned vehicle, this one presents a pretty impressive V8 engine but this time holding 360 cubic inches of displacement. Altogether, this was good for making around 285 horsepower which was then sent through an automatic transmission. Once again like the Sunliner, this is a convertible of which only 2,447 were made."

          " which might impress you with its simplistic interior design and extreme Rarity. Under the hood, you'll find a six-cylinder engine with an automatic transmission so maybe it's not the fastest thing on the road but you certainly won't see many of them driving around. Only 1,002 of these were made and the full nut and bolt restoration ties it all together. Overall these are three incredibly interesting and rare classic automobiles that you certainly won't want to miss if you like collecting converters. "
