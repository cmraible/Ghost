<p>I don't sing the praises of LumaFusion nearly enough on here. I've put some time in over the last couple of months getting to know it well, and it's really paid off. I was able to knock out this social video-style short in literally 10 minutes over a cup of coffee:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/327671914?app_id=122963" width="360" height="360" frameborder="0" title="Beach Clean" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p>Yeah, it's not a superb video, but it's good enough for my own personal social accounts, and the time/reward ratio is pretty damn good. If you're familiar with Final Cut Pro X or Adobe Premiere Pro, it's fairly easy to get to grips with, once you figure out how to find where the various functions are tucked away in the touch interface.</p>
<p>Honestly, once you get into the habit of editing vide0 with touch on an iPad Pro, it's hard to go back to working on a Mac or PC. It's so much more intuitive "touching" the footage. </p>
<p>(The fact that my aging MacBook Pro struggles with 4k footage, but iPad Pro handles it with ease helps, too.)</p>
<p>I'm pretty confident that, for most people, this is as much video editing power as they need. Certainly, if you're not a pro doing three social videos a day, every day, this is more than enough for you. </p>
<p>And the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8">price is <em>very</em> hard</a> to argue with.</p>
<p>What a great piece of software. </p>
