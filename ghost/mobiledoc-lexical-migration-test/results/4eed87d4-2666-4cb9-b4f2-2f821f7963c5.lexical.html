<p>On Tuesday, <em>The Hill </em>published an <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/577229-beware-the-tea-party-of-the-left?rl=1">opinion piece</a> by former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman in which the Democrat-turned-independent gushed over Sen. Joe Manchin’s “sensible suggestion” to stall debate on Democrats’ reconciliation package. It’s no surprise that Lieberman likes Manchin: Not only has the West Virginia Senator taken up Lieberman’s old corporate Democratic villain role, but Manchin’s attempts to sabotage his own party’s social agenda play right into the hands of Lieberman’s Wall Street masters.</p>
<p>Also, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is refusing to consider higher taxes on the wealthy corporations — after voting no on the Trump tax cuts and campaigning against them.</p>

<p>“This was a crusade without precedent in America, and it was something short of a miracle that this professor-Senator, a devotee of poetry and philosophy, could become a serious contender for the Presidency. It proved that a large segment of the American population is ready and eager for Humanization… indicating that hope and the will for change are alive.” — Philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm on 1968 presidential candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy in his book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Revolution_of_Hope.html?id=SVdy0rtho0kC"><em>The Revolution of Hope: Toward A Humanized Technology</em></a><br></p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is reportedly demanding that Democrats impose a $60,000 family income cap on their child tax credit and “a firm work requirement,” as part of their health care, climate, and anti-poverty reconciliation package, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit"><em>Axios</em></a>.</p>
<p>New experimental data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp39.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a> reveals the devastating impact of such restrictions. According to the data, nearly three quarters of households that reported receiving a child tax credit payment in the past month say that they are either mostly spending it or using it to pay off debt, rather than mostly saving it.</p>
<p>Moreover, two thirds of households earning between $75,000 and $100,000 report mostly spending their child tax credit or using it to pay off debt. Even a slim majority of families earning between $150,000 and $200,000 say they are putting their child tax credit to use, not saving it.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>“Beware the tea party of the left,” former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman wrote in an <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/577229-beware-the-tea-party-of-the-left?rl=1">opinion piece</a><strong></strong>Tuesday in <em>The Hill</em> praising conservative Manchin for stalling Democrats’ $3.5 trillion economic, health care, and climate reconciliation package. </p>
<p>We all of course remember Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-Independent, from his role as the rotating corporate villain in the Democratic caucus during President Barack Obama’s first term. Lieberman <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/11/how_joe_lieberman_helped_the_d.html">helped crush efforts</a> to include a public option in Democrats’ 2010 Affordable Care Act, and also killed a compromise plan to allow people to buy into Medicare at age to 55 — despite having <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/12/oh_no_joe.html">publicly supported the latter idea</a> three months earlier. </p>
<p>Now, Lieberman has come to pay his respects to one of the Democratic Party’s current primary corporate villains, Manchin. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>“When Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) made the sensible suggestion to put a ‘strategic pause’ on the reconciliation debate to give Congress the proper time to review and discuss these proposals that touch almost every facet of American life — from child care and education to health care and energy and climate change — he was unfairly shouted down as a traitor to the Democratic party,” Lieberman wrote.</p>
<p>He continued: “Rather than accepting the limits of their political power, the tea party of the left is working to leverage it into more than it really is. Rather than seeking common ground with more moderate Democrats and Republicans, they use over-the-top rhetoric to demonize them, and presume that any difference of opinion is born of corruption or greed.”</p>
<p>Speaking of corruption: Lieberman works for a lobbying firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, a fact that was not disclosed in the piece. While he generally avoids registering to lobby, Lieberman’s firm bio suggests he represents clients that could have an interest in shredding Democrats’ reconciliation bill. According to <a href="https://www.kasowitz.com/people/joseph-i-lieberman">Kasowitz’s website</a>, Lieberman “assists corporate clients on homeland and national security, defense, health, energy, environmental policy, and intellectual property matters.” </p>
<p><em>The Hill</em> column does note that Lieberman is the “the founding chairman of No Labels.” It does not mention that No Labels is a dark money organization <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/08/26/no-labels-billionaire-donors-josh-gottheimer/">actively working</a><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/22/no-labels-reconciliation-infrastructure-sinema/">to block</a> Democrats’ reconciliation bill, and a pro-business front group that <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-no-labels-went-from-preaching-unity-to-practicing-the-dark-arts">looks to raise money</a> from Wall Street and billionaire GOP donors.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/16/joe-manchin-leaked-billionaire-donors-no-labels/"><em>The Intercept</em></a> reported that Manchin had just held a Zoom call with No Labels, billionaire investors, and Lieberman, where Manchin named some items he wanted to cut from the reconciliation bill. </p>
<p>Lieberman praised Manchin in another interview earlier this week with the <a href="https://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-joe-lieberman-new-book-centrist-solution-20211018-j5rjlmqh3jhmhg3ttm7undg4mm-story.html"><em>Hartford Courant</em></a>, telling the paper, “I admire what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>“As another great Democratic leader might say, I feel Joe Manchin’s pain,” he said. “He’s been really targeted by people in the Democratic Party, but he is fighting for the type of government that he has fought for most of his life. So they’ve got to accommodate him. That’s the nature of the process.”</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., is attempting to single-handedly block Democrats from paring back Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations to fund the social and climate measures in their reconciliation bill — even though she voted against those Trump tax cuts in the House and then even campaigned against them during her Senate bid.</p>
<p><em>Politico</em><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/20/sinema-democrat-tax-plan-corporations-516364">reported</a> Wednesday that “Sinema remains opposed to one of the party's chief goals of raising tax rates on high-income earners and corporations,” adding that this “increasingly appears like a red line” for the senator. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> separately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-cut-programs-durations-to-lower-cost-of-social-policy-and-climate-plan-11634747582?st=mgyw7jlt1ti2ac6&reflink=article_copyURL_share">reported</a> that Sinema “has told lobbyists that she is opposed to any increase in those rates.”</p>
<p>Neither story mentioned Sinema <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2017699">voted no</a> on the Trump tax cuts as a House lawmaker and also opposed them during her 2018 campaign for Senate.</p>
<p>“A broken Congress failed again to deliver for hardworking Arizonans,” Sinema <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171222221235/https://sinema.house.gov/latest-news/sinema-statement-on-partisan-tax-bill/">said</a> of the tax law when it passed in late 2017. “Arizonans want fiscally responsible tax reform that gives families a chance to get ahead.” She added: “I’m ready to fix the problems and mistakes that will inevitably become clear as we learn more about the harmful consequences of this rushed and partisan tax bill.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>But a few weeks later, during the final days of her Senate campaign, Sinema <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/advertiser/AR436514912320094208/creative/CR354329716678721536">ran</a><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/advertiser/AR436514912320094208/creative/CR354329716678721536">a digital ad</a> criticizing the Trump tax law, attacking Trump and her Republican opponent Martha McSally for supporting "huge tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations at the expense of our middle class.”</p>
