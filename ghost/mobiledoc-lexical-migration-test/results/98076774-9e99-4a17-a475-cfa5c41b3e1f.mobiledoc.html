<p><a href="https://tri-industries.tapkat.org/wina2020fordshelbygt500?promo=MOTOR1">Finished in the stunning color</a> of Rapid Red topped with painted white stripes, Ford made sure that this all-new Shelby's bark was as aggressive as its bite. A set of 20-inch exposed carbon fiber wheels sit on all four corners and come wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber. A wheel lock kit is also included. Other exterior highlights include the exposed carbon fiber GT4 track wing and carbon fiber splitter wickers. A Shelby Car Cover is also provided to protect the car when not nestled inside the garage. With a menacing design and style, this incredible GT500 is bound to turn heads no matter where it goes. </p>
<p>The most powerful production Ford to date is powered by a supercharged 5.2-liter cross-plane crank V8 engine that generates a staggering 760-horsepower and 625 lb/ft of torque straight off the assembly line. A Tremec 7-speed dual-clutch transmission transfers pavement-pounding power to the ground by twisting a 3.73 Torsen limited-slip rear-axle. <a href="https://tri-industries.tapkat.org/wina2020fordshelbygt500?promo=MOTOR1">The car is</a> also equipped with an Active Valve Performance dual exhaust with quad tips, a MagneRide damping system, adjustable top strut mounts, and five different drive modes to choose from. Also, the car features oil, transmission and differential coolers. Stopping the insane amount of power is not an issue thanks to massive red-painted Brembo brakes, with 6-piston calipers up front and 4-piston calipers out back.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, <a href="https://tri-industries.tapkat.org/wina2020fordshelbygt500?promo=MOTOR1">the 2020 Shelby GT500</a> is a powerhouse that is a force to be reckoned with on and off the track. Full of raw power, the car can sprint from 0 to 60 in a lightning-quick 3.3 seconds and can reach 100-mph in 10.6 seconds. Filled to the brim with technology, advanced control systems allow for distinct drive modes (such as track and drag mode) to get the maximum performance out of the powertrain and chassis. </p>
<p>Inside the cockpit, features include leather-trimmed Recaro sport seats (part of the Carbon Fiber Track Pack package) and a 12-inch LCD digital instrument cluster. Interior technology includes Sync 3, Sirius radio, and FordPass Connect. Even more, the car has electric line-lock, launch control, and track apps. Other interior goodies include a rear seat delete and an exposed carbon fiber instrument panel. This Shelby GT500 comes with the Technology Package that features a B&OÂ® sound system by Bang & Olufsen that includes 12 speakers and subwoofers, a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system that includes SiriusXM Traffic and TravelLink, heated exterior mirrors, and BLIS (Blind Spot Info System) with cross-traffic alert.</p>
