<p>If you look up values for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/watch-is-this-the-ultimate-car-club/">BMW</a> 507, which was made from 1956 to 1960, you might be shocked to find them well into the seven digits. Examples in perfect condition all around can go for northwards of $2 million. In fact, one 507 sold for over $5 million, setting a record for the most expensive <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/one-owner-1987-bmw-e23-l7/">BMW</a> sold. What’s even more interesting is the 507 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bmw-group-launches/">almost killed BMW</a> in the late 50s. It’s an interesting story of how this little <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/sports/">sports car</a> went from a complete dog <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-bmw-collection-will-make-you-jealous/">to a collector’s dream</a>.</p>

<p>Max Hoffman, an American importer of European luxury and sports cars, is the one who receives credit for dreaming up the BMW 507. It would undercut the expensive <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-isnt-just-another-mercedes-300sl/">Mercedes 300SL</a> while at the same time outperforming the more accessible Triumphs and other roadsters from Britain which had become wildly popular in the US. Hoffman believed there was a niche between those two market positions and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/pcarmarket-presents-m-madness/">BMW</a> agreed.</p>

<p>Designed by Albrecht Goertz, the 507 used the same chassis and 3.2-liter aluminum alloy V8 as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1983-bmw-320is-boasts-low-milage/">BMW</a> 502. With a peak 155-horsepower and ZF four-speed manual transmission, plus reasonably good handling, the 507 promised a lot of fun on the road. Plus, you could get a detachable hardtop instead of opting for the soft top.</p>

<p>Originally, Hoffman envisioned <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1974-bmw-2002-turbo/">BMW</a> cranking out 5,500 of these cars a year. Considering <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tupac-death-bmw-for-sale/">BMW</a> was not too far off from a boutique automaker in the 1950s that was a lofty idea. With that kind of sales volume, he calculated the 507 could be sold at a competitive $5,000. When the rubber hit the road, the sales price was closer to $10,500 thanks to extensive handcrafting and bespoke treatments. Most car shoppers couldn’t stomach that, so during the production run a mere 252 BMW 507s were made.</p>

<p>Not everyone found that price to be out of reach, with politicians and celebrities favoring the little German roadster, including <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/elvis-presley-driven-ford-roadster/">Elvis Presley</a> who at one point owned two. However, their praise for the car wasn’t enough to keep the steep production costs from almost financially sinking BMW as a company.</p>
<p>As you know, rarity and kind memories of a classic car will make values skyrocket. That’s precisely the case with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/bmw-328d-sports-wagon/">BMW</a> 507 which is arguably the most collectible BMW today, even though it was a complete flop during its production run.</p>
