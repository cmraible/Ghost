The question we have is if Lamborghini had stuck with a design like this would the Countach have had the huge fan following it enjoyed? Would rambunctious little boys in the 80s have gotten as excited over it as they did GI Joe and Transformers? Would the Italian been featured in all kinds of movies and TV shows? Or was the busy design assaulting enough to get it noticed at a time when that’s what people wanted? You tell us!"
