While there’s no way to verify with certainty this motorcycle is indeed a barn find, the condition certainly seems consistent with such treatment. What’s more, the parts on the Chief all appear to be original, and that’s that key. Plus, under the coating of barn dust is what certainly appears to be the factory paint."

At the moment, Hagerty pegs a 1948 Indian Chief concours value at $32,400. In other words, expect the bidding for this bike to get pretty fierce toward the end."
