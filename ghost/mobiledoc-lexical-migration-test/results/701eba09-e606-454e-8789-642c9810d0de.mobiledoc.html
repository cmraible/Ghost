At the CFPB, agency alumni will not get special treatment. In fact, it will be just the opposite. We will be applying heightened scrutiny to matters and decisions where a party has employed or retained the services of a former employee to ensure that the CFPB is meeting the highest standards of ethics and integrity implemented nearly a decade ago,” the agency said in a statement on the new guidelines.</em></p>

The package also contains a number of narrower proposals meant to shore up long-standing parts of the social safety net, like coverage for hearing needs in Medicare and a program to cover the Medicaid gap, partly paid for by allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices,” </em>The Intercept<em> reports.</em></p>
