According to the listing, this car is in solid running order and appears to be in largely original condition. Given a repaint a few years back, the beautiful white finish shows in fantastic shape, and the canvas top that covers the cabin looks brand new. All brightwork on the car looks to be original and is also in great condition. Also believed to be original to the car is the leather upholstery found inside which also shows to be spectacularly well-maintained throughout its lifetime."

The car makes 150-brake-horsepower at 5,200 rpm. Thanks to a 4-wheel independent suspension, this car has incredible road manners with handling staying in check. Bringing everything to a halt are disc brakes on all four corners. Allowing for fantastic drivability is the addition of fuel injection that feeds the engine."
