<p>As Porsche’s first foray into the world of production cars, the 356 stands as Genesis to many attributes that today we perhaps take for granted.</p>
<p>Back in the 1950s, cars weren’t designed like this. The 356 was totally unique, with a rear engined, air cooled setup. Ferry Porsche set out to build a car <em>he</em> wanted, as his desire simply didn’t exist. The car he built was the first stepping stone of many to create one of the most iconic brands in our automotive history.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, the 356 fitted one particular bill; a car you could win races with on Sunday and drive to work on Monday. Yet the car offered here, by <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=18835?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Vicari Auctions</a>, isn’t actually an original as the looks may suggest.</p>
<p>Porsche 356’s have built up an incredibly large aftermarket network that has seen multiple companies build replicas once values began to leave the Earth’s atmosphere. Despite being unsure of this particular example's origins, we are told that it was built at the end of the 1990s by a seasoned mechanic and builder.</p>

<p>Judging by the rather insane collection of accolades to its name, we are adamant this has to be one of the best out there. Not many 356s, replicas or not, are likely to be the proud owner of over 100 trophies.</p>
<p>The car sits on chromed, Lotus-style wheels with spinlock style caps for added flair. Standard fit items like the chrome front and rear bumpers have been removed too, creating a cleaner line. Photographs continue on the underside of the beast, and unanimously confirm why the trophy cabinet is so full.</p>
<p>As one of those cars that were built with nothing it didn’t need, but everything it did, this is surely the most affordable way into an engineering philosophy that may never be recreated.</p>
