          "The styling dramatically changed for the seventh generation, becoming more angular and aggressive overall, and adopting some styling cues from the 1968-1970 Chargers. A Pentastar 3.6-liter would take duty in the base models in 2011. The 2012-2018 years would welcome the Super Bee platform, which was later changed to the wildly popular Scat Pack, using retro badging and offering better performance."

          "In 2015, the Charger was significantly changed and gained a more dynamic look. All models except the Charger Pursuit came with an 8-speed automatic. 2015 was also the year the extremely popular Charger Hellcat with supercharged 6.2-liter would make its debut. A widebody was introduced in 2020 to allow for a better tire/suspension package, the Redeye was also introduced for 2020."

The rarest Charger made was the Charger 500, with only 503 models made for the single year model edition. With production irregularities in recent years, the Charger had low sales of 77,426 in 2020 and only 42,103 until made for 2021."
