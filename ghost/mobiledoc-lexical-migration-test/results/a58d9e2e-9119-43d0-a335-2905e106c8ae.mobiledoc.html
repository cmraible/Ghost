<hr>
<p>For the second time this year, Ford has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-chops-mach-e/">cut prices for the Mach-E</a>, an all-electric crossover that’s allegedly a Mustang somehow. This seems to be in response to Tesla cutting its prices again, the same as early in 2023. Shoppers <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/mach-e-buyers/">who actually want</a> a Mach-E can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mach-e-profits/">expect to save</a> between $1,000 to $4,000 on the bloated pony. And you can serve shrimp or hot wings from the frunk for a food poisoning good time.</p>

<p>What’s truly interesting about this strategy, which obviously is a play to capture or at least maintain market share, is that Ford loses a substantial sum with each Mach-E sold. Ford keeps losing billions on its electric vehicles, but seems to think it will turn a corner as it transitions the whole company to EVs.</p>

<p>The biggest price reductions are for the Mach-E Premium RWD Standard Range, Premium AWD Standard Range, and GT AWD Extended Range, all reduced $4,000.  Both the Select RWD Standard Range and Select AWD Standard Range have been cut by $3,000. For the California Route 1 AWD Extended Range and GT Performance Edition Package, prices have been cut by $1,000. Try to not hyperventilate and go straight to your Ford dealer to take advantage of these amazing deals.</p>
<p>This means for those who want to take the plunge into Ford’s electric future can do so for between $42,995 and $59,995. Stop and think what you would’ve thought of those prices 10 years ago, even just 5 years ago. Yikes.</p>

<p>Back in January, Ford slashed Mach-E prices from $600 to $5,900 to try staying competitive with Tesla. A lot of people looking at the Model Y also consider the fat pony crossover, helping to blow up claims that it’s really hardcore Mustang enthusiasts who are interested in it. While there are probably a few traditional Mustang owners who have also purchased a Mach-E, it’s far more popular with those who love have the shiny new thing to show off to the neighbors.</p>
