Unlike the Bullitt hero car, though, this Mustang is powered by a 351W V8 (instead of the GT's 390 CID V8), but it does have some upgrades like a serpentine belt system and aluminum heads. While McQueen's Mustang had a four-speed manual, this car lets the driver shift through a five-speed Tremec manual transmission with an aluminum driveshaft."

It is also equipped with the Magne-Ride Damping System to make sure this Mustang handles as good as it looks."

          ", Ford only made 5,582 of these in total, but only 1,819 were  painted in Black (the signature Dark Highland Green and True Blue were also available colors that year). These Bullitt Mustangs received some engine tweaks to the 4.6-liter V8 for better air flow and power, which helped squeeze an extra 5 horsepower from the engine giving the Bullitt 265 horsepower, as well as specially tuned suspension that was firmer and lowered for a cooler look and better handling."
