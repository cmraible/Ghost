The fact is the automaker already trimmed back its offerings, so it doesn’t have much more fat to shed during these incredibly difficult times. While some competitors have just taken the hit on cars which carry thin profit margins or are slow sellers, Ford has been forced to trim into its muscle."

          "As the CNBC report pointed out, CEO Jim Farley told investors Ford was expecting a 50% cut of vehicle production for the second quarter of this year. Sadly, that’s still a 17% increase over production in the first quarter. COVID-19 shutdowns and the shortage of microchips as well as other vehicle components have taken a serious toll on the auto industry. Ford estimates by the close of the year, its financial losses from the chip shortage will total about $2.5 billion. It looks like we’re far from out of the woods when it comes to this mess, which is estimated to stretch into 2022."
