This is according to an anonymous source from The Telegraph, so take it with a grain of salt. Actually, we think most of our readers won't really care all that much. Also, CNN reports the car set the extremely wealthy couple back a cool $25 million, which might set a record as the most expensive new vehicle. Either way, that's a ridiculous price, but we hope Jay-Z and Beyonce perform a song together about going picnicking in their Rolls. "
