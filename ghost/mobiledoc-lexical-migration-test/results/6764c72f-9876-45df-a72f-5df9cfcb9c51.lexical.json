Eight years later, the Corvette convertible acted as the pace car, and while the official pace car was yellow, all 1986 Corvette convertibles (7,315 in all) were considered pace cars even though many didn't have the decals installed. The 1995 and 1998 pace cars were produced in far lower numbers (527 and 1,100, respectively) making these versions more collectible.",

It was until 2007 that Chevy offered pace car replicas again when it produced 500 examples – all convertibles – that year. In 2008, there were actually two Corvettes acting as the official pace car – a custom Z06 made to run E85 gas and a black and silver version to commemorate 30 years since the 1978 pace car – with 500 production replicas of the latter being signed by Emerson Fittipaldi.",
