<hr>
<p>Say the name "<a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Jeep Cherokee</a>," and most folks will think about the boxy '84-'01 XJ platform Jeeps. They have a legendary reputation among off-roaders that has made the modern crossover that bears the name all but forgettable.</p>
<p>However, there's <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">yet another Cherokee</a> that <em>doesn't</em> deserve to be forgotten. From 1974 to 1983, you could buy a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ls-swapped-jeep-cherokee-is-a-powerful-suv-for-true-car-people/">Cherokee</a> that shared the SJ platform and its styling with the beloved Wagoneer.</p>

<p>The SJ Cherokee was basically a two-door Wagoneer. <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The 1979 example seen here</a> looks terrific in pale yellow over brown. It's powered by a 401 cubic inch AMC V8 backed up by a three speed automatic transmission.</p>
<p>The Brooks Stevens styling is attractive, yet <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">simple and utilitarian</a>. It's considered timeless by many â€“ quite ironic, considering that Stevens is credited with inventing the term <em>planned obsolescence</em> (but not the concept thereof). </p>

<p>The styling isn't the only timeless part of <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the SJ Cherokee's design</a>. These trucks have an impressive reputation for reliability that's hard-earned and well-deserved.</p>
<p>If these trucks have a weakness, it's that they are prone to rust. Water, dirt, and road salt tends to get into places it shouldn't, and rust these Jeeps from the inside out. It's a well-known Achilles heel of <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the design</a>.</p>

<p>That makes the condition if <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5847/1979-jeep-cherokee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this beautiful 1979 Cherokee</a> even more impressive. SJ <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1968-tonka-jeep-gets-fully-restored-2/">Jeeps</a> are in high demand, and buyers are willing to pay a premium to won the nicest examples they can find.</p>
<p>We've seen nice Grand Wagoneers sell for well over $50,000 and beyond. That makes this Cherokee a bargain at just $19,900. It's a sportier SJ, and one we'd be proud to call our own.
