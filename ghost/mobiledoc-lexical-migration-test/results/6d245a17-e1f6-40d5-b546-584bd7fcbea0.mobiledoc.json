Not only are the exterior and interior details correct, the convertible top has been replaced so you have that added protection in case anything unforeseen pops up. Even better, a black removable hardtop is included."

All the factory instruments have been refurbished, so you get the look and feel of the original car but without dead gauges. The black vinyl upholstery is new and Dynamat sound deadening material was installed underneath the fresh carpeting. The factory steering wheel has been mounted onto a telescoping column for added convenience."
