The original 400ci V8 wasn’t in good condition wasn’t they tore into it in the video, so the decision was made to go with a 460ci V8 generously donated by a 1996 Ford F-350. We think it’s a wise choice since it not only puts more power on tap but should be a reliable engine (once it’s rebuilt, that is). The guy still saved the original engine and maybe one day he’ll tear into it, fix everything wrong, and throw it in something else. Waste not, want not!"
