It's awesome to see such a rare automobile showing off its style but that certainly isn't the only part of the body that makes it attractive. Gold has always been a hit or miss color with cars but for some reason, on Pontiacs, it makes these cars incredibly iconic. This particular paint code is called Quezal Gold and is probably the most noticeable piece of the puzzle. "

Connected to that is a four-speed manual transmission, a very sought-after option for the time as automatics sort of sucked at that time. We live in a very interesting time as our modern sports cars, made between the late ‘90s up to today, are sort of the first ones to consistently beat classic muscle cars like this stock for stock. Even still, the manufacturer originally built the car for drag racing, something this car likely excels at."
