Then again, how could we not with so many Mustangs out there and plenty of enthusiasts to customize them to their liking? For example, you might take this particular Mustang which, among other things, stuns us with its police-spec engine and great looks. Of course, this is no ordinary Ford but rather a Shelby creation which is yet another reason to get excited about the vintage beast."

All of you car people, like myself, will know the name GT500 very well for this point and will also be excited to learn that this is an example of just that. Under the hood is a Paxton supercharged V8 engine, one of just 33 GT350s made this way. Today it can be easy to think of that as not being extremely impressive but in 1967 that was virtually unheard of in a production car. Of course, the party doesn't stop at the flywheel either as the Shelby brand is dedicated to the pursuit of performance and a great driving experience."
