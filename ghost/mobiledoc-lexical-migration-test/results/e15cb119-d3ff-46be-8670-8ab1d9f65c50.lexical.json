Under the hood originally sat a 3.0-liter engine which proved very useful on the racing track. It might not have made a ton of power but the rest of the car made up for its output with an extremely light body, chassis, and stirpped-dow interior. This particular vehicle is a great example of exactly what made them so popular in the first place, and it's in really good condition.",
