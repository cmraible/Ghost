<hr>
<p>For a lot of enthusiasts, a largely factory-original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-camaro-ss-found-grass/">1969 Chevy Camaro</a> would be a dream car. However, Sean Smith Design doesn’t do commissions for average folk, having worked with the likes of Ringbrothers, Speedkore, and Saleen on high-end projects. That helps explain why this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/younger-gearheads-restomod/">restomod</a> wears not only an unbelievably smooth body but the Silver with Liquid Champagne paint job with Stain Charcoal Grey accents is something one normally wouldn’t expect on a muscle car.</p>

<p>That’s right, this ’69 is most likely out of your buying power. However, the lucky owner will be getting more than just a pretty face. Housed under that silky smooth hood is a supercharged 7.0-liter LS V8. Tuned by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-chevy-camaro-ringbrothers/">Wegner Motorsports</a>, the engine produces a pulse-pounding 1,180-horsepower.</p>

<p>These days, a mill so perfect is often ruined by the transmission choice. However, Fenix sticks the landing with a 6-speed Tremec. Providing the appropriate rigidity for all that power is a Roadster Shop Fast Track chassis. Up front is an RS Fast Track suspension with spindle and hub assemblies donated by a C7 Corvette.</p>

<p>To keep things even tighter, there’s a 1/25-inch splined front sway bar with end links also donated by a C7. What’s more, the frame is fabricated out of 10-gauge boxed steel. Baer six-piston pistons and 14-inch rotors from Baer ensure solid braking power.</p>

<p>As a true restomod, the Fenix Camaro comes with quite the opulent interior. Drawing obvious inspiration from European vehicles, it features a custom dash, door panels, and center console. Charcoal Grey and Crème leather adds a level of sophistication that might not square with the blue collar origins of the Camaro, but this client obviously wanted that strange marriage.</p>
