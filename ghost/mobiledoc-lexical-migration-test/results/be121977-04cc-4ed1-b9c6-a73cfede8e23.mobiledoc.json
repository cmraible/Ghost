          "Back in the summer of 2019 Ford wowed enthusiasts when it revealed the Predator, a 760-hp supercharged 5.2-liter V8. It was the most powerful engine used in a street-legal Ford to date. Immediately, comparisons between it and the Dodge Hellcat flared up with the Blue Oval faithful rejoicing in its arrival. Well, a lot of has changed since then, including Mopar offering the Hellcat crate engine and now Ford’s following suite with the Predator crate engine."

However, keep in mind MSRP for the Hellcat crate engine (the Hellcrate for all you pedantry types) is just $19,530. In other words, the Predator is pricey for what you get. However, if you’re a died-in the-wool Ford fan it might be worth it just to stick it to the Mopar crowd."
