The early battles are tough but as you grow, your party of figments and the various battle possibilities really open up and you’ll soon find yourself doing some pretty bad-ass attacks on the many ghostly enemies that you come across. Each enemy also has a stun bar which increases with every hit and when filled, the enemy is unable to attack. This becomes the focus of most of the battles because getting an extra turn over your foes is, of course, invaluable. I normally find the battles in turn-based RPGs pretty dull but I actually enjoyed them in "
