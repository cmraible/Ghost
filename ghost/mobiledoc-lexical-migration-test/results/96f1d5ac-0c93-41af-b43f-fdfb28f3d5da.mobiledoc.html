<p>Good things are happening! All over the country and beyond, ordinary people are organizing in their communities and workplaces, holding politicians accountable, and winning.</p>
<p>In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka (D) has unveiled an aggressive housing plan to take on big investors scooping up properties. Workers at Target in Virginia, meanwhile, have filed for a union election, and the EPA has proposed an important new asbestos disclosure rule. On top of that, friend of <em>The Lever</em> Matt Bruenig has put together some awesome new Starbucks union organizing data.</p>

<p>On May 4, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka announced that he would take aggressive action against investors scooping up homes and driving up the cost of living.</p>
<p>Baraka, who was elected in 2014 with the support of the city’s progressive movement, was inspired to do so by a new report by Rutgers law professor David Troutt entitled, “Who Owns Newark?”<em></em>The report <a href="https://www.clime.rutgers.edu/publications-filtered/who-owns-newark">found</a> that, in Newark, “almost half of all real estate sales were made by institutional buyers.”</p>
<p>“In cities and even suburbs across America, institutional investors are eroding the American dream of homeownership as they convert owner-occupied homes into corporately owned rental units,” Baraka <a href="https://abc7ny.com/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-corporations-buying-homes-real-estate/11817402/">said</a> when he announced the policy last week. “In Newark, where we have worked hard for years to expand homeownership, we will do everything possible to combat this dangerous trend.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Baraka pledged to support municipal legislation that would crack down on aggressive solicitation, bring more transparency to the limited liability companies purchasing the real estate, and raise fees on landlords who increased rent above five percent and put the extra revenue into an affordable housing trust fund.</p>
<p>Kudos to Baraka for stepping up. If only more mayors would follow his lead.</p>

<p>Across the nation, the labor movement continues to grow! In Christiansen, Virginia, workers at a Target filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday, citing poor treatment and low wages as their reason for organizing. “I just saw how Target was treating me and all the other workers,” one worker <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/166412/target-union-virginia-nlrb-amazon-starbucks">told</a><em>The New Republic</em>. “Seeing how little they’re paying compared to the amount of work they give us; the ridiculous expectations.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers at Cannabis Nation, a marijuana dispensary in Oregon, are striking for union rights and <a href="https://twitter.com/ufcw555/status/1525138151009681408">safety</a> on the job.</p>
<p>Curious about the extent of Starbucks workers’ unionization efforts? Matt Bruenig, who runs the People's Policy Project, ran the numbers and found that Starbucks Workers United, with their current win rate, is <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/05/11/the-rapidly-growing-starbucks-union-in-numbers/">on track</a> to have 6,400 unionized members at 230 stores across the country. Just on Friday, workers won two more union election efforts at stores in California.</p>

<p>The EPA has finally proposed a rule to be much more stringent on asbestos disclosure. That’s important, as over <a href="https://www.asbestos.com/asbestos/statistics-facts/#:~:text=Asbestos%20Facts%20%26%20Statistics-,Asbestos%20Facts%20%26%20Statistics,asbestos%2Drelated%20disease%20every%20year.">39,000</a> Americans die from asbestos every year.</p>
<p>According to the Mesothelioma Center, which tracks changes to asbestos regulation, “The rule would require companies that manufacture or process <a href="https://www.asbestos.com/products/">asbestos-containing products</a> to report all types of use, quantities of use and exposure-related information, much of which is not currently required.” This comes on top of a recent proposed EPA <a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/22450-epa-proposes-landmark-ban-on-asbestos">ban</a> of all chrysotile asbestos, the only kind of asbestos still imported to the U.S. In a press release, the EPA said that the two rules were part of a “comprehensive suite of actions to address the risks to public health from asbestos.”</p>
<h3 id="colorado-lawmakers-notch-environmental-victories">Colorado Lawmakers Notch Environmental Victories</h3>
<p>Friend of <em>The Lever </em>Chase Woodruff <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/05/11/climate-environmental-bills-survive-legislative-gauntlet-at-sessions-end/">reports</a> for <em>Colorado Newsline</em> that Democratic lawmakers in the state just pushed through a suite of pivotal environmental laws, as time was ticking on their legislative session.</p>
<p>As Woodruff noted, “Democratic-backed legislation to <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/05/09/time-running-out-for-must-pass-air-pollution-bill-opposed-by-business-groups/">better regulate toxic air pollution</a>, <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/04/15/low-recycling-rate-producer-responsibility-fees/">improve Colorado’s dismal recycling rates</a> and <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2020/07/24/colorados-buildings-are-a-6-billion-square-foot-climate-change-problem/">reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings</a> all won approval from lawmakers and are headed to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk, overcoming the <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/gop-escalates-delay-tactics-with-two-days-and-dozens-of-democratic-bills-left-at-colorado-legislature/">Republican stall tactics</a> that marked the session’s end.”</p>
<p>According to Woodruff, Colorado lawmakers also “passed a pair of bills that would create a <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-193">$65 million grant program</a> to help school districts purchase electric buses and a <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-180">$28 million pilot program</a> for fare-free public transit during the summer ozone season. Both were part of a <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/03/31/e-bikes-electric-school-buses-eyed-air-quality-ozone/">package of bills touted by Democrats</a> as ways to improve regional air quality after hazardous smog dramatically worsened along the Front Range in 2021.”</p>
