<p>With increasing interest in 90s Japanese performance vehicles, more people are rescuing barn find condition cars from brands like Nissan, Toyota, and Mitsubishi. This might seem humorous to enthusiasts who <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-rocket-bunny-nissan-silvia-s14-looks-a-little-mopar/">feel allegiance to the Big Three</a>, but as we’ve seen in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1967-toyota-2000gt-auctions/">some recent auctions</a>, Japanese cars are becoming a force to be reckoned with. That’s why it’s satisfying to see this guy buy a barn find <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-nissan-240sx/">Nissan 240SX</a>, even if he frames the transaction as being motivated by pure boredom on his part.</p>
<p>Hey, rescuing and restoring old cars is a good way to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/kids-steal-cars/">spend your free time</a>. At least, we think it is, versus people who sit around and watch “reality” TV or do other wasteful things. Restoring a car is a productive, positive activity, plus it’s good to get your hands dirty, especially if you don’t have a day job which involves that.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the guy in the video claims this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/learn-how-fielding-shredder-made-it-to-netflixs-hyperdrive/">Nissan</a> has only been sitting for 2 years in a garage. Some areas are naturally dustier than others, but there’s a pretty good layer of the stuff. However, giving it a bath is only the start of the work necessary to bring this 240SX back to its glory days.</p>
<p>It looks like this car is running at least a few bolt-on mods, mainly an aftermarket air intake and breather. The big question is would you go through the trouble of finding and installing the factory equipment, or just keep it as is? This guy plans on dropping a turbo system in, so he’s definitely not at OEM purist.</p>
<p>We can thank the tuner craze of the late 90s and early 2000s for destroying many of the Nissan 240SXs out there. Quite a few were destroyed in horrific street racing incidents, while others were mangled in an effort to get attention on the road. That’s unfortunate, because while the old coupes weren’t the fastest car ever made, they sure were enjoyable and downright rewarding to drive in their pure form.</p>
