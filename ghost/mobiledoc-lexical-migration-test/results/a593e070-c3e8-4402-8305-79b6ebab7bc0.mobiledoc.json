          "The GT offers a level of practicality that the roadster can’t match, thanks to its hatchback configuration. And if you buy one with a Webasto sunroof you can still enjoy the wind in your hair. Meanwhile, if you buy a rubber-bumpered B you can convert it to chrome-bumper spec, but the costs of doing this and the car’s ultimate value probably ensures this isn’t worthwhile – you might as well just buy a chrome-bumper car to start with."

But if you’re keen to go touring – and the B makes an excellent long-distance tourer – you might prefer a car that’s got a few improvements for added comfort and reliability."
