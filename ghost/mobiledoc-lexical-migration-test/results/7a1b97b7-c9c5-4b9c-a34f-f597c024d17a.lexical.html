<p>There’s been loads of bitching in the Mac blogging world about the new version of iMovie that arrived with iLife ’08, because it lacked the fine-grained control over the editing. Well, I beg to differ. I was in rural Suffolk at the weekend, and attended the Halesworth Antiques Fair. I edited down the footage I shot and had it on YouTube in a matter of minutes:</p>
<p><object height="350" width="425">
        <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nLFTrN6hlwY">
        <param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nLFTrN6hlwY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent">
    </object></p>
<p>And that’s a good thing to me. The point of most (but not all) web video is speed, rather than high-quality results. So yay Apple for iMovie ’08, and be prepared for more video from me..</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
