The Charger 500 didn't do well in competition, though, and only 392 were ever built making them even rarer than the iconic Charger Daytona. "

The bullet-shaped nose and cartoonishly large rear wing helped Dodge dominate the racing circuit, but only 503 were ever made for the car's single model year. This Charger Daytona looks like it's still ready for the track with its steel wheels and Goodyear Eagle tires."
