          "Chip Ganassi Racing won its first race in 1994 with the Target-sponsored Reynard 94I-Ford-Cosworth XB, and this livery was also present when Dario Franchitti won the 2010 Indianapolis 500 in a Dallara IR-05. The Dallara DW12 helped Scott Dixon win three races and the 2018 IndyCar championship, and a cutaway version of this car will also be on display. For endurance cars, there are the Ford- and Lexus-powered Riley prototype racecars as well as the no. 68 Ford GT that finished first in the LM GTE Pro class at the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans – 50 years after Ford’s iconic podium sweep in 1966. Chip Ganassi Racing has had plenty of success in NASCAR racing, too, including the no. 40 Dodge Intrepid driven by Sterling Marlin, the no. 1 Chevrolet Impala driven by Jamie McMurray and the no. 42  Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 driven by Kurt Busch."
