On the outside, this car looks sinister in all black with the bright red brake calipers, and opening the door reveals an interior covered in Adrenaline Red leather decked out in the Corvette's top 3LT trim level. There's no price listed for this C8, but it will likely cost more than the orange Corvette below to bring this bad boy home."

Starting with the 2LT trim level, this Corvette adds plenty of options like the performance data recorder, navigation, Carbon Flash aluminum wheels and the performance exhaust system that bumps the engine's output up to 495 horsepower. To go along with all of its added equipment and the car's overall rarity, this C8 2LT Z51 is priced at $115,328."
