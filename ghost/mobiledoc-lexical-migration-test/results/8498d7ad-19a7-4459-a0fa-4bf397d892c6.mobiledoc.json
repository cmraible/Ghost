          "This increased power is sent to wider rear tires, and to accommodate the 11-inch wide rear wheels, the ZR-1's width increases from the front doors rearward; at the rear bumper, the ZR-1 is about four inches wider than a stock C4 Corvette. Aside from the ZR-1 badges, the easiest visual cues to spot a ZR-1 are the rear lights. Earlier models introduced the rounded rear end with taillights that were more squared off, but even when the standard Corvette upgraded to this style, the ZR-1's third brake light remained on the roof rather than incorporated into the body."

          "Of course, these are just the obvious differences that make the ZR-1 special. Mirrock Corvette goes into fine details that separate the ZR-1 from the standard C4 Corvette including information about the ZR-1's exclusive vacuum pump, smog pump, wiring harnesses and even bumper brackets. If you are in the market for a C4 Corvette ZR-1 (or you just want to immerse yourself in the minute details of this legendary 'Vette), then be sure to check this video out."
