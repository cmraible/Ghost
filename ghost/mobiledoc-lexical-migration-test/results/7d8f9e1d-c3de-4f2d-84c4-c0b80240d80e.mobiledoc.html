These cars are more than worthy of a new garage, and we're thrilled to be able to share our picks with the readers each week. Here is a list of cars to check out as we roll into the first weekend of October.</p>

<p>Up until 1976, full tube frame cars were not allowed to compete in the IMSA North American <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/restored-1985-march-85g-gtp-acecar/">Road Racing</a> series. It was that year that the International Motor Sports Associations sanctioning body made a decision that completely changed the course for the series. With the new rules came more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/motorious-out-ranks-competition/">competition</a> for the racers that had up until that point dominated the track.</p>
