To meet the needs of the military, this truck was built in a wide variety of body styles, and this four-door body might be the coolest of them all with its rounded door openings, two rows of seating and a removable top and doors. Those huge, flat fenders are easy to see the resemblance to the Power Wagon, which went into production after the war."
