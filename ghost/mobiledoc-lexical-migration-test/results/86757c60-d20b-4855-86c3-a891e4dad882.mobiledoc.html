<p>Good things are happening! For starters, the Congressional Progressive Caucus has embraced Supreme Court packing. Furthermore, a famous D.C. bookstore became the first in the nation’s capital to unionize, and families of veterans who died of COVID in nursing homes have secured a historic settlement. Finally, the country is going green — even in coal states!</p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.pionline.com/pension-funds/new-york-state-common-wants-political-spending-info"><strong>New York Common Retirement Fund Wants Greater Transparency</strong></a><strong></strong>(Pensions & Investments) — <em>“New York State Common Retirement Fund, Albany, filed shareholder proposals with eight companies requesting that they comprehensively disclose political spending, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller and sole trustee of the $267.8 billion pension fund, announced Thursday. ‘The increased polarization of our political discourse and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol show just how risky it can be for companies to fund political agendas,’ Mr. DiNapoli said in a news release… Mr. DiNapoli has filed disclosure requests with Twitter Inc., DISH Network Corp., The Progressive Corp., Royal Caribbean Group, Las Vegas Sands Corp., Ulta Beauty Inc., VeriSign Inc., and Hanesbrands Inc.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/USProgressives/status/1478779866581458945?s=20"><strong>Progressive Caucus Endorses Court Packing</strong></a> (Twitter) — <em>The House Progressive Caucus membership has voted to support the Judiciary Act, which would add four justices to the Supreme Court. In a post on Twitter, the Progressive Caucus framed the vote as an effort to “restore balance” to the bench: ”Today's bench was filled by a partisan, right-wing effort to entrench an anti-democratic faction and erode human rights. It has gutted the Voting Rights Act and public sector unions, entrenched unconstitutional abortion bans, and failed to overturn the discriminatory Muslim Ban. As a co-equal governing body, Congress cannot sit by while this attack on the constitution continues unchecked. The urgent work to restore American democracy must include expanding the Supreme Court.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-or-reliability-ferc-blocks-northeast-gas-project/"><strong>Federal Regulators Block Northeast Natural Gas Project</strong></a><strong></strong>(EnergyWire) — <em>“The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission signed off on a plan from ISO New England Inc. to terminate its contract with the Killingly Energy Center, a 650-megawatt, gas-fired plant slated to be built in eastern Connecticut. ISO New England, which manages the power grid in six Northeast states, announced its intent to cancel the contract in November, citing project delays. First proposed in 2016, the power plant would have increased the available supply of electricity generated from gas in New England at a time when the region is facing fuel supply issues, according to developer NTE Energy LLC. But critics — including some state officials in Connecticut — have called the project counterproductive to efforts in the Constitution State and New England at large to transition to carbon-free electricity.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/nyregion/nj-nursing-home-covid-settlement.html"><strong>Families of Veterans Who Died of COVID in NJ Nursing Homes Win Historic Settlement</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“Now, in a sober acknowledgment of failings, New Jersey has agreed to pay $53 million to families of 119 veterans who lived in the two facilities. The families had been preparing to file lawsuits that accused the state of gross negligence. The average payout is expected to be roughly $445,000 as part of an out-of-court settlement that is believed to be the first of its kind nationwide.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://grist.org/energy/the-countrys-biggest-solar-farm-is-coming-to-one-of-the-coal-friendliest-states/"><strong>Coal-Loving Indiana To Construct the County's Largest Solar Farm</strong></a><strong></strong>(Grist) — <em>“Among vast fields of corn and soybeans in rural northwest Indiana, construction workers broke ground in October on what will be the largest solar farm in the United States. The project, known as Mammoth Solar, will cover 13,000 acres, spread across two counties, with 60 landowners involved. It will generate enough electricity to power nearly a quarter-million homes in an area with deep ties to the fossil fuel industry… After decades of reliance on coal, Indiana’s power system was poised for a change, largely due to aging infrastructure and economics. Four of the state’s electric utilities have announced plans to </em><a href="https://www.powermag.com/vectren-will-close-coal-units-add-renewables/"><em>close</em></a><em> their coal-fired plants soon. With the declining cost of solar, many utilities and developers have decided that construction of solar facilities is a better investment than new coal plants. Over the next two years, at least </em><a href="https://www.therepublic.com/2021/01/10/new_cash_crop_industrialsolarfarm_boom_hits_hoosier_backlash/"><em>15 solar projects</em></a><em> stretching 1,000 acres or more each are slated to go online in the state, in addition to several other smaller solar farms.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164800/jennifer-abruzzo-nlrb-enforce-biden-union-agenda"><strong>National Labor Relations Board Finally Doing Its Job</strong></a> (The New Republic) — <em>“In September, [NLRB general counsel Jennifer] Abruzzo laid down a marker on the controversial question of whether college sports players are employees. In a </em><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-jennifer-abruzzo-issues-memo-on-employee-status-of"><em>memo</em></a><em>, she argued they were, citing the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in NCAA v. Alston, which </em><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162831/ncaa-amateurism-higher-education-cost"><em>expanded</em></a><em> colleges’ ability to compensate athletes.…  Abruzzo is also recommitting the NLRB to protecting the right of immigrants to organize regardless of their immigration status — a </em><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/inside-bidens-push-to-protect-immigrant-workers-in-labor-probes"><em>low priority</em></a><em> under the Trump administration. In a November memo, she </em><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/general-counsel-jennifer-abruzzo-releases-memo-on-ensuring-rights-and"><em>ordered</em></a><em> NLRB officials not to collect Social Security or taxpayer identification numbers from witnesses giving affidavit testimony against an employer; that these witnesses be assured no inquiry will be made into their immigration status; and that when witnesses don’t wish to enter a federal building, affidavits should be taken in a ‘neutral’ setting.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/former-new-york-times-columnist-nick-kristof-ineligible-run-governor-oregon-secretary-state-says/"><strong>Former New York Times Columnist Ineligible To Run For Governor</strong></a> (Washington Post) — Occasionally, we get to laugh: <em>“Nicholas Kristof, a former </em>New York Times<em> columnist who in October announced a Democratic campaign for Oregon governor, is ineligible to run for the office, the Oregon secretary of state has announced, upending the journalist-turned-politician’s nascent campaign. In a statement Thursday, Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said her office was rejecting Kristof’s filing to run for governor because he does not meet the constitutional requirements to serve. She said a gubernatorial candidate must have been a ‘resident within this state’ for three years before the election.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/01/03/politics-and-prose-employees-celebrate-becoming-d-c-s-first-unionized-bookstore/"><strong>Politics and Prose Bookstore is Now Unionized</strong></a><strong></strong>(DCist) — <em>“The workers of Politics and Prose have successfully unionized, becoming the first bookstore in D.C. to do so. The UFCW Local 400 is now the collective bargaining agent for 54 employees across the three bookstore locations, according to organizing director Alan Hanson. The regional labor union is known for supporting retail workers and will represent the Politics and Prose staff. The owners, Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine, voluntarily recognized the union on Dec. 31 after refusing to for several weeks. Next, they and the union will have to negotiate a contract.” The move comes following public pressure. Last month, </em>New York Times<em> correspondent Peter Goodman </em><a href="https://twitter.com/petersgoodman"><em>spoke out</em></a><em> in solidarity with the workers before speaking at the bookstore.</em></p>

<h3 id="reader-comment-of-the-week">Reader Comment Of The Week:</h3>
<p>“Perhaps your finest post ever. Living in Michigan where the auto industry melted down leading to the 2008 financial disaster that revved up the auction industry and caused many to leave the state for other parts, the piece is a perfect description of what has been occurring. Today's <em>Detroit News</em> has an article indicating Macomb County was the source for a relatively large cluster of rioters — related or not. Working class has gone for Trump. More affluent Oakland County has gone Democratic. Both parties continue to support policies that lead to tax cuts for the rich and 26-percent annual gains in the stock market and support for right wing, anti-democratic governments bolstered by our financial and military institutions.” — <em>Alan Quellmalz on “</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-the-meltdown-became-an-insurrection/"><em>How the Meltdown Became An Insurrection</em></a><em>.”</em></p>
