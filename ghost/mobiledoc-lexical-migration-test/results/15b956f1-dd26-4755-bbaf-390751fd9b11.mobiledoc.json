It could have been a cooling fault. Or maybe it was faulty wiring – we honestly don’t know since no local reporting indicates that a cause was determined. No doubt the owner is getting to the bottom of what happened, but this accident also highlights the importance of proper maintenance of your vehicles, especially the electrical and fuel delivery systems. Failure to keep those in proper order can result in a sudden fire. We’re just glad this car was saved and nobody was hurt."
