<p>What happens when we build giant mech warriors to defend the planet and the world is now at peace? Why, we have them fight each other, of course! <em>Override 2: Super Mech League</em></p>

<p>Mech fighting games either go one of two ways: they either make the <em>Gundam</em>-inspired suits unrealistically agile or they attempt to replicate how rigid they would actually be. In the case of <em>Override 2</em>, it's the latter and it may take some time to get used to it. While it's a blast to feel all hulking and powerful, actions can take a while to implement. This sounds like a negative but in fact, it provides the game with strategic value where the player needs to determine whether they should go for blocking when they can see the opponent going on the offensive, execute quick attacks to when the timing is tight or unleash heavy attacks when the openings present themselves.</p>
<p>Combos also play a prominent role in the combat and pulling one off is marvelous. You can usually start off with simple attacks and turn it into a combo once you've gained the upper hand. And if you've built up the special bar meter and the timing is just right, your mech can unleash its <u><strong>Ultimate attack, which .</strong></u></p>
<p>The lock-on feature is rather frustrating and doesn't provide you with enough flexibility to use it to your advantage. Once locked onto an opponent, the camera will move so that they are always in the middle of your camera but when the game decides to take the liberty to lock onto an enemy on its own accord, it can send you careening off platforms and ruining your strategy.</p>

<p><em>Overriders 2</em> is primarily an online game where the online Quick Play option is above the Leagues (campaign) option in the home menu. There's even the ability to play through the League mode online with other players doing the same thing but luckily for those who don't like to play online or have less than favourable internet speeds, the option to fight against AI bots is also an option.</p>

<p>Each stadium arena has its own hazards and platform that make them unique if their own way. As the mechs can be quite rigid and slow, the fun that can be had with these are limited however, they do add strategical elements like moving platforms for quick getaways in order to regroup and objects to hide behind to take cover. Some levels also have objects that you can pick up and use as a weapon, as well as glowing areas that will increase your Ultimate meter. They're unique and add variety but with the mechs being so slow, I feel as though that potential is almost wasted.</p>
<h3 id="story-personality-15-10">Story / Personality 15 10</h3>
<p>The campaign begins with your faceless/nameless character as a newstarting rookie. Despite being a bit of a cliche, entering in as a rookie with little-to-no knowledge about the world mirrors the player's perspective coming into the game for the first time. It's a similar concept to characters having amnesia, they're supposed to learn about the world as you do. Therefore yes, a bit of a cliche but does it work? Absolutely!</p>
<h3 id="graphics-art-direction-20-14">Graphics / Art Direction 20 14</h3>
<p>The creativity of each level and mech is certainly an aspect to be highlighted and praised. Stages can range from volcanic pits to light and fluffy candy lands, as well as anything in between. Colour variety is wonderful and whilst it lacks in quality in handheld mode, docked mode is, for lack of a better word, passable.</p>
<p>As <em>Overriders 2</em> is also releasing on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, you know you're not going to be getting the best version of the game here. This is where the divide will slowly become more prominent as releasing a shiny, high budget action game shows just how much horsepower it's missing compared to the other consoles on the market. </p>

<p>You'll need to alter the audio settings if you want any hope of hearing what NPCs are saying. Whilst the music is, for lack of a better word, kickass, it definitely demands attention over subtleties and dialogue. That being said, when you can hear the dialogue, the voice acting is well executed and is surprisingly not cringey. It has a few hiccups here and there, especially when the voice actors seem to take some creative liberty and slightly deviate from the script but in essence, it has heart and the intention is exciting.</p>
