<p>The Dodge D100 pickup truck has long been a farm workhorse, construction worker’s best friend, and an asset to any active family. For decades these trucks hauled heavy loads, and today serve as a great American classic. This D100 up for auction with the <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/35024/1966-Dodge-D100/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Leake Auction Company</a> isn’t ready for an easy retirement just yet, as it has been reborn as a rat rod.</p>
<p>It’s certainly the most menacing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Dodge/">Dodge</a> truck we’ve seen in a while! This custom rat rod D100 is based on a 1966 example that ditches its traditional looks for this almost apocalyptic design. Naked metal has been polished to give the body an unpainted reflective quality that highlights some design traits previously masked by factory pastel colors. A contrasting gloss black finish for a hood stripe before covering the roof and filling the load bed. The truck’s typically ‘cute’ rounded headlights now also seem demonic, with a yellow lens at its center.</p>

<p>The custom interior is unrecognisable from the standard truck, now sporting a gothic theme. Quilted leather provides some stylistic detail in the otherwise spartan cabin that’s dominated by a pair of custom fabricated seats. Regardless of this Dodge’s transformation, a good size cargo area still makes this vehicle more practical than most.</p>

<p>Under the hood is a slant six-cylinder motor producing an unspecified amount of power, but sporting an aggressive crimson shade. Shifting is taken care of by an automatic transmission that gives life to the rear wheels. Custom air ride suspension allows this car to hunker down to the Tarmac to pose for its inevitable Instagram pictures. When crouched, the truck’s new Mobsteel wheels fill the arches and look menacing.</p>
<p>The Dodge D100 truck was introduced in 1961 and remained largely unchanged until it was replaced by the Ram in 1993.</p>
<p>This rat rod hits the auction block today, so you’ll need to be quick to place your bid!</p>
