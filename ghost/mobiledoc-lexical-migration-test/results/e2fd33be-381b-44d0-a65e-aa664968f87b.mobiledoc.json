After all, this car is heading towards the big 50 in just a handful of years, yet someone hasn’t been driving it all that much. It also doesn’t look like it was just stuck in a dusty barn and allowed to rot, but instead has been lovingly cared for while mostly sitting all this time."

That simple, vertical grille flanked by vertical stacked headlights combine with the iconic hood ornament to make a clear statement. A long, low body emphasizes this is a machine built for stylish comfort."

Plush bucket seats up front and a wide bench in the rear, plus plenty of legroom make this a car everyone likes taking out for a Sunday drive. Factory air conditioning is another great perk, as are the power windows. Even the original Becker AM/FM radio is still installed, so you can really take yourself back in time. Making all of that even more impressive is the fact the interior is original."
