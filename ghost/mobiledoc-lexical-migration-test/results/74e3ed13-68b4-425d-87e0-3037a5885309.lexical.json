The iconic round headlights that we all know and love today are what makes Porsche unique but in the world of racing they caused a pretty big problem, they were terrible for aerodynamics. To fix this issue Porsche began modifying their race cars to have slanted noses which were technically legal as the headlights were considered pieces of the fenders. This caused fans to go crazy for the opportunity to have a slant-nose Porsche of their own and many tuners were happy to give that to them. Possibly the most memorable of these was Gemballa, a Porsche tuner company that began recreating these beautiful racing vehicles.",
