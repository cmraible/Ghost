<p>When you first buy a Nintendo Switch, you may need a few accessories to go along with it. When I first bought a Switch back in March 2017, I ask ‘What Nintendo Switch accessories do I need?’. Well it’s been over two years since that day, so here are 30 Nintendo Switch accessories that make your Switch experience even better.</p>

        <p>It’s neat that the Switch has a built-in stand, but with that stand comes two problems: the first being that the stand only allows for a single angle of rotation and second, you cannot charge the console at the same time. The Adjustable Charging Standing fixes both of these issues, allowing you to tilt the screen to multiple different angles as well as allowing you to charge the device. Neat!</p>

        <p>It gets pretty boring sitting in the backseat of a car for hours on end, especially after the 50th round of I-spy. So to kill the time, the Nintendo Switch will definitely be coming out. But after hours of driving and the Nintendo Switch comes up with that dreaded warning saying that the console’s battery is almost depleted, you’re going to need a car charger to keep your gaming adventure going.</p>

        <p>With Nintendo’s recent focus on online due to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you may want to consider an ethernet adapter that will plug into a USB port in the side of the dock to ensure a stable connection. Especially when it comes to online fighting games (Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mortal Kombat 11, etc.), you want that connection to be as smooth as possible.</p>

        <p>The Flip Grip is quite a unique piece of plastic. The Nintendo Switch, with its unique design, allows vertical arcade games (both old and new) to be played as they were intended. The only issue is that when you rotate the Switch vertically, you’re either leaning it up, lying it down on a flat surface or balancing the screen on your legs. But with the Flip Grip, you can slide the Switch tablet into the it, attach the Joy-Cons and play your favourite arcade games safely and efficiently.</p>

        <p>Ever wish the left Joy-Con had a standard D-Pad? Well wish no more! HORI has made a handful of left sided Joy-Cons that brings back the traditional style of gaming. Not only are they practical, but they also come in some pretty stylish designs: Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario and Pikachu (my favourite is the Pikachu one, but that’s just me).</p>

        <p>This one is for all the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe fans out there. When Mario Kart Wii first came out and utilised the motion controls, the steering wheel was the perfect accessory to recreate the feeling of kart racing. With the Nintendo Switch doing away with the Wii Remotes and replacing them with the Joy-Cons, fans of the steering wheels can still play the way they like with the Joy-Cons. And besides, this way you can let everyone know online that you’re using motion controls…</p>

        <p>Sometimes I sit on my couch, Pro Controller in hand, my eyes drift away from the TV towards the Nintendo Switch dock and I think, “that looks so boring”. If you think the same way as I do, a PDP Light Up Dock Shield is something that might fix that. This officially licensed Pokemon Dock Shield switches between two different designs and 17 different colours so if your dock looks boring to you, just change the setting, sit back and enjoy.</p>

        <p>Those who have multiple TVs/monitors in their house but only one dock will know the pain of having to constantly unplug and replug their dock whenever they want to play on different screens. So to avoid having to do that, why not buy a second dock? Sure, the official dock can be a little pricey, but third party docks have been known to brick consoles, so it’s best to be safe than sorry.</p>

        <p>For all you Pokémon fans out there, the PokéBall Plus is a fantastic accessory to accompany your play through of Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu and Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee. Not only does the PokéBall Plus act as a controller, but you can also put a Pokémon inside it (not physically… just wanted to clarify), allowing you to walk around with it as it counts your steps and levels up said Pokémon. There are also plenty of accessories to go with it (sold separately), such as a charging stand to display your love for Pokémon.</p>

        <p>Third-party portable chargers and docks have been an issue with the Nintendo Switch, bricking the system and leaving the console nothing more than a shell of what it was. But sometimes we need to charge our Switch on the go, so we recommend the Anker PowerCore 20100, officially licensed by Nintendo themselves. Not only is this portable charger more reliable, but it can also hold a whopping 20100mAh of charge, leaving you with charge for hours of playtime on the go.</p>

        <p>The classic GameCube controller is beloved by many and despite its resurgence with the popularity of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the official controllers can be pricey and you have to buy an adapter to go with it. With the PowerA Wireless GameCube Controller, you can replicate the feeling of a GameCube controller with all of the additional buttons needed. The product is also officially licensed by Nintendo, so you know it’s good.</p>

        <p>The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is arguably the best controller that Nintendo has ever made. If you’re a seasoned gamer who likes to play on many different consoles, you might find the Joy-Con grip to be a little uncomfortable to hold for long play sessions. The Pro Controller, on the other hand, fits nicely into your hands and perfect for long stretches on time. The Pro Controller also comes in a few different designs, so you can take your pick.</p>

If you’re one who likes to buy their games physically, then having a few Super Mario Question Blocks laid out in front of your TV is both a perfect way to store all your games in one place and present your love for Nintendo games in style.</p>

        <p>We all love the Nintendo Switch; I wouldn’t be writing this and you wouldn’t be reading it, but we can all agree that 32GB internal memory is just not enough. Every Switch almost HAS to have a MicroSD card if you ever want to buy more than two games digitally. Luckily, MicroSD cards have DRAMATICALLY gone down in price and they come in a wide variety of sizes to fit your budget.</p>

        <p>A good pair of earphones are essential for gaming on the go… don’t be that guy on the train with the volume all the way up. The Turtle Beach Battle Buds are a fantastic option, with high quality 10mm speakers, customisation that allows you to find your perfect comfort and a detachable microphone that allows you to voice chat on the odd game that supports without the app.</p>
