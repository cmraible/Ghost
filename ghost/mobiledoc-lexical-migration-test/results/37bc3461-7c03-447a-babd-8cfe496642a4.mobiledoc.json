Although the Italian automaker won the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1960 through 1965, the GT40 broke the streak by taking home victory in 1966 for three consecutive races until 1969. Many car enthusiasts drool over a vintage Ford GT40, and Superformance has been building replica and continuation cars from the 1960s for decades starting in 1994. "
