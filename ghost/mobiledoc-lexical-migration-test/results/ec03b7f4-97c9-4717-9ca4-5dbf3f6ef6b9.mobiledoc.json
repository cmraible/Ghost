Detroit Trutrac axles were added to the front and rear, plus custom leaf packs were made and Fox shocks with remote reservoirs were added for all four corners. But wait, there’s more, because this truck has air shocks in the rear, also from Fox. That feature helps to balance things out when hauling or towing."
