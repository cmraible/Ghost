McLaren is one of those companies that really cares about his heritage, ignoring the fact that they’re currently selling off their classic car collection, and have made many miracles with hints to their older models. One such automobile that truly knocked it out of the park in terms of honoring an original masterpiece is the McLaren Elva. Being so unique and rare, you might not have ever heard of it but here’s a little rundown of what you might expect behind the wheel in this car.",

Out of the box, it came with whatever specifications the buyer of the car wanted making each Elva completely unique. That’s pretty crazy but it gets even weirder when you realize that only 149 of the cars were ever built. So, you get the gist, it’s an incredibly rare supercar built to pay homage to the legendary Bruce McLaren and his insanely well-built lineup of open top racers.",

Finally, power is set through a seven speed dual clutch seamless shift automatic transmission before eventually hitting the wheels and transferring its power to the ground.
