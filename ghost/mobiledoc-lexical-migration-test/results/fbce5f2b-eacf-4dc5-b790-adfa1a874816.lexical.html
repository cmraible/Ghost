<p>I can't quite believe it's Friday already. The first month of the year is traditionally quiet for me, but this year I've been caught between finishing up some courses and consultancy from last year, and pitching on some new (and necessary) new work for the year to come. Busy, busy, busy.</p>
<p>But not <em>too</em> busy to compile some useful reading for you to help you wind down towards the weekend…</p>

<h2 id="drawing-your-sources-into-a-story-circle">Drawing your sources into a Story Circle</h2>
<p>I missed this when it first appeared on the <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/blog/2020-01-10/taking-a-story-full-circle">Bureau of Investigative Journalism's blog</a> — but happily, my friends at journalism.co.uk have republished it. It's a remarkable case study of how they used the Story Circle idea to tell the story of people living on the edge in the UK, by drawing them into the reporting process.</p>
<p>A fascinating vision of how more reporting <em>could</em> be. </p>

<h2 id="de-trolling-twitter">De-trolling Twitter</h2>
<p>There's a whole bunch of changes on Twitter at the moment. I've been trying to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/01/twitter-updates/">track them all in one place</a>. This one's worth noting, though. It does feel like, after a moribund half-decade or so, Twitter is starting to push its product development forward again. </p>

<h3 id="youtube-makes-you-own-your-comments">YouTube makes you own your comments</h3>
<p>YouTube has notoriously failed to make any significant effort at all to improve its appalling comment sections. However, this is a step in the right direction. If you're trolling on one channel, that history will now follow you to any other channel where you chose to comment:</p>
