<p>Corvettes are arguably the definitive American sports car, and their popularity over the decades has spurred the model from one generation to the next. However, their popularity makes ownership far from exclusive, so fans of the avant-garde need look elsewhere. Or do they? <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/113711308898?autorefresh=true&ul_noapp=true">This unique Corvette</a> hatchback is one of just one.</p>
<p>Found on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/113711308898?autorefresh=true&ul_noapp=true" rel="noopener">Ebay</a>, this rather distressed looking Chevrolet Corvette might be written off by many, but it is, in fact, something rather special. Harry Bradley was a designer for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=GMC">General Motors</a> before being snapped up by Mattel to design 11 of 16 first edition Hot Wheels.</p>

<p>His flair for design lead him to explore the possibility of a more practical <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Corvette">Corvette</a>, but this wasn’t to be some sort of kit car project. "This Corvette Hatchback Coupe was designed and constructed to give the owner a vehicle that was as close to a factory prototype as possible. The intent was to develop a quality specialty vehicle, not another Corvette custom car,” said Bradley.</p>
<p>Not simply a case of creating a fastback rear for the car, the entire profile of the model has been changed to create a seamless design. A steel roll cage forms the rigid structure on which the sporting bodywork was applied.</p>
<p>However, rubber mounting cushions were also fitted to allow for the natural flexing of the bodywork in motion. This hatchback was conceived with all of the care and attention it would have in-house at GM.</p>

<p>The front end of the car received some bespoke treatment too with a new light bar arrangement. Possibly inspired by the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Citroen+SM">Citroën SM</a>, this cluster of lights provides a totally new look for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=C3+Corvette">C3 Corvette</a>. The car really does appear like a cohesive design, one that might have even made it to production in a parallel universe. Additional reengineering of the boot space, gas tank, rear lighting, and exhaust pipes were necessary but totally worth the effort.</p>
<p>This 350 Ci V8 car is numbers matching, however, an accident in 1997 has left the Corvette off the road ever since. It has been in storage for the past 20 years and isn’t drivable in its current state. However, this custom classic is well worth saving. The advert states: ‘Harry Bradley cars have won many awards and are displayed in museums and at car shows throughout the country.’</p>
<p>The asking price is $18,999 with the car’s owner being open to offers. It’s going to need some restoration work, but this one of a kind Corvette will be a showstopper once again when finished.
