<hr>
<p>If you’re interested in pre-war American motorcycles, three great examples are being auctioned off online right now. Two are Harley-Davidsons and one is an Indian, but all three boast a significant amount of historical import, making them ideal acquisitions for collectors or enthusiasts looking to beef up their motorcycle collection.</p>
<p><strong>Check out a 9-wheel Harley rig <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/harley-rig-amazing/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>The oldest one is a <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1926-Harley-Davidson-S-Pea-Shooter/lotInformation/75268380">1926 Harley-Davidson S “Pea Shooter.”</a> A true icon of the past, this motorcycle gets its name from the one-cylinder engine which pops as it runs. For a lot of people into the history of the company, this is a dream bike of sorts.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1941-Harley-Davidson-Knuckle-Head-EL/lotInformation/75268386">1941 Harley-Davidson Knucklehead EL</a>, which was manufactured right before the American company switched to its wartime production. Of course, the name “Knucklehead” comes from the hemi overhead valve engine with its famous bumps which attracted plenty of attention back in the day and still do. This particular bike features a suicide shifter, a fun detail for display or cruising around. The listing says the engine cranks, in case you plan on using this Harley for riding around town.</p>
