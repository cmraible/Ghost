While its graphics have aged well and the soundtrack is gorgeous, a messy, cumbersome battle system and long-winded story keep it from being a truly wonderful experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGzdeUCVWOE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ni no Kuni is fundamentally a JRPG with real-time battles, with the addition of a monster-taming mechanic. While battling, each of your party members can fight, or send out one of their familiars to fight instead, bringing more variety in attacks, spells and strategic play. I found the manoeuvrability during battles to be awkward and only useful if you need to gain some distance from an enemy in order to have time to heal. On the Switch, battles are made still more awkward by having to use the D-pad to select moves while needing to use the L/R buttons to switch familiars, and using the left analogue-stick to move, making for a very unintuitive control scheme that leaves very little time to focus on, or react to, events in battle. This also goes for the overworld gameplay, where you cannot intuitively use the analogue stick to navigate menus, but must use the D-pad.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_05-2.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11932\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_05-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_05-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_05-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_05-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the overworld play is just like any other traditional JRPG, I couldn’t help feeling that the whole experience was bloated. The price to pay for having expansive towns and fields to wander around in and show off the graphics is to make quests take three times as long to complete as the same quest would take in a much older game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Enjoying our Ni no Kuni Switch review so far?

I probably wasn’t supposed to be giggling when the kid’s mum died, but that’s probably more a reflection of my messed up sense of humour than of the game’s writing. I was giggling because &#8230; well, look. I realise having different types of cutscenes is common in JRPGs, but this was the first time I’d stopped to think about it. So there are three kinds of cutscenes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A.\nGhibli-animated and voiced</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B. 3D\nanimated and voiced</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C. 3D\nanimated with text boxes</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_02-2.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11930\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_02-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_02-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_02-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_02-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211;And\nthere is nothing more jarring than the sudden transition from beautiful, fluid\nhand-drawn animation (A) to the comparatively more rigid and lifeless 3D models\n(B or C), even as well made as they are in <em>Ni\nno Kuni</em>. And for some reason, they decided to hand-draw the scene before,\nand after, Oliver’s mum dies at the beginning of the game, but <em>not the scene where she actually dies</em>.\nAnd it’s really funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Wizard’s Compendium</em>, basically the fictionalized\nmanual for the game, might be my favourite thing in it. While I wished they had\nstuck to the faux-Early Modern English used in the book’s opening pages all the\nway through, I thoroughly enjoyed looking through all the different items and\ncreatures of the other world, and recognising them when I finally met them\nin-game.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Graphics / Art Direction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an\neight year-old game, Ni no Kuni demonstrates another victory for visual style\nover graphical power. The colourful, Ghibli-inspired landscapes, character\ndesigns and architecture show only slight signs of age and are never ugly;\nalthough, the character animations, especially the human NPCs, do often look a\nlittle dead, with vacant faces that, when spoken to, animate more like\nmarionettes than people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_01-2.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11929\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_01-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_01-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_01-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_01-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Music / Sound Design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The\norchestral soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is a joy to experience, with lyrical,\nmemorable melodies and gorgeous orchestration with an almost John-Rutter-level\nof sentimental yeet. You can tell that Hisaishi is not used to writing for\ngames, however, as many tracks are written with an internal sense of narrative,\nmaking you feel as if something is about to happen while exploring an otherwise\nuneventful area. A particular mindset is needed for writing music that is\ninteresting without inadvertently building a sense of narrative expectation\nthat is incongruent with what is happening on screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_04-2.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11931\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_04-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_04-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_04-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Switch_NinoKuni_04-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually I can’t bear the voice acting in RPGs (whether sub or dub), so the fact that I had very little reaction at all to the voice acting in <em>Ni no Kuni </em>must mean that it is exceptionally good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button aligncenter\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-background\" href=\"https://switchaboo.com/2019/10/27/neo-cab-switch-review/\" style=\"background-color:#ffff00;color:#000000\">Check out our review of Neo Cab</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Score: 71%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of writing this review I realised I enjoyed <em>Ni no Kuni </em>more than I thought I did when I started. As an introduction to the genre for younger people, which I suspect is what the developers were going for, it is probably best suited, but there is a lot to enjoy for long-time Ghibli fans too.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/H2x1_NSwitch_NiNoKuriWrathOfTheWhiteWitch_enGB_image1600w-2-1.jpg?resize=900%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ni no Kuni\" class=\"wp-image-11936\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/H2x1_NSwitch_NiNoKuriWrathOfTheWhiteWitch_enGB_image1600w-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/H2x1_NSwitch_NiNoKuriWrathOfTheWhiteWitch_enGB_image1600w-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/H2x1_NSwitch_NiNoKuriWrathOfTheWhiteWitch_enGB_image1600w-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/H2x1_NSwitch_NiNoKuriWrathOfTheWhiteWitch_enGB_image1600w-2-1.jpg?resize=1300%2C650&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/H2x1_NSwitch_NiNoKuriWrathOfTheWhiteWitch_enGB_image1600w-2-1.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ninokunigameeurope/?brand_redir=358130007540204\">Facebook</a><br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS\">Twitter</a><br><a href=\"https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-remastered\">Website</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for checking out our Ni no Kuni Switch Review and thank you to our $5 and up&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/Switchaboo\">Patreon Backers</a>&nbsp;for their ongoing support:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.campedoutgame.com\">Andrew Caluzzi (Inca Studios / Camped Out!)</a></li><li>Belinda Cubitt</li></ul>\n"
