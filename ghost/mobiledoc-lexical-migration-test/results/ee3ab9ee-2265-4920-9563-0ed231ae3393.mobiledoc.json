Pictures from the latter adventure are steadily being uploaded to [this set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adders/sets/72157594457430136/) on Flickr.\n\nAfter all the fuss and horror over Le Web 3, it was nice to get away from the internet and even blogs for a while. But now, I’m back and raring to go.\n\nExpect heavy blogging ahead�\n\n\n"
