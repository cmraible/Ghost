          "The 356 model was Porsche's first production automobile, and it was lightweight and featured a rear-engine. Available in both convertible and coupe, it featured a four-cylinder engine with power sent down to the rear wheels. About 50 cars were built in Austria before moving to Zuffenhausen, Germany, where production continued until April 1965. About 76,000 cars were made altogether during its production run, and only half are said to remain today. A dream vehicle and collector item, the "

          "This Porsche was recently given a top-notch restoration by Jim and BJ Kellogg of 356 Restore, and no nook and cranny was left untouched. They have restored 130 of these cars over the past 25 years, and Jim is the author of two books that cover the restoration of the Porsche 356. It's safe to say that this vintage beaut was in good hands while it was under the knife. Aside from the purchase of the car, about $90,000 was spent on its total transformation, and that was at shop cost."

The inside of the car features a very rare bench seat, and even mentions it in the COA. Under the hood is a rebuilt four-cylinder 1600cc backed by a rebuilt 4-speed manual transmission."
