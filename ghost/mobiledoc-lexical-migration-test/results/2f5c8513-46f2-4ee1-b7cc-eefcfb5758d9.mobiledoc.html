<p>For many, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-porsche-944-turbo-ad-is-epic/">Porsche 944 Turbo</a> is a dream car. While it might not have the kind of earth-shattering power we expect in cars today, it still can provide <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sleeper-chevy-c10/">plenty of tire-smoking fun</a>. However, when you swap in a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1956-corvette-restomod/">Chevy LS3 V8</a> things take a very good turn, as you can see in the video accompanying this post. We highly approve of this, although no doubt there will be haters who complain <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ls-powered-vehicles-on-motorious/">there are LS swaps in just about anything under the sun</a> (and there’s a good reason for that).</p>

<p>With a beefy American V8 under the hood, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-porsche-944-turbo-ad-is-epic/">Porsche 944 Turbo</a> is pushing 500-horsepower. That means monstrous burnouts and absolutely brutal acceleration.</p>
<p>You might think that swapping in that LS3 means the owner of this Porsche had to then go with a GM transmission. Well, you’d be wrong, because the factory 5-speed manual can handle all that power without any issues, which really is a testament to how overbuilt Porsche made it. Furthermore, that transaxle is mounted in the rear, so the weigh distribution is close to that ideal 50/50 everyone lusts after.</p>
<p>According to Marcus Vandenberg of YouTube channel Roads Untraveled, the Porsche 944 Turbo still retains its German handling dynamics, we’re sure in no small part because of that excellent weight balance. Therefore, this car has not been entirely Americanized, but instead is now a hybrid cross of some of the best aspects from both automotive-crazed countries.</p>
<p>This beautiful build resides in the lovely territory of British Columbia. Are you surprised that America’s neighbors to the north also have a need for speed and raw power? You really shouldn’t be, since there’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/40-stolen-cars-canada/">strong enthusiast culture</a>. And the fact all major Canadian cities are really close to the US border just means our preferences are transferred on them with ease, from muscle cars to big trucks and more.</p>
