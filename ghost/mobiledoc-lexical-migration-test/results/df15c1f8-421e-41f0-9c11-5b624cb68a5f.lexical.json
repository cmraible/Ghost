This car is the closest thing to a demon that Dodge still sells today in its stock form, but that wasn't good enough for the Hennessey team.

Apparently, that's all it takes to make over 1000 horsepower in a Dodge Challenger Super Stock, which gives all Hellcat owners some hope of achieving a similar number one day.
