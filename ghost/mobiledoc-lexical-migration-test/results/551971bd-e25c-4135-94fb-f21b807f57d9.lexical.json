The guy had visited the nearby grocery store, parked the muscle car, and upon returning found it was gone. Thinking it had been stolen, he got out his phone and was about to call the police when he spotted his car parked crooked in a spot a few rows over. The Mustang GT had a manual transmission and the owner never put it in gear, plus he just knew parking brakes don’t work, plus the grocery store parking lot in question was on a bit of a slope, but of course it was that the car went rogue, probably tried to hit some pedestrians or a power pole, then when unsuccessful parked itself crookedly before waiting dutifully for its owner.",
