That’s exactly the horrific scene laid out in a YouTube video and many other social media posts recently. Since misery loves company we want the rest of you to join us in mourning the death of this Pagani Zonda C12 S, or maybe you’ll mock the guy sitting on the ground next to it, probably rethinking his life choices."

According to social media posts, this happened on a twisty road outside of Prague, Czech Republic. We can put two and two together: this guy probably thought he’s the next Ayrton Senna and so he pushed what’s notoriously a wild, raw hypercar hard, which ended poorly."

That’s a guess, but we’ve seen this scene play out many times in the recent past, so it’s not a bad one."

The parts will have to be ordered from Italy, he’ll get a fiery scolding in Italian, then he’ll have to shell out a bunch of euros for them, then pay even more for a mechanic crazy enough to touch the Pagani to get it repaired."

With a potent AMG-sourced 7.0-liter V12 making 542-horsepower (hey, it was a lot back in 2000) and 553 lb.-ft. of torque, this thing with a 6-speed manual can do 0-62 in 3.7 seconds. It also doesn’t come with all the electronic driver aids everyone seems to think are necessary these days."
