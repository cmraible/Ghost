Since I bought my first car at 17, the Navy Blue Metallic Firebird Formula I still have, I’ve been detailing my own car. Actually, when my son was a baby, I’d let him roll around in his baby walker toy in the driveway while I spent hours buffing and cleaning - if I wanted the car I raced on the weekends to stay in show shape, I had to do it, plus it was therapeutic.",
