This generation Impala SS is easy to spot thanks to its more aggressive body with 17-inch mag wheels and a monochromatic paint job. In addition to this car's sinister Black paint job, the Impala SS was only offered in two other colors: Dark Grey Green and Dark Cherry Metallic. Under the hood, these big muscle cars backed up their stylish looks with a powerful 5.7-liter LT1 V8 rated at 260 horsepower."

For its age, that is pretty low mileage, and the overall quality of this muscle sedan shows that this car was well loved and equally well cared for. Pictures of the car show a super clean exterior, and a cabin that shows no wear on the seats. It would appear that this Impala is completely unmodified as it still has the factory wheels and stereo system"
