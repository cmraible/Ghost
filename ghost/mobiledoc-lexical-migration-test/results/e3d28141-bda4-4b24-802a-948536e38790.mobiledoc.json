On the exterior one would find a custom Callaway carbon fiber grill, Callaway badges, and either 9 spoke anthracite or 10 spoke satin black wheels depending on the buyer's preference. Moving to the interior youâ€™re greeted by Alcantara trim, Aluminum pedals, an embossed horn cover, and a myriad of other interior design features that let you know that this is a Callaway. This Callaway package is compatible with the Trailboss, High Country, and LTZ trim and can be purchased through any Chevy dealer with a 3-year 36,000-mile warranty. This truck would be the perfect addition to any power-crazed truck lover and with such accessibility, to these beasts, it may very well be the coolest truck on the market today."
