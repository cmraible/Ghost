Carlisle is sending this car to the auction block with a stated 48,900 actual miles. Considering just how spotless this ride looks, that’s actually not a difficult claim to believe."

Power steering and power brakes help you keep that exterior free from blemishes. Even more of a pampering feature is the reclining twin comfort lounge seating, which is fantastic for long trips and presents very well."

The drivetrain feeds into a Twin grip differential. This vintage wagon was ordered new at Hill View Motors in Greensburg PA as a demo."
