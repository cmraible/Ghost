          "Often, American motorcyclists get a bad rap for treating the various roads and highways like a race track while endangering other cars on the road. While this is primarily a false assumption, we don't think we could have found a better example to fit that cookie-cutter stereotype than this buffoon. This dude epitomizes the phrase \"mess around and finds out\" with an ego fatter than the tires of a much faster bike and the skill of someone who had their training wheels taken off too soon. The humor of this situation lies not in the fact that he endangered himself and others, however. Instead, the reason he did it makes the icing on top of the cake that much sweeter."

The leather on the seats gives off such a sweet vintage smell, while the tight handling and hard acceleration remind you that you are in a modern-day beast. You look to your left to see nothing but open roads and grass. However, when you look to your right, an opponent emerges from the shadows. It's a motorcycle."

Obviously, you had no chance against this motorcycle because he wasn't looking for a race. Yet, in one single-handed motion, this experienced rider fought his way to victory in the backflip contest to rival the works of Giacomo Agostini."

While this flippage may not have been entirely intentional, the way that he handled it was legitimately impressive as he had to pull out some swift ninja moves to narrowly escape serious injury. We're glad that he wasn't hurt, but we hope that this has taught him that if you're going to race your bike, at least learn how to ride it first."
