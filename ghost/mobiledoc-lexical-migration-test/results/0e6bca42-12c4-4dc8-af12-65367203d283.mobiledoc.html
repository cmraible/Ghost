<p>By subscribing to <em>The Lever</em>, you’re making a choice to cut through corporate media’s simplistic narratives about the world that just don’t square with the nuance and facts on the ground. We tirelessly dig through the facts and tell the truth about the myriad challenges America is facing right now.</p>

<p>This week, <em>The Lever</em> team’s reporting pressured the <em>Washington Post </em>to issue a correction to an irresponsible<em></em>“Fact Check” column written by Glenn Kessler that called into question the case of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was unable to access abortion care in her home state. On <em>Lever Time, </em>we grilled Obama Council of Economic Advisers chairman Jason Furman on his role in propagating inflation misinformation. Sirota reported on how Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) made the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) substantially worse by exempting many private equity firms from additional taxation — despite Democrats pledging to hold the line against any<em></em>amendments to the IRA. We also pointed out that since Biden’s inauguration, any discussion of a public health insurance option is verboten.</p><!--members-only-->
