Come 1971, and the Fairlane name was completely dropped, and now Ford intermediate cars were all called the Torino. "

An aluminum radiator keeps everything running smooth and cool, and the car also features a Milodon high-volume oil pan. Power steering allows for easy maneuvering those turns, and power brakes all around bring everything to a stop. A set of ceramic-coated long-tube headers send spent gases through a Flowmaster dual exhaust. Front and rear sway bars keep everything in check, and a custom center console comes complete with cupholders. The addition of front and rear sway bars help keep handling in check."
