The agency’s troopers seem to be exceptionally well-trained, however accidents happen, even with all that training. That’s what some are saying happened when a trooper ran into a Camaro which already wrecked out and the suspect was exiting. We’ve included the video so you can make up your own mind about what happened."

Eventually, Lancaster’s driving skills ran out and he hit a guard rail, spinning the Camaro around so it was facing the wrong way. A trooper has already pulled up alongside him and Lancaster was stepping out of the Chevy when the other trooper hit the Camaro nose-to-nose."

It seems the suspect was running from police because he had the alcohol illegally. The funny thing is if he had just immediately pulled over and taken the ticket for speeding he probably wouldn’t have been caught for the beer. Instead, he’s facing a string of charges and the Camaro is all smashed up, thanks in part to Trooper Leeroy Jenkins."
