<p><em>The Telegraph</em> is seeing substantial reader growth – <a href="http://digiday.com/media/apple-news-the-telegraph/">from Apple News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For <em>The Telegraph</em>, Apple News has become the most effective third-party platform at driving readers to its own sites and app — where it can eventually turn them into subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note the contrast here to Facebook, which is doing everything it can to keep you in the Instant Articles walled garden.)</p>
<p>Two anecdotes that seem to bear this out:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I’m getting about an extra day’s worth of traffic a week from Apple News (you can <a href="https://apple.news/T3_0JneE7SBW19YcSBnw97g">sub to <em>One Man & His Blog</em> there</a>, should you wish.)</li>
    <li>My wife – a Facebook refusenik – now uses Apple News as her major news-reading interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Something’s happening here.</p>
<h2 id="theneedfornotifications">The Need for Notifications</h2>
<p>Another interesting point in the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“The main growth has been driven by the iOS10 update and a combination of our new strategy,” said Bridge. Several publishers recorded traffic increases since the iOS10 update last year, partly because of the introduction of notifications. “In the modern age, people look to consume content through notifications. That doesn’t mean they will always open them and click through.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For breaking news – you need to have a notification strategy, but one that doesn’t get your notifications switched off.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
