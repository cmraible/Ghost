<p>As progressives <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bernie-to-house-progressives-hold-strong/">engaged in battle this week</a> to save the party’s reconciliation package, corporate news outlets pulled off their masks and began actively working to help their corporate owners kill many of the safety net provisions in the far-reaching bill. One outlet, <em>Politico</em>, even openly admitted that its hit pieces were directly sponsored by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PHRMA), the pharmaceutical industry’s main lobbying group. Such efforts are one more reason why the work of independent news outlets is more important than ever.</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/video-following-the-money-in-the-battle-over-the-reconciliation-bill/"><strong>VIDEO: Following The Money In The Battle Over The Reconciliation Bill</strong></a><strong></strong>(‎Breaking Points) — <em>Sirota joins </em>Krystal and Saagar to our ongoing coverage of the reconciliation bill, part of our new weekly collaboration with the popular podcast and Youtube show.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-insider-from-the-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-speaks-out"><strong>An Insider from the Purdue Pharma Bankruptcy Speaks Out</strong></a><strong></strong>(New Yorker) — <em>“Hampton depicts himself as an outsider who tries to do the right thing, only to learn that the game has been fixed from the beginning. He wants justice—’pure justice, the kind we read about in books and see in movies. Balance is restored to the galaxy, the bad guys are vanquished, and all get what they deserve.’ But he soon realizes, ‘I was in a completely different league, playing by a set of rules that made no sense to me.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.si.com/wnba/2021/09/20/wnba-vaccination-99-percent-daily-cover"><strong>What Can We Learn From the WNBA's Vaccination Success?</strong></a> (Sports Illustrated) — <em>“If the league were to mandate it and we didn’t feel like we knew enough about it, I don’t think people would have gotten vaccinated. But because as player leadership, we were saying, ‘Hey, here’s an opportunity to ask all these questions and not feel bad about it’—I think that was kind of what made people feel more comfortable, not feeling that extra level of pressure.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/"><strong>‘We’re All Fighting The Giant’: Gig Workers Around The World Are Finally Organizing</strong></a> (Rest of World) — <em>“While the nature of platform work means that workforces are atomized and divided — and platform companies have often refused to recognize workers’ groups and unions — the common experience of precarious and often dangerous work has helped to create a genuine, global movement that is taking the fight to the tech companies. ‘There is just so much commonality. And it transcends cultures and transcends languages,’ Solis said. ‘We’re all trying to figure out a way to fight back together collectively.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sicknote.co/p/cobra-subsidies-die-with-a-whimper"><strong>COBRA Subsidies Die With A Whimper</strong></a> (Sick Note) — <em>“The subsidies for COBRA, the program that allows you to keep your health insurance when you lose your job, expired yesterday. That means everyone who lost their job since March, who might have been relying on this temporarily free insurance, now faces a bill of hundreds of dollars each month to keep their plan. (If you like your plan, etc.) No one is talking about this; there are no stories from major national news that I can find, and barely even any from healthcare news outlets.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/persistence-pays/"><strong>Persistence Pays</strong></a>​ (The Drift) — <em>“In addition to the cash-grab, there is a form of brand-building that occurs when a political figure publishes a book. This is true of most political memoirs, which tend to be career-boosting props rather than literary works. They are written for a fanbase, or a potential one, as an easy chance to tell one’s own story uninterrupted and connect it to one’s political platform. The branding involved in writing a kids’ book is related but slightly different — it’s not aimed at the readers themselves (non-voters, after all) but at the subset of people who may be buying books for them. Rather than laundering their personal anecdotes into potentially controversial policy proposals, politicians-turned-children’s-authors can lapse into easy platitudes that are virtually guaranteed to please.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88ny3b/after-felicia-sonmez-sexual-assault-victims-journalism-want-reckoning"><strong>Sexual Assault Survivors in Journalism Are Waiting for Their Reckoning</strong></a><strong></strong>(Vice) — <em>“For Stuckey, and other survivors of sexual assault who work in journalism, Sonmez’s lawsuit inspired awe. They praised her courage as a trailblazer, particularly because Sonmez is still employed by the Post and has expressed no desire to leave. But the lawsuit also bit with familiarity. Some survivors worried that coming forward would implode their careers. They have struggled with editors over how to cover sexual assault. They had imagined that they would not be believed—one of the darkest, and most justifiable, fears for any sexual violence victim.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/magazine/dasani-invisible-child.html"><strong>When Dasani Left Home</strong></a> (New York Times Magazine) — <em>“For a blinding moment, Dasani felt like the city’s most celebrated child. Cameras flashed as she took the stage at de Blasio’s inauguration in January 2014. She held the Bible for the incoming public advocate, Letitia James, who called her ‘my new BFF.’ But long after the attention waned, Dasani’s family was still homeless, now living at a shelter in Harlem. Donors to the trust had expressed concern about money going to parents with a drug history. Even absent this issue, any cash donations would have counted as income, causing the family to lose its food stamps and other public assistance. Dasani came to understand that the trust was mostly for college — a fund for the future, not an exit ramp from poverty.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/spanish-heritage-classes-reclaim-language_l_614ce3ade4b01dff4b6b49b1"><strong>In Heritage Classes, The Spanish You Grew Up With Is Welcome</strong></a><em></em>(HuffPost) — <em>“‘In [Spanish as a second language] textbooks ... they’ll highlight everything but the U.S. That shows students that the Spanish you learn in an L2 program doesn’t belong here,’ said Damián Wilson, coordinator of UNM’s Spanish as a Heritage Language program. ‘For us, it’s very much highlighted that it is a U.S. language. It means that yes, we might speak a little bit of so-called Spanglish. We might say troca [for truck], we might say breca instead of freno,’ both meaning brakes. In other words, a Spanish heritage course goes beyond pushing students to master the present-perfect tense for a study abroad trip; it affirms the evolving speech and debates that U.S.-based Spanish-speaking communities, not foreign language textbooks, actually talk about every day.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2021/9/24/22690755/nirvana-night-before-nevermind-boston-concert"><strong>Nirvana in Bloom</strong></a> (The Ringer) — <em>“What wasn’t ever discussed was the Nirvana album coming out the very next day. Maybe Sangster forgot to ask about it. Maybe the band was sick of talking about it. Or maybe neither figured it was important enough to bring up. Whatever the reason was, the omission seems strange today. After all, the record was about to change everything.”</em></p>
<h3 id="a-message-from-sirota">A Message From Sirota:</h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It has been one of the busiest weeks since we started <em>The Daily Poster</em> — and one of the most impactful.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1443956552008810500">Take a look here</a> and you will see that the mask is off — major corporate media outlets are now actively lobbying to kill climate legislation.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> has been doing the opposite. We helped set up the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/whip-count-the-democrats-who-support-the-progressive-reconciliation-strategy/">definitive whip count</a> helping readers hold their representatives accountable, and progressive lawmakers’ stand last night proved that work is making a difference. We’ve also been breaking <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-bank-bailout/">scoop</a> after <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-wall-street-dem-trying-to-kill-bidens-agenda/">scoop</a> after <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">scoop</a> after <a href="__GHOST_URL__/follow-the-pharma-money/">scoop</a> demonstrating how the corrupt lawmakers trying to kill the legislation are enriching their corporate donors.</p>
<p>Our journalism is making such a big impact that <em>The Washington Post</em>’<em>s </em>top political reporter Dave Weigel just <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1443306279867461639">told readers</a> to follow our work because “the question they ask every day is ‘who's paying for these guys to do this?’ which is kind of the only question that matters.” <em>The Nation</em>’s political correspondent similarly <a href="https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/1443073451078701057">said</a> “<em>The Daily Poster</em> has been very clear-eyed and also done excellent reporting on the donors that shape the conservative Dems.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Let’s be clear: Our reporting isn’t just about Congress. As just one example: In the landmark Donziger/climate case that culminated this morning, the defendant Steve Donziger himself just <a href="https://twitter.com/SDonziger/status/1442474135590871049">declared</a> that <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> “courageous journalists stepped up (and) wrote one of the best stories ever on my Chevron-financed corporate prosecution.”</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: None of this work is possible without YOUR help.</p>
<p>I know you’ve seen me say that before, but it really is true. We absolutely could not do this work without you.</p>
<p>After one of the most hectic weeks we’ve ever had, I just want to thank you for being on our team, and being in this battle with us. We are fighting to create a better media, a better country and a better world. It’s not easy, but it’s worth the effort. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
