At the time, this was the largest six-cylinder engine in the world. Forcing cold air to feed the carburetors, the hood featured a functional scoop which was considered \"ventilation\" instead of \"ram air\" in 1954. The engine produced 170-horsepower, but it could be tuned to generate 210-horsepower when given the \"7-X' modifications that were later introduced by Hudson.
