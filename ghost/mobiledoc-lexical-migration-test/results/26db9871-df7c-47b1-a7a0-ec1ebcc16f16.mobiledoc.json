One potential cure is for creative, out-of-the-box automakers like Spyker to shake things up. That’s right, the little Dutch brand is coming back once more and we hope this time it will see the success so richly deserved."

The company has experienced all kinds of financial hardships, including a deal to buy Saab from GM which went south. However, an official announcement on December 31 shows a potential light at the end of the tunnel."
