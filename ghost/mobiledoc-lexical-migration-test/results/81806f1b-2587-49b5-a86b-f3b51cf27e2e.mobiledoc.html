<p>Few cars rival the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-c2-corvette/">C2 Corvette</a> as far as beauty, especially when it comes to American sports cars. The Stingray design was the prefect evolution from the C1, adding a more muscular, aggressive feel to match the respectable performance. This is why so many admire the second-gen Corvettes, but even among those <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1966-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-coupe-427-390-hp/">this ’66 L36</a> 427 Corvette is extra special.</p>

<p>Finished in Silver Pearl with black stripes, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1966-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-coupe-427-390-hp/">this C2 Corvette</a> was originally an Ermine White (972) car. It also has a 1967 stinger hood, instead of the original 1966 hood, which is still included with the car if you want to change it back. It rolls around with chromed bumpers, pop up headlights, driver’s side mirror, and side exhaust pipes. It rolls on 15-inch Rally wheels, wrapped in 205/75 Coker Classic red wall tires. It gets stopping power from power four-wheel disc brakes. Both the suspension and the brakes were overhauled.</p>
