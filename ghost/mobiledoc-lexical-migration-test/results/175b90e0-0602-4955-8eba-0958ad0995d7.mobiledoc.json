Whilst not worth the same numbers as the Fuelie model, this Dual Quad is widely regarded as the more robust of the two, and with just a 13 horsepower deficit, power differences are negligible too. Despite the Fuelies reputation for expensive parts and complexity, the net benefits of the Dual Quad raise further when looking at a more affordable price."

This was until Chevrolet unveiled their much needed V8. Chevrolet ramped up their engineering outputs by increasing their number of employees from approximately 850 staff members to a whopping 3000. They were determined to create an engine with the reliability and power of the Cadillac 331ci unit but with the frugality of their own in-house six cylinder engine."

For the engine they came up with, the Small-Block V8, is an engine that has stood the test of time with some of the all time greats, and lives on under licence in Mexico even today, where they are still being made as crate engines. The final production car with a Small Block Chevy ran off the line in 2003, and over 100,000,000 have been built to date. There are simply no words to describe what an impact this design had when it hit the streets in 1955."

The Chevy 210 was born with a huge array of body styles, and by 1957 the creme de la creme had been honed to perfection. Known as simply the ‘57 Chevy amongst fans, the Belair is the one to have. With a line of symmetry that takes attention to detail and rewrites it. Even the fuel filler cap was hidden behind one of the iconic tail fins so the cars lines were unharmed."
