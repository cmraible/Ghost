With many substantial powertrain options, including some of the nation's most iconic V8 power plants, the Camaro was precisely what it was built to be. When asked what a Camaro was, an executive at GM simply stated that it was \"a small vicious animal that eats Mustangs,\" and they weren't lying. This particular Camaro is the perfect embodiment of that original Chevy spirit as it utilizes one of the best performing V8 engines available in the GM lineup. However, the craziest thing about this Camaro is that it is a Yenko car, making it one of the fastest pony cars of its time. ",

This was the fastest engine/transmission combination that you could find in the 1960s as automatic transmission technology was severely lacking, and four gears was a considerable leap from the previous popularity of three-speed manual transmissions.
