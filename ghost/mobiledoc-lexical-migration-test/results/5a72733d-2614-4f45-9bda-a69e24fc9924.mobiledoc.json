          "The biggest change for the 1996 SVT Cobra was the move to a brand-new, unique powertrain – a hand-assembled, all-aluminum, dual-overhead cam (DOHC) 4.6-liter modular V8 engine. Ford had chosen to build the DOHC power plant off-line using a dozen two-member teams, rather than mixing the thoroughbred Cobra V8 motor among lesser ones at the Romeo, Michigan facility. Each team would build one DOHC engine from start to finish and then sign off on their project before sending it on its way. The personalized touch is also a practice at Aston Martin, the most exotic nameplate owned by the Ford Motor Company."

The previous owner also states that there are well over $10,000 worth of improvements under the hood that were installed by a Ford Master tech, so you can rest assured that this bad boy runs extremely well. The power goodies include a Kenne Bell supercharger kit, JLT cold air intake, upgraded runners, and BBK chrome headers, among others.  A Stage 2 clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel work with the 5-speed manual transmission to handle all the extra power."

It has since been resprayed in yellow as far as the eye can see, except for the badging. The car sports a rear spoiler, correct SVT and Cobra badging, and custom staggered American Racing wheels on all four corners."
