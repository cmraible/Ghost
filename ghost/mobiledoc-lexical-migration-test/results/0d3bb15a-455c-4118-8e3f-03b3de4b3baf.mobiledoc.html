<p>There are some mornings when you know you have to write about something — but really don't want to. I don't want to give Facebook any more attention than I have to. I don't want to see Facebook clone something else into irrelevance. But, dammit, I need to acknowledge Reels. </p>
<p>Sadly, this stuff matters to journalism, so please excuse the excursion into Zuckerworld, the marvelous digital country where we are all just commodity data points to be evaluated and sold to advertisers…</p>

<p>Facebook's long-held motto of “if you can't buy 'em, clone 'em” still appears to be true. After cloning Snapchat into Instagram Stories, Facebook has now cloned TikTok into <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement/">Instagram Reels</a>.</p>
<p>A few things to note here:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Reels is non-intuitive to find. It lives within the Explore tab. Once you open a Reel, you get the option to create ones of your own. My social feeds are full of desperate social media consultants trying to find this, and failing. But then, I suspect most of them don't use the Explore tab routinely.</li>
    <li>Reels essentially adds a third component to the 'gram. You <strong>publish</strong> to your followers on the grid, you <strong>communicate</strong> to your followers on Stories, and you <strong>entertain</strong> the <em>whole</em> Instagram audience (potentially) on Reels. Navigating those distinctions is going to be important, if the Reels product gets traction. </li>
    <li>Instagram is getting bloated. There's at least three distinct products in there now — the original grid, Stories and now Reels — and they all have very different uses. I'm in the middle of reading <em><a href="https://amzn.to/30vkirD">No Filter</a></em>, a book about the early days of Instagram, and it's quite remarkable how very different it is philosophically as a product to the one Facebook bought. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="magazine-subscriptions-blip-or-boom">Magazine subscriptions: blip or boom?</h3>
<p>Interesting piece from Esther, looking at the long-term viability of the magazine market. I'd have framed it slightly differently: my theory is that we are going through an accelerated winnowing process. People will quickly realise that, if they want beloved magazines to survive, they will need to contribute more directly, through subscribing, and possibly other forms of support. </p>
<p>Many magazines will <em>not</em> earn that support. Some will. Some might start winning the support, but not be able to adjust their cost bases in time. The interesting thing will be learning from the survivors, and using that to rebuild an industry which will probably look very different from the current one.</p>
<p>I should write more about this. </p>

<h3 id="the-seductive-search-for-structure">The seductive search for structure</h3>
<p>It's reasonably well-established that a desire to see the world as ordered and comprehensible is behind the appeal of conspiracy theories. There's some interesting evidence here that people who want to believe in a structured world will reject reporting that undermines their own mental constructions as "fake news". </p>
<p>Journalism would be so much easier without all that annoying human psychology to deal with… </p>
