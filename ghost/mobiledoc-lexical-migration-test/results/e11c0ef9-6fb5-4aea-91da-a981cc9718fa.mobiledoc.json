Most badging is the result of exchanges between institutions with long-established relationships with the platform’s sales and/or partnerships teams. This means that various major talent agencies, record companies, sports leagues, high-dollar clients, and more have a direct connection to the process. Other verifications are the result of one-off meetings or private conversations with an employee at the company. If you were verified and have no idea why, it’s probably because someone inside the building likes you or you’re on their radar."

I follow former students who get verified within weeks of getting an entry-level job on a national paper, and some of the great thinkers about online community and social media over the past two decade, who aren't.
