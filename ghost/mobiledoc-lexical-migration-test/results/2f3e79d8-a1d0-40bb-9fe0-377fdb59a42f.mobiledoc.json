          " one of America's most iconic automotive manufacturers, but the most significant one must be its reputation for good old redneck fun. Cars like the third-generation Camaro have become nearly synonymous with the loud and fast antics of the southern hooligans we all know and love. However, one vehicle could be called the mullet of the car community for its design and performance. That particular car is everyone's favorite crossover, the Chevy El Camino, which, whether you love or hate it, is an American icon. One of the coolest things about these cars is that the front end is essentially a Chevelle, including the engine. However, the rear offers plenty of space for swiftly hauling loads of material. Here's a car that perfectly embodies that classic muscle truck spirit that made the El Camino such a legend. "

          " is a massive 454 cubic inch V8 engine which you might remember from models such as the Chevelle and El Camino SS. This vehicle is a tribute to the latter car, which saw some major attraction in the automotive world from fans of the brand. Like vehicles like the Syclone or other high-performance GM trucks, consumers appreciated the bridging of performance and utility, making the EL Camino SS famous for its ability. The massive displacement and Chevy design added up to a whopping 270 horsepower and 468 ft/lbs of torque for the 1972 model year putting it on par with the Corvette. "

          " has also been labeled with the classic SS emblems indicating precisely what this car is all about to all on-lookers. Of course, this pales in comparison to the interior, which has been tastefully modified to fit the vintage style of the 1970s. Next to the driver's seat, you'll find what looks like the shifter for a four-speed manual transmission, though it's difficult to tell based on pictures alone. If this truly is a four-speed car, it would be one of the nation's most desirable V8-powered muscle cars. Either way, this is a fantastic attribute to a model near and dear to the hearts of Chevy fans everywhere. "
