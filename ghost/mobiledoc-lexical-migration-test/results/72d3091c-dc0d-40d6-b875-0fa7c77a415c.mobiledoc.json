It’s also “grown into a marketing and sales firm” that’s deeply in the pocket of UnitedHealth Group, the country’s largest health insurer. That’s according to a recent report, “How AARP Puts Profits over Patients — And Principles,” put out by a dark money group called Commitment to Seniors. But while elderly patients are in fact being thrown under the bus for the sake of corporate interests, Commitment to Seniors itself has a big role in that process."
