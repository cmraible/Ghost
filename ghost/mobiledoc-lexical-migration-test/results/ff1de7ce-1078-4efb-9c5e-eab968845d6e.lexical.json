Still, we can often forget that car grand theft auto isn't just about stealing an unmanned vehicle with a signal jammer.

Some 37 years later, a curious homemaker with a taste for investigative work has only recently identified the body. So who was this man whose vehicle was worth his life, and how did his identification come about?",
