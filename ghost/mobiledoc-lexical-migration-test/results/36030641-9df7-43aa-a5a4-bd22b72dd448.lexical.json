This iteration of the steampunk robot-inhabited universe has you playing as a band of robot space pirates, going from one ship to the other and battling it out in 2D turn-based shooting combat. Steamworld Heist takes precision-perfect aiming with the ability to ricochet your bullets in order to pull off some tricky maneuvers.

With fully voice acted anime cutscenes and approximately 25 hours worth of gameplay. Sushi Striker simultaneously released alongside the 3DS version leading us to speculate that Nintendo brought it over to the Switch as they were worried about how a new IP would do on the 3DS in 2018.
