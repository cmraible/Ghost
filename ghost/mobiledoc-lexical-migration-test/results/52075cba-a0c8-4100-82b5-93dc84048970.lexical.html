<p>“It wasn't an accident. Policing in our country is inherently & intentionally racist. Daunte Wright was met with aggression & violence. I am done with those who condone government funded murder. No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can't be reformed.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/rashidatlaib/status/1381745303997534216?s=21">Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.)</a></p>

<p>The Coalition to Protect American Workers, a Republican front group <a href="https://www.axios.com/top-republicans-form-new-group-to-fight-biden-tax-hikes-e985d829-641d-4207-aaec-eb772c056a51.html">created</a> to oppose President Joe Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike, is <a href="https://buildingamericasfuture.com/">being run</a> out of a GOP dark money organization set up last year to push Congress to give businesses blanket immunity from COVID 19-related lawsuits.</p>
<p>Last summer, GOP operatives created a Virginia nonprofit called Building America’s Future to <a href="https://protectus.buildingamericasfuture.com/">launch</a> a campaign under the name, “ProtectUs.” The campaign demanded that Congress protect college universities from "frivolous lawsuits” that could prevent them from reopening. Fortunately, Congress never passed Republican senators’ <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-proposal-would-retroactively/">sweeping liability shield proposal</a>.</p>

<p>Now, Building America’s Future has launched the Coalition to Protect American Workers, which is <a href="https://coalitiontoprotectamericanworkers.com/">warning </a>that “just when Americans are seeing light at the end of the tunnel, politicians in Washington are creating obstacles to new jobs by threatening to increase taxes.”</p>
<p>The coalition is being led by Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence. The group is claiming it “plans to spend at least $25 million on TV and digital ads and organizing,” according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/top-republicans-form-new-group-to-fight-biden-tax-hikes-e985d829-641d-4207-aaec-eb772c056a51.html"><em>Axios</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Monday, acclaimed filmmaker Adam McKay made headlines <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/04/adam-mckay-calls-aaron-sorkin-right-wing-in-new-york-times.html">pointing out</a> that <em>West Wing</em> creator Aaron Sorkin has often used movies and television to subtly promote a conservative ideology.</p>
<p>McKay is absolutely correct, as evidenced by a terrific podcast <a href="https://westwingthing.libsyn.com/size/5/?search=sirota"><em>The West Wing Thing</em></a>, which has meticulously tracked this phenomenon. But if you need a particularly clear example, hearken back to a key scene in this May 2001 episode of the show that was <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/west-wing-wisdom-paying-fair-share-taxes/">touted</a> by the conservative leaning Tax Foundation — and remains relevant in today’s political debate over taxes.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8nzeJrXFttg?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></figure>
<p>As you’ll see, White House speechwriter Sam Seaborn complains to Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) staffers that in his previous job as a $400,000-a-year corporate lawyer, he felt it was unfair to lob names like “wealthy” during discussions about tax policy, and he insisted that “the top one percent of wage earners in this country pay for 22 percent of this country.”</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that this episode wasn’t released in a vacuum. It was aired at precisely a moment when it would have maximum political effect in the real world: At the time it was broadcast, the actual CPC was trying to stop President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact, <em>Newsweek </em>reported at the time that Progressive Caucus lawmakers had <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/periscope-150197">contacted</a><em>West Wing</em> producers alerting them to <a href="http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/uen_0201_apd.html">Bernie Sanders’ alternate, far-more-fair tax cut proposal</a> to see if the writers might mention it on the show.</p>
<p>Sorkin’s writers obliged by mentioning the CPC in the episode — but then had Seaborn scoff at their ideas.</p>
<p>Despite Sorkin’s condescending portrayal of the left, the CPC managed to get a piece of Sanders’ progressive tax policy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2001/US/07/20/tax.rebate/">included</a> in the final tax bill that passed that year: direct payments to individuals and families.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• BIDEN LIKELY TO EXTEND TRUMP’S MINIMUM SENTENCING RULE: </strong>Biden is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/12/fentanyl-drug-sentencing-biden/">poised to support temporary continuation</a> of a Trump-era rule expanding mandatory minimum sentencing for a number of fentanyl-related offenses. More than 100 civil rights, public health, and criminal justice groups signed on to a letter urging the president and Congress to oppose extending the rule. Biden campaigned on abolishing mandatory minimum sentencing rules — the same rules he championed in the 90s.</p>
<p><strong>• COVID TESTING DROPS: </strong>As it stands, about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/percent-of-us-population-vaccinated/2021/04/08/034be0aa-971a-11eb-8f0a-3384cf4fb399_story.html">20 percent</a> of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/covid-vaccine-total-latest-b1826387.html">more than a third have received one jab</a>. However, even as vaccinations increase and states loosen restrictions, COVID variants are rising and cases are surging in some states like Michigan. Despite this precarious position, daily U.S. testing has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-vaccinations-increasing-happened-covid-19-testing/story?id=76954250&cid=social_twitter_abcnp">dropped roughly 30 percent</a> since January. That means case numbers the country is reporting could be less accurate.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN SAYS NO TO SHUTTING DOWN DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE: </strong>In a blow to climate activists and Indigenous tribes like the Standing Rock Sioux, Biden has <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/biden-dakota-access-pipeline-2652502898.html">opted not to shut down</a> the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). Opponents of the pipeline decried the decision, pointing out that the project is operating without a permit and poses serious environmental risks as the world faces a future beset by the effects of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN WANTS BIGGER MILITARY BUDGET THAN TRUMP: </strong>The Biden White House has proposed a <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/547340-biden-requests-753b-defense-budget">$753 billion defense budget</a>, with $715 billion allocated for the Pentagon. Those figures represent increases from Trump’s $738-billion defense budget last year, which funneled $704 billion to the Pentagon. The news was met with criticism from progressive lawmakers. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-military-budget/">told </a><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-military-budget/"><em>The Nation</em></a> that “With so many people across the country struggling to make ends meet, the last thing we need to do is increase investment in wasteful Pentagon spending.”</p>
