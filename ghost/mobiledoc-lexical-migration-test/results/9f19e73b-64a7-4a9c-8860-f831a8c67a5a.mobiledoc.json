Sure, there are those crazy experimental ones they run around certain parts of the city with huge LiDAR domes and other incredibly expensive sensors jammed every which way. But I see other at least partially self-driving cars, in particular Teslas, far more often. Despite the tales about how these automated driving technologies are, the data shows they’re crashing far more than more probably suspect."

That’s not the utopia any of us have been promised by many in the media and tech industry."

Of course, some members of the media wasted no time pointing out 273 of the self-driving cars involved in accidents were Teslas, insinuating that they’re inferior to other options on the market. Just keep in mind they’re easily the most ubiquitous brand offering automated driving systems, so that could be why the constituted the lion’s share of the data."

          "What we do learn from the study is a little more about how well exciting autonomous drive technologies work in the real world. In the reported crashes, 6 people died and 5 were seriously injured. Safety advocates have portrayed these deaths and injuries as the result of NHTSA not stepping in and imposing minimum performance standards for autonomous drive systems. That logic would assume government can regulate away nearly all accidents, which hasn’t worked in any other area like backyard pools, so why would it work here?"

Honda reported 90 such crashes, putting it in second place, with Subaru coming in next at 10. The remainder of the automakers in the study reported 5 or fewer crashes. That seems a little… interesting. The potential for reporting “errors” could be significant, calling into question the validity of this study."
