<hr>
<p>The Chevrolet Corvette's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/special-edition-c3-corvette-deserves-a-place-in-your-collection/">third generation</a> ran for an impressive fifteen years. In that time, the Corvette transformed from a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-shelby-gt350-icon/">hard-edged sports car</a> to a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/abandoned-c3-corvette/">luxury grand tourer</a>.</p>
<p>This change was necessitated by many external factors, from government regulations to a fuel crisis to changing consumer demand. As a result, we're most fascinated by the early urethane bumper cars.</p>

<p>From 1973 to 1976, we saw the Corvette lose its chrome bumpers, its big block, and even its convertible body style. While late impact-bumper C3 Corvettes are relatively common, stumbling upon 1974 and 1975 convertibles is a rare treat.</p>
<p>At the time, there was a real concern that the US government would outlaw convertibles due to safety concerns. As a result, most domestic manufacturers stopped building them.</p>

<p>Just 5,474 Corvette convertibles were built in 1974, which was also the final year of the 454 big block and the first year for a urethane rear bumper. 1973 Corvettes already had a urethane front bumper, but 1974 completed the look with a new rear end treatment. </p>
<p>1974 Corvette rear bumpers are unique in that they're a two-piece affair, with a visible seam running vertically through the center. The following year would see this setup replaced with the one-piece unit that would last until the end of C3 production in 1982.</p>
