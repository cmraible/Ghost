<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Last night, our scoops about Amy Barrett were <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1315822519748763649">featured</a> on NBC’s new news channel — and at the confirmation hearing this morning, there has been mention of the little-noticed cases we’ve exposed. Once again, it is proof that our small team is having a big impact.</p>
<p>As we enter the final phase of the election and its aftermath, we have some big stories we are trying to break open — but to do that, we need as many free subscribers to become supporting subscribers right now, to help us hire the reporters we need.</p>
<p><strong>Can you <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber to help us?</strong></p>
<p>When you become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber, your support goes directly to fund our reporting — it helps us hire reporters, pay for document requests and do all the work of journalism. You also get all of our subscriber-only content.</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s the thing: if every one of our free subscribers <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>clicks here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber, we can fund an entire newsroom of reporters holding politicians accountable every single day.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request — and stay tuned for some more big stories coming up this week.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
