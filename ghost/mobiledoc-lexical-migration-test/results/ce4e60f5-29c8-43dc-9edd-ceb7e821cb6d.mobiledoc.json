The pursuit hit speeds upwards of 100 mph, which might not sound horribly fast but if that was on narrow, winding city roads that’s enough to make anyone sweat. Honestly, the report sounds like a chase scene from a movie, although we doubt the driver had the kinds of skills on display in films like "

Eventually, the Jaguar lost its wheel on the front passenger-side, as well as the tire on the front driver’s wheel, reminding us of the old Christmas carol. Even though those probably weren’t drive wheels, it’s kind of hard to steer when you’re missing one front wheel and one front tire, so police were able to take the 45-year-old driver into custody and held him on theft of a motor vehicle, dangerous driving, failing to stop and failing to provide a breath test."
