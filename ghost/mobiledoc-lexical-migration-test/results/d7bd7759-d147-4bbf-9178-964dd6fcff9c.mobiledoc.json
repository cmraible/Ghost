Ever since the Cayman came out, there have been many who suspected Porsche brass didn’t want to push performance too far for fear of making the 911 look bad. We can argue all day long about if that was the case or not, but with the GT4 RS using the same flat-six engine as the 911 GT3, there’s finally a solid equivalence between the two."
