Yet the out-of-the-way rural nature of the place might have been why the driver selected just such a place to push the envelope with his new mid-engine American sports car. A track might have been a better choice, although we’re not entirely sure the results would’ve been much better."

However, it looks like the driver was trying to drift his C8 Corvette through a turn on the road by the river. The front wheels are turned to the left, but the sports car just keeps going straight as the tires squeal loudly. Then the Chevy jumps the shallow curb and eats it in the shrubbery on the side of the road."

While we don’t have any photos of the front end of the Corvette, it’s reasonable to guess it’s pretty trashed by the impact. And knowing what we do about insurance these days, there’s a possibility it’s been totaled, especially if the airbags deployed. But there’s always a chance it wasn’t totaled out, considering such decisions seem like they’re decided by casting some bones on the ground by the campfire."
