<p>Some people laughed or got angry when we said <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-muscle-catnip-to-criminals/">modern Dodge muscle cars are catnip for criminals</a>. Apparently, pointing out that the high-powered Dodges are big <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/police-stop-car-hauler/">time theft targets</a> is anti-Mopar to certain people, but we’re constantly vindicated as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-theft-thwarted/">these muscle cars are stolen constantly</a>. Even better, the city of Sterling Heights Police Department is warning everyone in the Metro Detroit area that thieves really, really want their Challenger or Charger (and your <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-dodge-durango-hellcat/">Durango Hellcat</a> when you get that).</p>
<p>According to the police, they’ve seen a dramatic spike in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stealing-dodge-challengers-london/">Mopar muscle car theft</a> in the area. We believe it, because we don’t pass along even a tenth of the stories we come across. In just 10 days’ time, 4 high-speed chases involving a Dodge Challenger or Charger were reported by Sterling Heights Police. For example, one involved a suspected stolen car traveling at over 90 mph before the chase was called off.</p>
<p>Recently, would-be thieves broke through a glass door to get into Sterling Dodge to swipe some cars. We’re assuming they were looking for Hellcats, since those are the models criminals want the most. Fortunately, a cleaning crew was at the dealership and the crooks were scared off by their presence.</p>
<p>We’ve seen it all lately, from crooks <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-steal-hellcats/">swiping dozens of Mopars</a> from dealerships (and some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-dodge-challenger/">failing</a> in the process) to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-dodge-challenger-scat-pack-widebody-using-sunroof/">wrenching open a sunroof</a> and jump-starting one. They’ve been swiped from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-hellcat-thieves/">people’s driveways</a> at night and in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/challenger-with-ashes/">busy parking lots during the day</a>.</p>
<p>A local news story makes 4 suggestions for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">securing your Dodge Charger or Challenger</a>: install an alarm system, put in a GPS tracker, park in your garage, or park in a well-lit area. Modern Mopars have a factory alarm which even pushes notifications to a smartphone, but some owners complain it won’t sync with their device. They also come with a GPS tracker embedded in the car, but again certain owners claim the tech doesn’t work properly. It might not be a bad idea to get aftermarket systems if that’s the case.</p>
<p>As for parking in a garage, that helps but it’s not a failsafe. We’ve seen criminals <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-steal-chevy-camaro/">break into garages</a> at night, so even better is to physically lock the door. And from what we’ve observed, parking in a well-lit area does pretty much nothing considering thieves take cars in broad daylight from busy areas.</p>
