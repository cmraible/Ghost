<p><strong>Restored 1907 Cadillac One-Cylinder Is Still Kicking After A Long Life And Emotional Backstory</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/06/ratio3x2_2400-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/ratio3x2_2400-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/06/ratio3x2_2400-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>As car enthusiasts, we all have our dream cars. Some dream of a day when they’ll be able to sit behind the wheel of their very own track-capable Ferrari. While others opt for the emotional gratification that comes with an older model of car. In this case, the former owner of this luxurious Cadillac from over 100 years ago chose the latter of the two. While the car, now 114 years old, was certainly a challenge to restore, it now outshines even the best of its time in style and luxury. Of course, every classic car comes with an emotional background and this is no exception to that rule.</p>

<p>Shawn Davis of AutotopiaLA checks out an absolutely killer supercharged ’40 Ford Deluxe built by Timeless Kustoms and it’s absolutely, mind-blowingly good. At just a glance, most people wouldn’t suspect some classic-looking vehicle like this to be laying down serious power, but this thing might give a Dodge Hellcat a run for its money.</p>

<p>The Corvette is an American hero in the sports car market. This model came out swinging against the notion that a car can have performance and a certain level of luxury, while also being made in America. What the moniker has evolved into is basically an affordable exotic or supercar, but it's where it came from that we're talking about today. Here are some of the coolest classic Corvettes for sale on Motorious.</p>

<p>One of the most famous innovations of the great Parnelli Jones came behind the back of co-driver Bill Stroppe. Secretly sharing his design with Stroppe mechanic Dick Russell, the pair began building a Bronco that would go on to change Baja racing forever. Initially upset by the deception of his team sneaking around behind his back, Bill Stroppe quickly saw the extreme potential in Jones’ designs and jumped on board. This decision would lead them to victories in 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1974.</p>
<p>The machine affectionately labeled as ‘Big Oly’ became one of the most famous Broncos ever built for Baja racing. Its design began with a tubular chrome moly space frame and implemented aluminum and fiberglass bodywork for an incredible amount of weight savings. Under the hood, a Windsor 351-cid engine produces a whopping 390-horsepower that it pushes through a modified C6 B&M hydro transmission. Two 22-gallon fuel cells allowed the racer to drive longer with less fuel stops and built in thermos jugs kept the team hydrated through the grueling race.</p>

<p><strong>Basically New 2018 Nissan GT-R NISMO</strong></p>

<p>The 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO made it around Germany’s proving ground track in just 7:08.679. This incredible feat happened due to the GT-R's nearly 600-horsepower engine and dual clutch transmission, a full NISMO tuned suspension, and a creative use of carbon fiber to reduce weight and create downforce. Since the model year that set the record lap, Nissan and NISMO have been working to further the design each year, improving handling and acceleration capabilities. This 2018 Nissan R35 GT-R NISMO is a prime example of the GT-R’s recent advancements.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, we see a whole lineup of Honda motorcycles from back when they absolutely blindsided Harley-Davidson in the 60s. Many of the bikes look absolutely amazing, other than being a little dirty from sitting in the barn for so long. But as Steve points out, at least one of them has well under 1,000 original miles on it, so that’s why they’re wonderfully preserved.</p>

<p><strong>2005 Morgan Aero 8 Has Only 11K Miles</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-10.11.40-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1000" height="552" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-10.11.40-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-10.11.40-AM.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Powered by a 4.4-liter BMW engine that’s backed by a six-speed manual transmission, this unique 2005 Morgan Aero 8 is unlike anything you likely have in your collection now. The Morgan Motor Company built sports car is an evolved species of the brand. During the limited generational run, there were only 200 vehicles produced during the 2005-2007 design. With only 11,000 miles on the clock, this example, combined with the rarity, is going to be hard to top.</p>
