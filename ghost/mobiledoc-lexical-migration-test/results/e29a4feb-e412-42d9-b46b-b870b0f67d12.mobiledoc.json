          "If most people were able to choose a color for a classic Corvette, it would be red. That’s what makes the Sportsman Red exterior of this car so appealing. It has a very reserved amount of chrome, unlike what you find on later examples like the 1957 model year, so there’s an understated, classy nature to the American sports car. That fact also really makes those whitewall tires pop."

Apparently refurbished by none other than Corvette Mike in Anaheim, California in the early part of this century, it’s obvious the C1 has been well-cared-for since."

Triple Carter side-draft carbs and “beehive” air cleaners help give that extra surge when you lay on the gas. The engine works with a smooth two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission for easy cruising in the city or out on the open road."
