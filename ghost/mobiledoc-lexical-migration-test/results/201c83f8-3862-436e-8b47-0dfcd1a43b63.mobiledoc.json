Quite a few internal parts have been installed, including a 996 GT3 crankshaft, 993 GT2 EVO mechanical rocker type camshaft set, and 962-type throttle bodies. Twin spark plugs, a MoTeC management ignition system, and Alpha P993 GT-28 TIAL high-flow twin turbochargers enhance performance further. There are many other modifications done to this car, but the result is peak output exceeding 600-horsepower."

Among them are RSR style steel fenders, R-style taillights, center-fill hood, Jabroc front spoiler, ducktail rear spoiler, and 934/935-style side mirrors. To really punctuate the one-of-a-kind nature of this Porsche, a famous designer used a one-off color for the paint."

A roll cage adds to the structural rigidity of the car, allowing it to handle the large power increase. Leather covers the bars as well as the hardback sport seats and quit a few other surfaces, adding an elegance to the space. Wool carpeting and a unique weave for the seat and door panel inserts matches the exterior color. Many callouts to influential Porsches are included, like the gauges inspired by the 356 and a wood shift knob similar to the Porsche 917’s."
