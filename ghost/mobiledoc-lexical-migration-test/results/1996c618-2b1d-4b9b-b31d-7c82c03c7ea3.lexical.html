<hr>
<p>We’re big fans of the now-dead <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/chevy-ss-hennessey/">Chevrolet SS Sedan</a>, the car with a non-descript name and a ho-hum exterior design which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-ss-lsa-races-amg-gle-63-s/">flew under the radar</a> so much. For those who aren’t aware, the car was actually an imported <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/holden-death-closes-another-chapter-in-car-history/">Holden</a> Commodore with bowtie badges. Even though it has four doors, which seems to be a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-2-door-retro/">capital offense for some enthusiasts</a>, this thing is truly a performance machine. We would even call it a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-dodge-charger-scat-pack-widebody-review/">muscle car</a> because it sure feels like one.</p>

<p>Even in factory form, the SS Sedan is a total <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sleeper-chevy-c10/">sleeper car</a>. We love seeing these modified and taken to an even higher level of performance, like the one in the video accompanying this article. To throw people off even more, the owner has used Holden badges, something most Americans wouldn’t recognize. It’s possible people think it’s some weird European car, but almost nobody would suspect it’s nearly as powerful as it is. Maybe the LSA badging gives a little bit away.</p>

<p>Thanks to an LSA supercharger, this SS Sedan is now pushing about 650-horsepower at the wheels when running E-85. The LS3 V8 pushes 415-hp without that forced induction, so it’s a big boost. He could’ve gone even more aggressive, but this car is a daily driver and it needs to also be comfortable. Considering it’s a full-size sedan with comfy leather seats and plenty of rear legroom, that’s part of the point of owning an SS Sedan.</p>
<p>Just like the owner guy says in the video, a lot of people think the SS Sedan is a Malibu or Impala since the styling is similar and you don’t see many of them around. The great thing about a car like this is people aren’t going to be trying to race you constantly, but you have plenty of performance for when you want to use it, like on a track.</p>
<p>Check out the video to see this Chevy really rip and hear that supercharger.</p>
