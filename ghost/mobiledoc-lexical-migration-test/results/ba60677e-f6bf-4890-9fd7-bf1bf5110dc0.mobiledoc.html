<p>Friends:</p>
<p>In the last week, we’ve proven that grassroots-funded accountability journalism works — our stories have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-backtracks-after-tmi-report">forced the Biden campaign to backtrack</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trumps-usps-chair-grilled-after-tmi">helped congressional Democrats</a> skewer Trump’s postal service cronies. Now we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Can you go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> and become a supporting subscriber? It’s IMPORTANT.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, you are a free subscriber to this newsletter — and we appreciate that. But we are trying to hire more journalists to expand, and the only way we can do that is if free subscribers <a href="#/portal/signup">become monthly or annual supporting subscribers</a>. We are SO CLOSE to having enough subscribers to bring on more reporters — and if we get there we can expand this work in so many ways. And here’s a bonus: when you become a subscriber, you get our exclusive subscriber-only content.</p>
<p>I know politicians are probably asking you for money all the time, but this is something different. Our work is focused on making an impact — and that’s what we’ve been doing. Our stories helped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/boom-your-support-helped-us-just">shame Gov. Andrew Cuomo</a> into limiting his horrible corporate immunity law. We also successfully <a href="__GHOST_URL__/georgias-misleading-covid-map">shamed Georgia’s GOP state government</a> to stop misleading the public about the spread of the pandemic. And we’ve been breaking open <a href="__GHOST_URL__/joe-kennedy-touted-commission-that">big</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/rep-richie-neal-sends-threatening">stories</a> in the upcoming primaries in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Amazingly, we’ve been able to do this with only a tiny group of part-time contributors. We are going to be able to do so much more if we can hire more journalists. But again, the ONLY way we can do that is if we get enough supporting subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Please <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> and become a supporting subscriber — and please pass this on to anyone you know who might also be willing to pitch in.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for considering this request, and for your support in doing this work. We cannot do this without our subscribers.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
