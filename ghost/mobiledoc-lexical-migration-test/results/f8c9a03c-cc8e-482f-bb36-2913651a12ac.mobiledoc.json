This generation also introduced independent rear suspension, which would remain on the car even to this day. The Sting Ray name also appeared with this generation and this particular model made use of the hood “stinger” as it has come known to be. The love affair continues to this day with the Corvette, straight from the mind of Zora Arkus-Duntov. From Zora Arkus-Duntov's mind, through our consignor's vision and now to your eyes, we offer up this C2 second year 1964 Sting Ray coupe. See it "
