<p>First off, Bruiser Conversions starts with your 4-door Jeep Wrangler JKU and extends the frame along with the fuel and electrical systems. Your JKU is modified to wear a Chris Durham Motorsports Gladiator front clip, so it looks retro-cool and far more unique than those new Gladiator trucks. A custom payload with an integrated rollbar is bolted on, and you get to choose either a Fleet Side or Step Side steel bed. Because Jeeps are all about open-air driving, the Honcho Step Side uses the removable Freedom Top panels from the factory. After all the body modifications have been done, all paint is color matched so everything looks perfect.</p>

<p>While you can haul stuff in the payload, the Honcho Step Side is great for hauling ass, too. Bruiser Conversions will throw in a GM Performance LS3 engine or a Cummins R2.8 Turbo Diesel for loads of horsepower and torque. Not only will that get you through those horrible mud bogs and sand dunes, either engine works great for some sick burnouts on pavement. Off-road bumpers, a Warn winch, electronic lockers, 20-inch beadlock wheels, 42-inch BFGoodrich Krawler TA tires, Teraflex Falcon shocks, Rigid Industries LED auxiliary lights, and many more functional goodies are included. Bruiser Conversions also provides a long list of optional equipment, so you can get an even more customized truck.</p>
<p>Picking up where the popular JK Crew conversion left off, the Bruiser Conversions Honcho Step Side is a great way to stand out and enjoy a highly functional custom pickup truck. Thanks to the legendary work of <a href="https://www.bruiserconversions.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Bruiser Conversions</a>, you can go with this option without worry, and if you ever need to resell your vehicle buyers will also know the work was done properly.</p>
