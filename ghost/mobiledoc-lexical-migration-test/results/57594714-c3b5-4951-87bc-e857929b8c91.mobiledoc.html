<p>The National Automobile Museum is turning 30 this month, and it held a party last Saturday to commemorate the moment. But it wasn’t some overly-dignified event with plenty of champagne flutes, black ties, and formal dresses. Instead, the idea was to hold a 1980s-themed bash to celebrate the milestone. Even better, attendance was free to the public, so everyone can join in the fun.</p>
<p>Not only could the public get into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/359180/car-museums-young-visitors" rel="nofollow">museum</a> for free, they were encouraged to dress up in 1980s fashions. That means plenty of acid wash jeans, permed hair, big should pads, and fluorescent patterns were seen. A guest DJ spun quite a few musical hits from the decade and people had the chance to get their photos taken with the gold-plated <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/DeLorean/DMC-12" rel="nofollow">DeLorean DMC12</a>, one of the most 80s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">cars</a> known to man.</p>
<p>Back when the National Automobile Museum opened in 1989 it was ahead of the curve. Instead of following the trend of other car museums cramming cars into a warehouse, the museum in Reno adds a little more pizazz to its presentation. Art galleries, simulated street scenes with some of the cars, and other creative displays constitute a more lively and dynamic way to appreciate the vehicles which have helped shape the nation.</p>
<p>This approach has made the museum a popular attraction for gearheads not only in the United States, but those who visit from other countries. With stellar online reviews and a steady stream of patrons, there seems to be plenty going well for the establishment.</p>
<p>The National Automobile Museum boasts over 200 cars on display, making it a place anyone with gears in their head can spend hours upon hours. Not only can you look at the many vehicles, there are hands-on displays to give you feel for what cars were like back in the day. Normally admission is $12 for adults and $6 for youth, but that of course wasn’t charged on Saturday. If you ever find yourself in Reno or nearby, it’s worth taking the time to visit the museum.</p>
