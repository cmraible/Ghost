<p>Labor actions captured the nation’s attention this week, as health care workers launched the largest nurses strike in U.S. history and railroad employees threatened to launch a major rail strike. In a series of stories, <em>The Lever</em> exposed the common denominator fueling labor unrest in these vital frontline industries: Executives and shareholders reaping exorbitant payouts from booming profits, while crying poor and denying workers better pay and benefits.</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em> also broke a number of other key stories, including how the architects of the 2008 financial crisis are funding the culture war, how President Joe Biden is sabotaging his own clean water initiative, and how Joe Manchin admitted the truth about his dirty pipeline deal — and his political alliances — in a little-noticed interview.</p>
