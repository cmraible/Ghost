Clever players will be able to see a few steps ahead and realise where the puzzle is going beforehand, experiencing a real sense of satisfaction in the process by making their own theories alongside Detective Di. Of course, not all of them are necessarily story related — sometimes it’s just the kind of day where the detective has to figure out how to get a cat down from the ceiling. The puzzles all serve a purpose, be it progressing the story, adding to worldbuilding and levity or expanding characterisation. They are all of varied purposes and design and certainly more than one example will be memorable for any player."

Its rich plot comes at the expense of more engaging gameplay, even amongst its point-and-click brethren. With so much material to work with from a historic, story and visual perspective, I just wish the game pushed its ambitions a little further. That said, I can’t fault the game entirely on what it doesn’t do — what it does do is never truly bad and I had a grand ol’ time following the story and making my own deductions alongside Magistrate Di Renjie. It’s surprising how much personality the game is able to give its scenarios despite the minimalist graphics, and there is definitely enough material to keep one entertained throughout its many hours as they go through the story and tackle its puzzles. It’s worth a look — get on the case, detective."
