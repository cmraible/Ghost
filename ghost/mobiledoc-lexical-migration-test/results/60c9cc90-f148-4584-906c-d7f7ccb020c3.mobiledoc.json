At one point the Dodge Challenger hit speeds of 142 mph, easily exceeding what police vehicles top out at. However, law enforcement has the power of coordination, including radios and helicopters, as well as devices like Stop Sticks to bring chases to an end."

All you have to do is watch enough videos of drivers absolutely thrashing the cars as they whip around a shutdown intersection and it’s easy to conclude they don’t care about the vehicles at all. The reason for that is many of the rides used in these takeovers are stolen."
