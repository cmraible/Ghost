<hr>
<p>Being raised by affluent, famous people might sound like a dream come true, but the reality is probably a lot different. We don’t really know, but can imagine how it might warp one’s sense of what’s normal and expected in life. That might be partly what’s behind the shocking news that Cyndi Lauper’s 24-year-old son Declyn being arrested behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz police in New York City say was stolen.</p>

<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean Declyn stole the Mercedes or that he even knew the car was stolen. It was illegally double-parked, so officers ran the plates and claim those on the vehicle belonged to something else. That’s when they started asking questions, ran the VIN, and got a hit for a stolen car report from 2020.</p>

<p>Officers arrested Declyn Lauper for felony unauthorized use of a vehicle, then released him with a desk appearance ticket, meaning he has to show up to court at a later date. Lauper was attending a memorial service for an aspiring 14-year-old rapper who was stabbed to death in the subway a few days before.</p>
<p>Cyndi Lauper and her husband David Thornton, an actor, have only one child, Declyn. Neither one has made an official comment about his arrest.</p>
<p>Their son has launched a rap career and goes by Dex Lauper. He shared a garbled video of his arrest on Instagram with his 2 million followers, but later decided to take that post down. He later posted an expletive-filled message on his stories directed at TMZ, so it’s obvious the guy isn’t loving the press attention. He later posted a fairly explicit video of him and other rappers partying on a boat with models, saying “No time for TMZ I just want some Privacy (sic) I just want some time for Me (sic)!” It seemed like a far cry from girls just wanting to have fun and all that.</p>
