However, there are definitely enthusiasts who believe it has been unfairly hated on, like how Nickelback has its ardent defenders. That’s partly what makes this guy’s effort to buy a non-running 1978 Ford Mustang II so interesting."

It comes with a 302 V8 and T5 swap, so it’s not some anemic little four-banger. However, I just know some people will still say such a vehicle should be an automatic pass, no matter the amount."

Then there’s the SN95 crowd – the less I say about them the better. So maybe a Mustang II isn’t all that bad of a project car, especially if it’s got a good powertrain."

Not everyone is determined and crazy enough to complete such a build. Or maybe there’s a deal-killer hidden in this project, something the new owner will only encounter once he’s neck deep in it."

If you’ve ever done any significant project on a vehicle, you know surprises are almost a guarantee, especially when doing something for the first time. Sure enough, as they dig into this partway done build, they find some funkiness and possible reasons why the previous owner just gave up on it. I don’t want to ruin what happens, so check out the video for yourself."
