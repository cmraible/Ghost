<p>Due to the cataclysmic failures of the two-party system here in the United States, is it time to build a real third party ‚Äî if that is even possible? On this episode of <em>Lever Live, </em>David discussed the realities and viability of building a third party with <a href="https://twitter.com/MauriceWFP?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Maurice Mitchell</a>, national director of the Working Families Party, and Vermont state Sen. <a href="https://twitter.com/senatorcp">Chris Pearson</a>, a member of the Vermont Progressive Party. </p>
<p>David, Maurice, and Chris explored the pros and cons of third-party movements. Can such efforts only be successful at the local level? Is it possible for third-party politicians to actually affect change? Are Democrats and Republicans willing to play nice with outsiders? </p>
