<p>George Brock:</p>
<div></div>> <div>Given the eye-popping sales of the iPad, people are inclined to wonder out loud if tablets will “save” journalism. Wrong question. No platform or technology will “save” anything which depends so completely on the content and how good or bad it is.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Absolutely right. The questions people should be asking are “can we provide people with a compelling experience on this device?” and “is there an opportunity to make some revenue from it?” [George has some thoughts on that](http://georgebrock.net/paywalls-and-tablets-the-news-is-better/).</div><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
