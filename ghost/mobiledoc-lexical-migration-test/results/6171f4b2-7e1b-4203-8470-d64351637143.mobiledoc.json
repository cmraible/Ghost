At times that reputation has taken a bit of a hit, but despite the mocking coming from those wearing jackets with elbow patches (some of whom are automotive journalists), the brand eventually resurrected its muscle car focus, admirably going in a direction few if any dared even think about. Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis seems to think that era not only isn’t coming to a close, but that the brand is amping the bad-to-the-bone attitude up."

Undoubtedly, it’s doing so under the direction of Stellantis, which wants to make different governments happy. Meanwhile, it’s Kuniskis’ job to spin this as an act of rebellion and defiance, you know, because branding."

Sure, it might be at a different pace now, but they’re all going to end up at the same place."
