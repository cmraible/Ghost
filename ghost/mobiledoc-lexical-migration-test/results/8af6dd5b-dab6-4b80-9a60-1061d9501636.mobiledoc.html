<p>One of the most notable <a href="https://www.guidedroute66tours.com/">Route 66 gas stations</a> is Roy’s in Amboy, California. Depending on which end of Route 66 you start at, this could either be one of your earlier pitstops or one of your last. The building has a very retro vibe, but it’s the sign that you’ll immediately recognize since it’s been featured in countless movies and television shows.</p>

<p>Another unique gas station is Cool Springs in Golden Valley, Arizona. The stone exterior is about as rugged as the desert and mountains which surround it, and it’s about as tough. Once this stop was the victim of a fire, but it was restored to keep the legend of Route 66 alive.</p>

<p>Serving as direct inspiration for Ramone’s paint shop in Cars, Tower Conoco & U-Drop Inn located in Shamrock, Texas, this gas station features some seriously cool architecture. The best is to see it all lit up at night.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/the-fourway-route-66-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Visit These Iconic Route 66 Gas Stations" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>The FourWay in Cuba, Missouri is a popular place for tourists to take their picture, thanks to the neat murals on the side of the building. This station dates back to the 1930s and was once the headquarters of a family-owned oil business.</p>

<p>Crammed to the brim with outstanding kitsch, Gary’s Gay Parita in Ash Grove, Missouri recreates a once-destroyed Sinclair station. Many consider this station to be a must-see stop along Route 66.</p>

<p>Crossing into Illinois, you’ll run into Standard Oil Gas Station in Odell. The white building with a blue roof looks fairly unassuming. However, it offered outstanding service back in the day, which is how it survived with eight other fueling options in the little town.</p>

<p>Not too far down Route 66 is Ambler’s Texaco Gas Station in Dwight. Like Roy’s, this is often either the first or final fueling station for people driving the entire highway from one end to the other. Built in 1933 and refueling cars all the way to 1999, it’s the longest-running gas station on the Mother Road.</p>
