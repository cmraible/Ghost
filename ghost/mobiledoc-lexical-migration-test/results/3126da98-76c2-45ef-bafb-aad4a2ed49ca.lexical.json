This means the 911 has been broken in but not used and abused how you might expect a typical sports car to be. Thanks to the previous owner's great care habits, you'll be more than capable of enjoying the five-speed manual transaxle to its fullest extent with minimal issue. On top of that beautiful gearbox, you also get a limited-slip differential, making high-speed handling and performance an experience to dream about.
