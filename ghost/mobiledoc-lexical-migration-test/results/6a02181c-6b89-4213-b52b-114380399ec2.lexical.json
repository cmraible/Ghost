Then there are instances like this dyno run for the Rivian R1T done by a Youtuber, which doesn’t go as planned, and it's refreshing to see something that isn't heavily scripted.",

In other words, he couldn’t get a clear read on what kind of power the Rivian R1T actually makes, so it’s likely way more than 526-hp and 563 lb.-ft. of torque. Hopefully Rivian provides an update with a dyno mode, then a proper test can be done. Until then, we’re just left to guess.",
