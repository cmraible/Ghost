If they copy the formula set out by Ford and Hyundai, these would be unibody “trucks” more akin to crossovers with an open cargo area in the rear. In turn, their utility would be severely impacted, but it’s not like anyone buys trucks to tow or haul much of anything so it’ll probably be fine."

Some claim Ram will use the Dakota name for a midsize truck to take on the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger. Others are saying both a midsize and compact Ram are coming to market."
