The game takes the isometric gameplay that is usually a place for slow, careful consideration and gives the player ample opportunities to defy that rule: while each individual floor of the tower is quite small, the player is given the chance to examine the terrain and the enemies and pick their movements quickly so the fun part can begin. The focus mechanic rewards the player for taking snappy and decisive action while the charge mechanic encourages constant movement across the map. "

Other souls that can be met at random while climbing the tower will tell the player about themselves and their stories, or simply share their own insights on the world around them. It’s not a particularly extensive cast - less than ten new faces to look forward to - but they add a much welcomed break every now and then. Their designs are also quite memorable, and the stylised pixel art serves them very well. From healing priests to primate shamans to forgotten knights, there is always at least one friendly face to look forward to in the next breather floor."

The issue arrives with the mastery system: it takes an extremely long time to master a skill and make it available. With each use of a skill, it levels up a little and utilising skills takes charges which you acquire by moving around with your precious turns; many times, you will be better served simply whacking enemies with your scythe rather than using the often expensive and hard to use skills. I have found that the best way to level up skills isn’t to organically utilise them throughout your run as you climb the tower but instead, to leave one harmless enemy alive and run laps around it to build charges and utilise the skill repeatedly on nothing at all until it levels up. It was either that or risk dying and losing both the run and my shot at having something "
