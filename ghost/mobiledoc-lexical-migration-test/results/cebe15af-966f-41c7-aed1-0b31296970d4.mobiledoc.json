But not everyone is in agreement with this assessment. Even if Hyundai and others proclaiming the end of the chip shortage is in sight are correct, other problems could keep vehicle prices high for some time."

          "With chips for automobiles in higher supply, Hyundai has been able to increase production. At its plants in South Korea, the automaker fired up weekend and overtime shifts once again. The plan is to ramp up production around the world, including here in North America, for the second half of 2022 as consumer demand continues to outstrip supply. Such a move might force the hand of competitors who haven’t shown as much excitement about returning to pre-pandemic production levels."

That was largely fueled by the weakness of the won versus the US dollar and other foreign currencies. It also didn’t hurt that consumers continue to have a strong demand for Hyundai SUVs, which provide much fatter profit margins."
