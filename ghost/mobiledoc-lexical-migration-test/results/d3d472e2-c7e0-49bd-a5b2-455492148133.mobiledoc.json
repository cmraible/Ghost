          " one of the most epic car commercials ever by trolling the Volkswagen Passat and everyone who chooses such a car. As the camera pans around the Charger, an announcer talks about the available Hemi V8 with up to 470-horsepower, which was a lot before the Hellcats stormed onto the scene. After that buildup, the announcer says it’s the Volkswagen Passat, then says he’s joking. It irked a lot of straight-laced VW fans, but we’re wondering if it didn’t inspire a few Honda people, given that one of them slapped a Hellcat graphic on their Accord."

That would be pretty amazing, but we really doubt that’s even close to the truth. Instead, this is the Honda crowd just being its goofy self, slapping whatever on their cars to try making them look cool. Hellcat owners should be flattered they’re looked up to so much by someone with a car sporting an evolved lawnmower engine."
