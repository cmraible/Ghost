However, none of them are nearly as hilarious as this video of a guy in a chopped mystery car sitting at a gas station. Before you read on or watch the video, take a guess about what this thing was before it went under the knife, because if you nail this you’re well-versed in crappy cars."

Did this guy not think about how it rains a lot where he lives? To hear him describe why he chopped apart the car doesn’t really answer any questions other than what a slower-talking, real-life Boomhouer would be like (and we’ve really been wondering about that for a while)."

The fact he’s brave or stupid enough to even take it on the freeway, let alone drive the car at that speed is astounding."
