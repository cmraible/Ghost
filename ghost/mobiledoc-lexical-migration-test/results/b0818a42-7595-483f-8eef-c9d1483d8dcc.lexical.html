<hr>
<p>Many automakers have risen and fallen in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rolls-royce-cars-expensive/">United Kingdom</a> that it can be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/keeping-dream-alive-alvis-car-company/">difficult to keep track</a> of them all. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bristol-410/">Bristol Cars</a> is, however, a standout in the crowd, making the recent news that the brand is returning to the market interesting. Even more exciting is the leaked plan of using <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-packs-insane-9-9-liter-hemi-v8/">Hemi V8s</a> to breathe some much-needed life into the new designs.</p>
<p>For those who know the history of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/a-little-of-everything-1954-arnolt-bristol-bolide/">Bristol</a>, this is a natural fit. Chrysler had a long-standing relationship with the British automaker, supplying performance engines for different models, including both V8s and V10s.</p>

<p>This admittedly awesome development was leaked by a British entrepreneur who is investing in Bristol Cars. No doubt the man wants to generate some excitement and in our book he has definitely succeeded.</p>
<p>So far, the plan involves making “remastered” version of the Bristol Cars Fighter and 411 models all by hand, providing a level of craftsmanship enthusiasts crave. The addition of a 6.4-liter Hemi V8 paired with an 8-speed automatic will thrill owners further.</p>
<p>At the moment, the goal is to have prototypes of the Bristol Fighter and 411 ready to show off by the end of the year. That might prove to be overly optimistic, as we’ve seen with other rebooted car companies, but we’ll see if the company gets it together by then.</p>
<p>With the return of Bristol Cars comes a division dedicated to restoring legacy Bristol models as well as selling restored examples and providing parts as well as other support to vehicle owners. This is a key element to boosting brand image and loyalty, something Bristol Cars or any automaker absolutely must cultivate to survive these interesting times.</p>
<p>For those who want a lively Hemi under the hood of their new Bristol, they’ll need to act sooner than later. The UK has a ban on the production of internal-combustion-engine cars going into effect in 9 years, so future Bristols will plug in rather than getting fueled up.</p>
