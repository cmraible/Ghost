<p>In 2001, Ford produced the first movie car tribute in the form of a <a href="https://jdsclassicandmusclecars.com/vehicles/26/2001-ford-mustang-bullitt">2001 Mustang Bullitt Edition</a>. This car is loaded up with options to make it standout from the other 2001 Mustangs built that year. Ford gave it unique looks on the exterior and interior, some chassis and engine upgrades makes it a bit more capable than the base models too. Rolled out with low production numbers in early 2001, the Bullitt is easy to regard as one of the top modern collectibles from the American market. Each Bullitt has a hidden sticker under the rear seat and strut tower to show its individual number - this example from <a href="https://jdsclassicandmusclecars.com">JD’s Classic Muscle Car Sales</a> is #3041.</p>

<p>This special edition was built as a tribute to the iconic Bullitt movie from 1968 - it, of course, stared Steve McQueen as Frank Bullitt. The lead’s car of choice was a Highland Green 1968 Mustang GT Fastback. When Ford created the tribute car, they offered Dark Highland Green, Black, and True Blue - only 3,041 were offered in green, out of the 5,582 in total.</p>

<p>Ford lowered the car by a 3/4”, gave it larger sway bars, subframe connectors, and Tokico shocks and struts. The Stang gets additional stopping power from beefy 13-inch rotors and dual piston calipers on the front axles, and 11-inch rotors with single piston calipers out back - both front and rear calipers are pained red. It rolls on a set of anthracite gray 17×8 torque thrusts, meant to resemble the 1968 car’s wheels.</p>

<p>The 265-horsepower/305 lbs/ft of torque engine was upgraded with an aluminum intake and twin 57mm throttle bodies. Upgraded alternator and water pump pulleys help increase engine efficiency for minimal horsepower loss.</p>
<p>Its interior is modern with a touch of vintage, as the seats have an old school pattern, and the car is rocking a white gauge cluster. Aluminum trim finishes it out.</p>
