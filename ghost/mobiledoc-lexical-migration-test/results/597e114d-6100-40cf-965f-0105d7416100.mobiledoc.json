          " incredible models from the boot of Europe, this wonderful vehicle utilizes a mid-engine platform which is perfect for weight distribution on the track. With that in mind it's easy to see that the car would be very good at handling the tight corners of a racing circuit. However, that was not the only reason the Gallardo used this well-balanced system, in reality that has a lot more to do with the all-wheel-drive system. That method of power transfer makes accelerating a beautiful experience with absolutely zero traction problems."
