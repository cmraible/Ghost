Nugget is basically a little cherub who is chained to Nate, and it’s with Nugget that you carry out various traversal and combat moves; Nugget is basically to Nate what Kazooie is to Banjo. The humour is, like Ben & Ed, edgy but hilarious. There was a general feel in development that Hell Pie was pretty crass and full of profanities, but to be honest, I didn’t think it was that bad. There’s the odd bit of effing-and-jeffing and some cartoony gore, but it’s all pretty infrequent."
