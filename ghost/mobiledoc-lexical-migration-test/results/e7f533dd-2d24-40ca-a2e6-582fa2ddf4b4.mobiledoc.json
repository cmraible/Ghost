Drone footage of the scene of the accident shows the front end of the car sitting in the island next to a tree. The rest of the Chevy ended up in the emergency lane next to the median."

The occupant cell seems to have withstood the force of the collision and no ambulances were present at the time the footage was taken, so it’s possible the driver and passenger (if one was present) weren’t injured."

Some are claiming it was speed-related, but that seems to be an assumption not based on available facts. However, it’s probably a safe assumption considering cars don’t split so gloriously unless they hit something at great velocity."

Whatever the reason for the accident, it’s a good reminder to drive safely and be aware of your surroundings at all times while driving, especially if you’re behind the wheel of a performance car. We’re just glad this accident didn’t turn out far worse."
