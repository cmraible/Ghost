Organizers for the Indianapolis 500 and the Goodwood Festival of Speed have announced plans to push back the dates until later in the year, which is much better than these events being cancelled altogether."

This will be the first time the \"Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" hasn't run in Memorial Day since 1946, and it's the first time ever the event hasn't been run in May. The 2020 IndyCar season was postponed just days before the St. Pete Grand Prix was to take place, and while it's still hopeful that event can be rescheduled, races at Barber Motorsports Park, Circuit of the Americas and Long Beach have been cancelled for the 2020 season. As of now, the Detroit Grand Prix is still scheduled as planned on May 29-31."
