What’s worse is when you have something far more valuable inside the trailer and it’s taken as well. That’s the situation Ekins Garage in West Jordan, Utah was facing when someone stole a trailer with a 1950s Dodge truck inside sometime in the night on December 21. Thankfully, someone spotted the trailer on December 26. It was recovered with everything still inside, making for a true Christmas miracle."

Ekins had been working on the customer’s truck for 2 years, making it more like a labor or love than just another job. The Dodge was loaded into the trailer so it would be ready to be delivered to the customer the next day."

Since it was snowing at the time, it’s hard to see all the details, but it appears there’s an auxiliary fuel tank in the payload and there are tube steps flanking the cab."

Unfortunately, professional thieves know how to get past such things, which is why it’s not a bad idea to consider a trailer alarm and multiple GPS trackers."

Since these people target anyone’s car, stealing even family heirlooms which can’t really be replaced, we sincerely hope they are caught and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This trend of car thefts gone wild all over the nation (and really all over the world) needs to end now."
