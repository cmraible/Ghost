Whether the concept is based upon cloning your character so there are multiple versions of you scurrying around, or whether it’s based upon your character trapezing through a level; no two stages feel the same and there is hardly any repetition. I just found it astounding how imaginative the developers are; the brainstorming sessions during development must be fun."

By collecting a bell item, your character squeezes into a cat costume and as a result, can clamber up pretty much any vertical surface (before running out of stamina and falling) which really comes in handy. Cat Mario is incredibly cute as well!"

The stamps were originally used for Miiverse posts in the Wii U version, but here they act as collectibles to fill up a nice little stamp album. Also for the completionists among us, you are incentivised to find creative ways to land on top of the flagpole at the end of each stage which permanently turns the flag golden thereafter."
