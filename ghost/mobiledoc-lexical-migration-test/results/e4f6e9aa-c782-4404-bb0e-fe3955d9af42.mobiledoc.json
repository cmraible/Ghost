EPA case in front of the United States Supreme Court closely since it not only impacts EPA enforcement practices but how other Federal Executive agencies broadly interpret and enforce laws written by Congress. The 6-3 decision handed down on the morning of June 30 will have a noticeable effect on many areas of life, including the auto industry, which I feel will be overwhelmingly positive."

          "Many news outlets are spinning this decision as a defeat for pollution control. What it really does is stop the EPA from unilaterally making rules about emissions limits, specifically for power plants. More broadly, it zeroes in on what’s called “administrative law” or Executive Branch enforcement agencies writing regulations which essentially change the laws written and passed by Congress. I and many others have had a serious problem with this practice for a long time. These unelected officials have been violating the separation of powers with impunity. Now that stops."

In Brown & Williamson, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration claimed that its authority over ‘drugs’ and ‘devices’ included the power to regulate, and even ban, tobacco products. Id., at 126–127. We rejected that ‘expansive construction of the statute,’ concluding that ‘Congress could not have intended to delegate’ such a sweeping and consequential authority ‘in so cryptic a fashion.’ Id., at 160. In Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3), we concluded that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not, under its authority to adopt measures ‘necessary to prevent the . . . spread of‘ disease, institute a nationwide eviction moratorium in response to the COVID–19 pandemic. We found the statute’s language a ‘wafer-thin reed’ on which to rest such a measure, given ‘the sheer scope of the CDC’s claimed authority,’ its ‘unprecedented’ nature, and the fact that Congress had failed to extend the moratorium after previously having done so. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 6–8).”"

That’s not hyperbole, it’s really happened and innocent people have faced aggressive prosecution. Instead, Congress, a body elected by the citizenry, would once again be tasked with spelling out what's legal and illegal. Members of Congress can then be held directly accountable if voters don’t agree with their assessment. That is cause for celebration."

          " points out this latest decision doesn’t reference Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. a case from 1984 which created the notorious “Chevron deference.” Essentially, it means if Congress’ intent in the test of a law is ambiguous, the courts can defer to a Federal Executive agency’s interpretation of that law for prosecution. However, Justice Gorsuch’s opinion seems to address that: “Where the statute at issue is one that confers authority upon an administrative agency, that inquiry must be ‘shaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the question presented’—whether Congress in fact meant to confer the power the agency has asserted.”"

Such a practice was never framed in the Constitution, which in fact has provisions to prevent such a mixture of powers. Thankfully, the Supreme Court has taken a step forward to correct this long-standing problem."
