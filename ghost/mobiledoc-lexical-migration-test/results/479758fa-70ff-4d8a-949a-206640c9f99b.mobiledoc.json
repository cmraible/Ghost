If this car is stock, which it’s doubtful that it’s exactly as it rolled off the factory line, the supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 pushes a nice 717-horsepower and 656 lb.-ft. of torque. That sure sounds nice, both on paper and with a nice burble, but the sad reality is Hellcats often times struggle with hooking up and putting that power to the blacktop."
