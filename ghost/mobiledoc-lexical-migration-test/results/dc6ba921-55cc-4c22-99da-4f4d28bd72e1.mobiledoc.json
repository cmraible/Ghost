In the dramatic, sci-fi noir narrative game Lacuna, Agent Niel Conrad of the Central Division of Intelligence must uncover a conspiracy that threatens the entire solar system. That’s a lot of pressure to put on the shoulders of a single man, and some high stakes in it’s story."

However what’s more impressive is how much agency the player has in guiding that story. Most, if not every, choice presented to the player through dialogue and investigations seem to matter, even including decisions like whether or not to arrest someone for accidental involvement in the case. A woman unknowingly assisted a criminal and I decided to be nice and let her go free. She called me later in the game to thank me and provided additional details about the criminal that I would have otherwise needed to figure out on my own. "

It will not game over and it autosaves after every decision, so you can’t reload if you make a mistake. Did you pick the wrong location? Finger the wrong perp? You’ll need to restart the whole game if you want to roll that back. I’m sure that the decision to include a punishment system like that would alienate some players but it’s inclusion is a stroke of bravery not often seen in similar games nowadays. "

You’re standing in a room trying to decide where a bullet was fired from in the early moments of the game; you make your decision of where to go and halfway to the train on your way there, Neil receives a phone call from a colleague informing him whether or not he was correct. The character goes to the location anyway to investigate rather than letting the character travel to the location, investigate it, and let the naturally occurring events define whether the player made the right decision. As it is now, someone calling me to tell me if I’m right feels akin to confetti popping out from the sides of the screen and a colorful “Good Job” flashes in the center. It’s an unrealistic reward system and it removes some of the tension the player would feel stewing on the wonder of whether or not they made the correct decision. "

Likely, the game is processing all of the dialogue options and possibilities for progression that there is, but the game is mainly based in text and only has a very scarce amount of voice acting. "
