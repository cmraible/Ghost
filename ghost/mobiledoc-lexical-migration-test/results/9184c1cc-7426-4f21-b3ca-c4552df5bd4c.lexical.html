<p>This lemon twist 1970 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1971-plymouth-cuda-restomod/">Plymouth 'Cuda</a> convertible was one of the biggest shots fired by Chrysler in the muscle-car wars, but some say it came late in the game. A beautiful job has been done with this 'Cuda, and some interesting options where ordered with this muscle car. At the front of the car, a traditional blackout split grille with single black bezel headlights flanking on either side. At the top of those lamps, a familiar Shaker Hood in Lemon Twist, replaces the original 2 port hood, and now has a corresponding black scoop. Under the hood is a 426 HEMI, which is backed by a Torqueflite A727 automatic transmission. </p>
