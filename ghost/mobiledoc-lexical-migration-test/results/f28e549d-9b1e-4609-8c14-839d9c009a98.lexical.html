Despite fervent opposition from environmentalists and Indigenous groups, the project was one of few Trump-era oil exploration projects that had<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/climate/biden-alaska-drilling.html"><em> continued support</em></a> from the Biden Administration.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/08/avi-lewis-interview-ndp-british-columbia-climate-movement-green-new-deal"><strong>Canada’s Climate Candidate</strong></a></strong> (Jacobin) — “<em>Avi Lewis is widely known for his work on both Al Jazeera and Canada’s CBC. His recent projects, such as the 2015 documentary </em>This Changes Everything<em> and the 2019 short<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/17/green-new-deal-short-film-alexandria-ocasio-cortez/"><em></em>A Message From the Future</a>, co-written with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have sought to draw attention to planetary climate crisis and the urgent need for a rapid green transformation of the global economy. Having spent his career at the intersection of media and movement politics, Lewis recently announced his candidacy for Canada’s New Democratic Party (NDP) in the coastal riding of West Vancouver–Sunshine Coast–Sea to Sky Country. In this interview, Lewis discusses the current political moment, his decision to enter electoral politics after a career in broadcasting, the NDP platform, and why Canada’s forthcoming federal election is a critical one for the climate — in British Columbia, across the country, and around the world.”</em></p>

But the historic campaign nabbed global headlines and added fuel to ongoing workers’ revolts across the world. Strikes by Amazon workers in Italy, Germany, and India are coalescing into an international struggle against the world’s fourth-most valuable company and its grueling working conditions and intensive surveillance.”</em></p>

Advocates have lauded the move as helping right an injustice that unfairly skews the state’s political power away from urban areas and communities of color… Connecticut and New Jersey were among the handful of states that enacted bills ending prison gerrymandering earlier this year.”</em></p>

<h3 id="reader-comment-of-the-week">Reader Comment Of The Week:</h3>
<p>“Best news I've read in some time. Here we see evidence that there are some important differences between Democrats and Republicans. It's great news that the NLRB will once again have leadership that actually supports working class people, rather than corporate boards and shareholder value, but the principal problem is the Supreme Court, which is packed with appointees who equate money with free speech. As long as politicians have to ask for money from big donors the political system will continue to be corrupt.” </p>
<p>— Robert Scull in response to “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-new-day-for-workers-rights/">A New Day For Workers’ Rights</a>.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
