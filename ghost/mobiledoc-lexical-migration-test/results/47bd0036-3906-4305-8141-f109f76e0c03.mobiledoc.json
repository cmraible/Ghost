In terms of speed, the modified C8 hits a top speed of 133 mph when it crosses the line, while the stock C7 tops out at 124 mph. Surprisingly, the C7 does even better in a 20-mph roll doing a better job keeping up with its more powerful counterpart losing by only about a single car length in the same distance."
