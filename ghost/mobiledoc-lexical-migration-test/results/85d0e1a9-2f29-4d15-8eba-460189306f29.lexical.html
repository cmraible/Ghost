<p>Inside the bay is slathered in Chevy Orange sits a 283 cui V8 topped with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, HEI ignition system, and intake manifold. Chrome valve covers and an air intake jazz up the otherwise-stock appearing engine. Shifting power comes from an automatic Powerglide transmission, and a 10-bolt rear end transfers power to the ground. Added performance and rumble is provided by a pair of Flowmaster mufflers, and the car is armed with power steering and brakes making it both a breeze and pleasure to drive. For sound deadening and protection, the floors have been undercoated. The car sits on a set of traditional Chevy Rally wheels with the rear sitting on Blackwell radial tires (215/65/15 front and 255/60/15 rear).</p>

<p>Originally painted in Code R Regal Red, the car is now dressed in an elegant black and is kept simple without any overkill accessories. Adding the perfect aftermarket touch is a cowl-induction hood covering the engine bay. The chrome bumpers are in good shape, and a full-width front grille keeps the front end simple.</p>
<p>The interior has been restored as needed, and original and replacement parts can be found throughout. In the dash, a full-width speedometer and high-mounted controls can be found for the lights and wipers. While the seats are in good shape, the driver’s seat has a tiny bit of scuffing due to climbing in and out of the car. The carpets still appear new, and a set of auxiliary gauges have been mounted low. In addition, this Chevy features an AM/FM cassette stereo and factory air conditioning.
