A work ethic that has earned Greening Auto a reputation for not only their unique builds but as of recently for the custom one-off machining they do for even other shops."

Using 19 years of professional experience and a unique ability for machining custom one-off parts, Greening and his team embarked on a 3-year journey that would bring to fruition an incredibly unique 1971 Ford Maverick. A real head turner that would demand the attention of some of the nations most renowned builders, and would lead to Greening being selected as a SEMA Battle of the Builders participant."

A challenge that was accomplished by a custom machined intake manifold. The use of a C&R Racing intercooler and radiator, DEI heat wrap, and custom hood louvers aided in keeping everything cool."
