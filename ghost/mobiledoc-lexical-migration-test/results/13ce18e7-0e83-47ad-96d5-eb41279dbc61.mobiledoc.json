At least that’s what they think it is. The license plate was missing and the VIN didn’t match any records on file, so they’re making a guess. In fact, they don’t even know if the vehicle is stolen."

We’d imagine someone has poured a fair amount of money into it and so they’d like their ride back. It might even be a family heirloom or hold some other sentimental value. We’d really like to see it reunited with its owner and it seems like Petaluma Police want to as well."
