They also portend the potential for future conflicts here in the West. When President-elect Joseph Biden takes charge of the federal government and its vast Western landholdings, he will enter an already-delicate situation, where armed extremist groups stand ready to rise up against the federal government.”</em></p>

<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I’ll keep it short, because after everything that’s happened the last few weeks, I need a break. In fact, I can tell you that the entire <em>Daily Poster</em> team is exhausted after continuing to report straight through the holiday without a break — and then having everything crescendo in the awful insurrection, which was a psychological blow to the entire country.</p>
<p>The significance of last week’s events cannot be overstated. We saw a president and other elected officials incite an armed assault on the U.S. Capitol, and that should live in infamy for the rest of our lives. Unfortunately, there is already an effort to try to downplay it, and make it seem like just another political conflagration that will fade into the ether.</p>
<p>We cannot let that process of normalization happen. While we cannot let the assault deter us from major priorities like $2,000 survival checks, Medicare for All and jobless aid — we also cannot become so numb to everything happening around us that a violent attack on our government is just seen as another news cycle.</p>
<p>For me, watching the events of this week was like reliving 9/11. On that horrible day, I was in the Capitol complex and then frantically fled the scene with thousands of others being evacuated. The scene was terrifying — and I am sure many people who were at the Capitol this week were similarly traumatized by the chaos and the violence.</p>
<p>While the events of this week were harrowing, they were not entirely surprising. We are working on some reporting that recounts how this was a culmination of many events and trends that have been fueling a right-wing assault on our democracy. So don’t let anyone tell you that this was some spontaneous anomaly — it wasn’t, and the idea that it was is a dishonest ruse to try to downplay what’s really going on.</p>
<p>We will have more on this soon. In the meantime, let me just thank you again for being a supporting subscriber — you are making all of our reporting possible. We couldn’t do it without you.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
