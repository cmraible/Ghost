<h3 id="the-corruption-is-getting-worse">The Corruption Is Getting Worse</h3>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/andrew-perez/">Andrew Perez</a></p>
<p>It’s been 12 years since the Supreme Court opened the floodgates with its <em>Citizens United</em> decision, allowing unlimited, anonymous “dark money” to flow into the political system. Two seemingly unrelated stories in the news this week — GOP operative Leonard Leo’s latest secret political maneuvers and crypto Ponzi scammer Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest in the Bahamas — together illustrate how the wave of corruption unleashed by the high court is now getting worse.</p>
<p>This week,<em> The Lever</em> and <em>ProPublica</em> teamed up again to document the latest influence campaign from Leo, the dark money maven who built the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority as judicial adviser to former President Donald Trump before receiving a historic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-secretive-billionaire-handed-his-fortune-to-the-architect-of-the-right-wing-takeover-of-the-courts/">$1.6 billion political advocacy donation</a>.</p>
<p>Together, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/leonard-leos-latest-supreme-court-play/">we reported</a> that Leo’s dark money network has bankrolled an army of politicians and nonprofits pressing the high court this term to ban affirmative action, allow businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ+ customers, and give state legislatures full control over federal elections.</p>
<p>The other big dark money news was the arrest of crypto Ponzi scammer Samuel Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange. A prolific political donor over the past two election cycles, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-13/bankman-fried-s-political-donations-may-be-biggest-campaign-finance-violation">is accused</a> of illegally funneling corporate money into elections and using straw donors to make illegal conduit contributions.</p>
<p>While Bankman-Fried has been perceived as a liberal donor, he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-hit-with-campaign-finance-complaint.html">recently said</a> he “donated about the same amount to both parties this year,” relying on dark channels to distribute money to Republicans.</p>
<p>“All my Republican donations were dark,” he said. “The reason was not the regulatory reason. It’s because reporters freak the fuck out if you donate to a Republican because they’re all super liberal. And I didn’t want to have that fight. So, I made all the Republican ones dark.”</p>
<p>The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SBF-FEC-Complaint-FINAL.pdf">complaint</a> calling on the Federal Election Commission to investigate whether Bankman-Fried’s dark money donations were illegal.</p>
<p>The stories on Leo and Bankman-Fried spotlight why it’s so important for Democrats in Washington to finally put an end to this era of politics dominated by secret cash.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>With a government trifecta in 2010, Democrats had a chance to preempt this dark money era by passing campaign finance reforms, but they didn’t do so before they lost control of Congress that fall. They recently sought to pass the long-stagnating DISCLOSE Act, which would require politically active dark money groups and nonprofits spending on federal court confirmation processes to name their donors. The bill once again failed, due to arcane filibuster rules that Democrats refuse to change.</p>

In Arizona last month, voters did just that, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_211,_Campaign_Finance_Sources_Disclosure_Initiative_(2022)">overwhelmingly</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-health-care-becomes-a-human-right/">approving</a> a measure to require nonprofits spending on politics to disclose their donors.</p>
<p>Last week, the anonymously-funded Goldwater Institute <a href="https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Verified-Complaint.pdf">filed</a> a lawsuit to block the measure from being implemented, arguing it violates Arizonans’ right to free speech. It’s more proof that Democrats must move to ban dark money nationally.</p>
<p>Republicans have, for years, inserted provisions into spending bills that bar the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from requiring companies to disclose their political donations. With the SEC now <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-219.pdf">prosecuting</a> Bankman-Fried, including for misusing company funds to make political donations, Democrats must work to ensure the agency can finally require such disclosures.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the corruption will worsen, the right will continue shoveling anonymous money into campaigns to roll back Americans’ rights through the courts, and scammers will keep quietly buying influence in Congress.</p>
