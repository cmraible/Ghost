<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering we got Bayonetta and Cloud as DLC in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U & Nintendo 3DS</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we now feel as though anything is possible. So we decided to put together a list of the top 10 characters that we would like to see come to Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo Switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that this list is in no particular order and we do have an honourable mentions list down the bottom for those that didn’t make the initial 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would’ve included the Inklings from Splatoon in this list, but considering that they were already confirmed in that beautiful trailer that we got in the Nintendo Direct, we no longer need to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So without further ado, here are our top 10 characters that we would like to see come to Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo Switch… </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Simon Belmont</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1555" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1555" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1555" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Simon-Belmont-Credit-Super-Smash-Bros.-Crusade.png?resize=900%2C316" alt="Simon Belmont Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="316" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say what you will about Konami, they haven’t completely forgotten about their franchises. We recently saw a skin of Simon Belmont in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Bomberman R</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a recent update and he is definitely a fan favourite. He is also very iconic for Nintendo fans, having been around since the very beginning of the Castlevania games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, I think it is more likely that we’d see Bomberman come to Smash before we’d get Simon Belmont, but we can dream can’t we?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the use of his whip in all eight directions, being able to block projectiles, and holy water and the crucifix as secondary weapons, we think that Simon Belmont could bring a very unique fighting style to the fray.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Chibi-Robo</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1556" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1556" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1556" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Chibi-Robo-Tweet.png?resize=544%2C659" alt="Chibi-Robo Tweet Super Smash Bros." width="544" height="659" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</div>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since we got that beautiful tweet of Chibi-Robo on fire, he has become the meme that we never knew we wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first teaser trailer for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo Switch, that great Smash ball of fire instantly reminded us of Chibi-Robo, so the lovable robot just just seems like a perfect fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do we think that it’d be hilarious, but you can also imagine his moveset with his extension cord as a whip; he could use it in the same way that Simon Belmont would.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Waluigi</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1557" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1557" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1557" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Waluigi.png?resize=900%2C506" alt="Waluigi Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="506" data-recalc-dims="1" />
    <p id="caption-attachment-1557" class="wp-caption-text">Credit Gizmodo</p>
</div>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come on, we all knew this one was coming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waluigi has been a fan favourite ever since his appearance in Mario Tennis on the Nintendo 64. His wacky antiques and underutilized potential leads him to be an obvious inclusion in the Super Smash Bros. roster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if we can’t get him in Super Smash Bros., then why not make an actual Waluigi game? I’d buy that.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waaah</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sorry, that was terrible.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Geno</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1558" src="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Geno.jpg?resize=900%2C506" alt="Geno Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="506" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We loved seeing Geno make it into </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a Mii skin, but we want the real thing damn it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite only appearing in a very small amount of Nintendo games, fans will never forget the Star Being from Star Road that helped Mario and his gang save the Mushroom Kingdom in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a whole arsenal attacks that they could use from his spell attacks, we’re sure that Sakurai could think of something. Also considering that Square-Enix technically own the rights to him… we got Cloud, so why not Geno? </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Decidueye</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1559" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1559" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1559" src="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Decidueye.jpg?resize=900%2C506" alt="Decidueye Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="506" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</div>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pokémon characters have been a mainstay in the Super Smash Bros. franchise ever since the first instalment on the Nintendo 64. What with Pokémon trainer in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Greninja and Charizard in the most recent release, we have a feeling that the Pokémon company will want to include another character from their most recent generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decidueye just comes across as a perfect fit for Super Smash Bros. with his bow and arrow, as well as his wings for great aerial movement. He was certainly my favourite Alolan final starter evolution of out the three.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Spring Man/Ribbon Girl</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1560" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1560" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1560" src="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arms-Spring-Man-Ribbon-Girl.jpg?resize=900%2C506" alt="Arms Spring Man Ribbon Girl Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="506" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arms-Spring-Man-Ribbon-Girl.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arms-Spring-Man-Ribbon-Girl.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arms-Spring-Man-Ribbon-Girl.jpg?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arms-Spring-Man-Ribbon-Girl.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem like we’re cheating here with two characters, but we believe that any representation of Nintendo’s newest IP should be an instant inclusion. Super Smash Bros. has been known for introducing franchises to fans who may not have known of their existence (quite like Fire Emblem for us in the west). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite selling over one million copies, Nintendo doesn’t appear to be satisfied with how Arms has been selling. So we think that this one is a no-brainer, and what better to do that than to include their main characters Spring Man and/or Ribbon Girl? I mean, they’re already fighting characters, so we think that they’d be a perfect fit. And besides, that grapple would be amazing!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Shantae</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1566" style="width: 951px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1566" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1566" src="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shantae.jpg?resize=900%2C507" alt="Shantae Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="507" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shantae.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shantae.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shantae.jpg?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shantae.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</div>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Way Forward have a strong relationship with Nintendo, and considering Shantae has been on Nintendo systems since the Game Boy Color, we’re surprised that Shantae has been added to the roster already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shantae’s moveset in her games pretty much sum up how she would play in Super Smash Bros.. Considering that her new outing in Shantae ½ Genie Hero expanded her repertoire with the ability to shapeshift into a variety of animals, it seems like a perfect fit. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Shovel Knight</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1562" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1562" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1562" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shovel-knight.jpg?resize=900%2C507" alt="Shovel Knight Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="507" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shovel-knight.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shovel-knight.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shovel-knight.jpg?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shovel-knight.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</div>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans have been clambering for Shovel Knight to make his appearance in Super Smash Bros. ever since the shovel-wielding knight made his way onto Nintendo consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shovel Knight would be a perfect fit for Super Smash Bros. as his moveset would be quite similar to Link’s (but without the boomerang and bombs). He could also use his down-B move to bounce from player-to-player using his shovel.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Rex</span></h2>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1563" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1563" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1563" src="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rex.jpg?resize=900%2C505" alt="Rex Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="505" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rex.jpg?w=600&ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Rex.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</div>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got Shulk from the original </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xenoblade Chronicles</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U & Nintendo 3DS</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so why not Rex from the sequel? With similar moves to Shulk with his sword and Art abilities, Rex would be a perfect fit for the roster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xenoblade Chronicles 2 has been an unprecedented success for the Xeno series, selling over one million copies on the Switch within its first month of release. Not only that, but Masahiro Sakurai personally praised the sequel on it’s sprawling world, unique story and rich soundtrack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, just picture his final smash as Pyra and Mythra appear to inflict major Aegis-style damage on his enemies – I’m just picturing it in my mind right now… it’s glorious!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Banjo-Kazooie</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-1567" src="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Banjo-Kazooie.jpg?resize=900%2C506" alt="Banjo-Kazooie Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="506" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Banjo-Kazooie.jpg?w=1600&ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Banjo-Kazooie.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Banjo-Kazooie.jpg?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Banjo-Kazooie.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Banjo-Kazooie.jpg?resize=1300%2C731&ssl=1 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Banjo and Kazooie back on a Nintendo console would be a dream come true, and if we can’t have a whole new game, we’d be just as happy with the inclusion of him in Smash (actually that’s a lie, bring back Banjo-Kazooie, Rare!). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phil Spencer has even gone on record saying that he would like to see the bear and bird in Nintendo’s fighting series and that he’s always happy to work with Nintendo.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1572" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phil-Spencer-Tweet-Banjo.png?resize=900%2C662" alt="Phil Spencer Tweet Banjo in Super Smash Bros." width="900" height="662" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phil-Spencer-Tweet-Banjo.png?w=910&ssl=1 910w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phil-Spencer-Tweet-Banjo.png?resize=300%2C221&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phil-Spencer-Tweet-Banjo.png?resize=768%2C565&ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We even saw Master Chief and Banjo-Kazooie skins in Minecraft on the Nintendo Switch, so there shouldn’t be any licensing issues. Please Nintendo and Microsoft, play nice and make it happen… for the fans.</span></p>
<p> </p>
