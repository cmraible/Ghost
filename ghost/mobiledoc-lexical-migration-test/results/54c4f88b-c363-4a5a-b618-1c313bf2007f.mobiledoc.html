<hr>
<p>Let us tell you the story of a man who, in 2014, built a massive extension onto his house to house what would later be known as 'Britain's best man cave.' Originally this 10,000 project was said to hold a bowling alley, a casino, a bar, and many other personal luxuries. But, of course, it isn't uncommon for people to want to live it up a little bit when they get some money, and there really is nothing wrong with the idea. The only catch was that the homeowner never cleared the construction project with the city, and as such, a legal battle ensued. Eventually, the court gave him until March 10, 2022, to tear the extension off of his house, and, needless to say, he is royally pissed.</p>

<p>We can empathize with this man in a sense, as it really doesn't seem fair to let other people decide what you're allowed to do with your own home. However, the law is the law, and if the homeowner refuses, he will face serious jail time, which puts him between a rock and a hard place. Ever since the forceful removal of his beloved man cave, the wealthy accountant has been on a quest for revenge and even going as far as to take it out on his neighbors. Residents of the neighborhood have complained that the man has taken to the streets in a boastful show of rebellion with his classic car collection.</p>

<p>You won't be hard-pressed to find a beautiful or exciting vehicle in this neighborhood as the owner has simply resorted to parking them in the street. Some of his favorite parking spaces included in front of his neighbor's houses and across their driveways. Some residents have described the man as "The neighbor from Hell," which honestly sounds like a fitting description. This is a tricky case because, on the one hand, it does feel unfair that he should have to submit to the whims of someone else if he wants to build onto his home; however, he's also a bit of a jerk by needlessly blocking his neighbors into their houses. We want to know what you guys think on this topic, is this man justified in his anger?</p>
