The idea is that the raised dots will make performing burnouts and donuts more difficult and so kids will go elsewhere to have lawless fun. We’re not entirely sure this will actually solve the problem but applaud cities for at least trying to combat street takeovers."

While the city is waiting to see the long-term effect, the mayor says she’s been receiving fewer phone calls from citizens reporting street takeover events in the city."

These sorts of measures work great for respectful, law-abiding people but for those who like to break the law they’re more like a challenge than a deterrence. If the Botts’ Dots become more common, we imagine these kids will either find a way to adapt to them or figure out how to hold their events in other spaces since they seem pretty determined to live lawlessly."
