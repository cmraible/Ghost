The Hellcats in particular seem to have mastered the art of big smokey burnouts and hard-hitting acceleration. However, there has always been one drawback to the current generation of Chargers. That would be the lack of a manual transmission option. We understand "

Seeing that the exclusion of a manual transmission seems to contradict that message, this builder decided to take matters into his own hands to better compliment the brand's image. "

Under the hood sits the famous 707 horsepower 6.2-liter Supercharged Hellcat V8 which has now been modified to push out a ridiculous 850 horsepower. However, while the high power output is impressive, the thing that makes this car special is how that power is transferred. Namely, through a six-speed manual transmission pulled directly out of a Hellcat Challenger. Most of the performance parts were taken from a Hellcat Challenger. "
