With a regretful amount of time on his hands, he finds himself with a few mentors to choose from, and a choice of how to specialise his skills. The choice to become a brigand, a rogue, or a sorcerer is yours."

The graphics, audio design, environments, puzzle design and more all scream the classic Sierra feel that the developers aimed to achieve. Fans nostalgic for that type of game will feel right at home at the helm. The developers even included a digital instruction manual at the beginning of the game to further their commitment to this aesthetic. "

The Path of the Brigand will have the player take a more brute force approach, The Path of the Rogue focuses on a more subtle and stealthy touch and finally, The Path of the Sorcerer shows a more mystical side of the game. This choice is pivotal to how you approach puzzles and combat and is felt throughout most of the game. "

No hint system is present, companion character to give you a tip or anything like this. In the digital era where a walkthrough is a google search away, this isn’t anything egregious, but I’m personally of the opinion that no game should require a walkthrough to enjoy. Classic fans of these games will feel undaunted in the face of this, but players that have grown up with anything Nintendo 64 or newer might find themselves frustrated. "

The better examples seem to have been cast by inexperienced talent that don’t seem to know how to emote properly for voice work, while the worst examples are not only bad actors but also had bad recording environments. One pair of particularly egregious examples are the two proprietors of the general goods store who sound like they recorded their lines in a bathroom. The humour, especially from the game’s narrator, is exceptionally juvenile. Potty humour and unimaginative fourth wall breaks are aggravatingly common and it’s a shame considering that the game sets out to tell a serious story. "

For those that buy this game, I would make two suggestions: save often and play in handheld mode."
