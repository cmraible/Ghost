I was wrong.\n\nThe staggered departure from London, with many people heading home from 4pm onwards seemed to have take the pressure off, and the streets were busy without being packed. As I approached London Bridge station, it was getting positively quiet.\n\nCongratulations to Transport For London for getting the buses and trains running again so quickly.\n\n\n"
