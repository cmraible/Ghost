The base is very solid, the message is important and what parts are good are indeed VERY good. It’s just a shame that it didn’t push its gameplay a little further forward. It is an excellent short story and a stunning visual experience, but just short of a truly fulfilling gaming experience. Although, I would still recommend the game for those that are in the mood for something short and sweet."
