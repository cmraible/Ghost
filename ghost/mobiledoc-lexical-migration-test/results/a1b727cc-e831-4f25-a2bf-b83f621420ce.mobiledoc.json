This time around, it’s anticipated to net somewhere between $5 million and $7 million when it makes its return to RM Sotheby’s Monterey event this August. That is quite the drop in value over the past nine years, but perhaps that means the new owner will be getting quite the deal. After all, a car like this guarantees admittance into some of the most prestigious concours events around the world, so some might say it’s a small price to pay for that level of access."
