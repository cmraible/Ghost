<p><a href="https://www.mecum.com/auctions/monterey-2022/collections/ferrari-prototype-collection/">Ferraris are</a> utterly amazing vehicles, with a rich racing and competition history to back up the sexy swooping lines of the models. These cars are all made to be works of art, that can track down anything out there. Having a Ferrari is a major bragging right, but if you take it a step further and get a prototype to add to your collection, there’s no one-upping your stable! At the upcoming Mecum auction at Monterey, a collection of Ferrari prototypes will be crossing the auction block, which would you choose?</p>

<p>This car is the perfect answer to that question as it combines design cues from some of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ferrari-collector-laferrari-aperta/">Ferrari's</a> most significant automobiles with what could be called the most iconic engine of its generation. Clearly, this would likely produce some ridiculous results on the track and the showroom floor, but no one could have predicted how good the car would really be. Partially this was due to the out-of-this-world styling, which slightly resembles models like the Enzo while still keeping its originality and signature qualities.
