<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/chevy-camaro-production/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> was once described as “a small vicious animal that eats Mustangs” and throughout its long life of production it has almost always held up to that standard. Now fast-forward 55 years and we have a predicament. While the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-production-again/">Camaro</a> has always been a powerhouse of a car, the stock versions of this American legend are no longer able to keep up with today’s competition. This has led many Camaro lovers to bring their skills to the table in the form of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/part-2-coolest-restomods/">restomods</a>. These wild restorations have resulted in some of the coolest Camaros to ever be spotted and today's example, this 1969 Camaro, is no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Under the hood of this high-performance powerhouse is an incredible <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ls-powered-vehicles-on-motorious/">Chevrolet LS3</a> 427-cid crate engine. That insane power plant is pushing out a ridiculous 630 horsepower through a 6-speed T56 manual transmission. The back wheels are sent spinning with the help of a Ford 9” rear end and the Speedtech suspension combines perfectly with the Wilwood brakes to make a great handling car. Deep dish rear wheels give the car a very “muscle car” presence and the 325 tires have just enough meat on them to give the car good grip.</p>
<p>Possibly the greatest piece of this high-power pony car is the exhaust note. A Black Widow Venom 250 exhaust system accompanies the enormous engine with 3” stainless steel pipes which perfectly accent the unique sound of a cammed GM small block. The interior is described by the owner as “deluxe”. The seats and steering wheel, however, give off the feel of a true race car. As this wicked ride rips through the streets of LA all that can be seen in its wake is smoke. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8VpwaQv2rI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
