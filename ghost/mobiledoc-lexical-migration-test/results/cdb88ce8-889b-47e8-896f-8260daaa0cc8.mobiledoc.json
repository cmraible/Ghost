After a complete frame-off restoration, this iconic America classic looks as fresh as it did when it left the showroom in 1964. Its pale yellow color scheme might not make it the most vibrant Impala, especially considering how many are customised, but the factory shade works will with its decorative chrome work. Appearing in near mint condition in its photographs, this Chevy has to be one of the best presented we’ve seen in a while."
