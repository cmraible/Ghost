Those fine details you see everywhere not only makes this car a blast to drive, they’re a calling card to similarly-minded gearheads. As you can see in the photos, it starts with most of the exterior trim pieces being shaved off, including the door handles. That means almost no chrome, but the white paint does have a nice shine. Stickers on the quarter windows help give a more race-inspired look, although some vinyl decals down the sides of the car would punch things up even more."

While it has some niceties like the red door panels and dash with chrome trim pieces, a modern sound system with CD player, plus cupholders between the front seats, removable Lexan windows, other details are more for the track.  Race seats up front, five-point harnesses, a roll cage, aftermarket steering wheel, and large tach mounted on the dash are clear indications this was meant to see some track action."

Letting the engine exhale quickly are custom fender well headers  and side pipes, which you can see peeking out by the door hinges. A trick shifter gives you control of the PowerGlide two-speed automatic transmission, which sends power to the 3.59 rear. Modern shocks plus rear leaf springs with traction bars and a Vega steering box make for solid handling. Despite its race-worthy qualities, this Mercury is still tame enough to cruise on Main Street. A custom fuel cell sits in the trunk along with a few gas cans since this car wasn’t built for efficiency but performance."
