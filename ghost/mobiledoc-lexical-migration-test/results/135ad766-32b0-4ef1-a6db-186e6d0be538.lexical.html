<p>Chevrolet changed the course of history in 1955 and revamped their brand with the introduction of the newly redesigned <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/616/1955-chevrolet-belair?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">Bel Air</a>. It featured an all new, almost futuristic look that had the ability to make the average American feel as though they were driving a much more expensive Cadillac. Available as a hardtop, convertible, or Nomad wagon the new <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/616/1955-chevrolet-belair?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">Chevrolet</a> was truly a car for everyone. So much so that Chevy ended up garnering a whopping 44-percent of the low-priced market segment.</p>

<p>One of the biggest selling <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/616/1955-chevrolet-belair?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">points for the new Tri-Five</a> was a true game changer - the Chevy small block V8 engine. This 265-cid V8 engine was rated at 162-horsepower, or 180-horsepower when equipped with the optional power package. Though the new engine raised the bar for performance oriented buyers, it wasn’t all about horsepower. It also allowed for the use of an all new 12-volt electrical system which brought even more luxuries to one of the most popular cars of the 1950s.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/616/1955-chevrolet-belair?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">Tri-Five lives on</a>. It is not too uncommon to see them driving down the modern road and there hasn’t been a car show short of at least one example since that very first year. Unfortunately, the V8 engine that made its debut in 1955 quickly caught the attention of hot rodders and finding one of these beautiful cars unmodified in an original looking trim can be difficult.</p>
