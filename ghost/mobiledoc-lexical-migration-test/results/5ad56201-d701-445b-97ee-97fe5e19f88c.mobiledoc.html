<p>Few cars are as breathtaking as a Cadillac from the 1930s and 1940s, and this stunning <a href="https://www.grautogallery.com/vehicles/7933/1940-cadillac-series-60?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">1940 Cadillac Sixty Special</a> shows why.

<p>As alluring and luxurious as Cadillac's Series 60 was, designers wanted to create an even more luxurious sedan, which resulted in the Sixty Special being introduced in 1938. This name was used from its introduction until 1976 before making a comeback from 1987 until 1993. Among these first-generation Sixty Special models, the major differences from the Series 60 include a longer wheelbase and a roofline and door design aimed at mimicking the look of a convertible. Even this car's two-tone silver-over-grey paint job intended to make the top look removable.</p>
<p>Powering this big Caddy is a 346 CID V8 and three-speed manual transmission to provide a smooth, luxurious ride. The listing says that this car may have undergone a restoration with the car's previous owner (five years ago), and while not confirmed, that would definitely explain the amazing condition this car is in. Even from underneath, this Cadillac is surprisingly clean and solid. The listing also says that Cadillac built 17,900 of these first-gen Sixty Specials (1938-1941), but it would be hard to believe that many are in much better shape than this one.</p>
