A grandfather is telling a bedtime story to his grandson about the cloud that traveled across the land to a place where it could rain on whomever they want, whenever they want - A magical place called ‘Seattle’. My comment on the story is that it’s somewhat unnecessary. As stated in the gameplay section, it consists of a lot of short mini-game levels that are disjointed and unrelated to one another. This story comes up in a scarce few cutscenes that serves more to interrupt the gameplay to force a story that doesn’t even need to be there. ",

While there is fun to be had, there is no challenge, intrigue or much of anything to compliment the fun to elevate the game past what it feels like, being a WarioWare wannabe. There are attempts at humor throughout the game but for me personally, they don’t always connect. The humor can range from jabs at the games industry like criticizing the abundance of micro transactions, to references to memes and pop culture. The issue I take with it is that the humor can come off as whiney and some of the references are already outdated (for example, a ‘hide your kids, hide your wife’ reference). Overall, I feel that this game would have been better suited as a mobile app due to its sheer simplicity in game design.",
