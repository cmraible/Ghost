They’re also inspiring people to spontaneously hold one-car sessions, like a guy who used a Dodge Challenger Hellcat to do some smoky donuts in a busy stadium parking lot in Houston, Texas. That eventually led to a chase and police shooting."

That cop feared for his life, so he pulled out his gun and fired a few rounds at the muscle car as it barreled toward him.
