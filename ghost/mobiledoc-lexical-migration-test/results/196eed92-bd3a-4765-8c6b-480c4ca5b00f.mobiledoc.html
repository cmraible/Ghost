<hr>
<p>In all, Roger Mears won twenty World Off-Road Championships, five Pikes Peak International Hill Climbs, two HDRA/SCORE series titles, a Mickey Thompson Stadium Series Truck crown, and four Baja 1000 wins. In 1981, he was awarded this <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/662/1981-amc-jeep-cj7-laredo">Jeep CJ7 Laredo</a> for excellently presenting the off-road <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/662/1981-amc-jeep-cj7-laredo">capabilities of Jeep</a> vehicles in the Baja 1000. </p>

<p>While most people would probably be <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/662/1981-amc-jeep-cj7-laredo">happy with the CJ7</a> in its stock form, Roger was once quoted as saying “More horsepower equals more fun. There’s nothing more fun than that — except more horsepower!” And it was this mindset that made this incredible vehicle even more so incredible. Roger immediately delivered the CJ7 to Tom Strong to be customized which resulted in this one of a kind piece of automotive racing history.</p>
