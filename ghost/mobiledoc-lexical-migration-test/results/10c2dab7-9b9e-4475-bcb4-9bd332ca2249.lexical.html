<h2 id="reappraising-journalists-on-social-media">Reappraising journalists on social media</h2>
<p>Twitter can be an exhausting place to be. </p>
<p>Journalists have been sucked into the competitive attention-seeking behaviour that passes for discourse there, and the consequences are playing out in politics and in trust levels in the media. A discussion is restarting about <em>how</em> journalists should be behaving. We talked about pretty much nothing else a decade ago, but the consensus reached then is breaking down. </p>
<p>And I'm very much of the mind that it is ripe for reappraisal. </p>
<p>But there are dangers to this process, as Chris Sutcliffe points out:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2020/06/18/objectivity-vs-transparency-let-journalists-be-opinionated-on-social/">

            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Objectivity vs. transparency: Let journalists be opinionated on social</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">Bias is consistently cited as a reason for lack of trust. in the media. And it’s clear that a vast array of newspapers’ target audiences value objectivity.</div>

<p>Chris concludes his piece thus:</p>
<blockquote>Papering over the cracks by hiding the opinions the public knows we hold anyway is a sop to an impossible ideal. Instead of obfuscating them and squirreling them away, we should be loud, proud – and completely transparent.</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I agree completely. My problem is that both Chris's approach, and the "just shut them up" view, both ignore the complexity inherent in the journalism market. </p>
<p>For example, there is a sense of triumphalism in this <em>Guido Fawkes</em> piece on Sky News asking its journalists to be more neutral on social media. </p>

            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Sky Presenters’ Tweeting Wings Clipped - Guido Fawkes</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">John Ryley, the Head of Sky News, has emailed everyone in the newsroom laying down the law on tweeting: 1. Tweeting should be confined to genuine</div>

<p>One gets the sense that the <em>Guido</em> team are more pleased that a set of voices they perceive as being politically opposed to them are being hushed, rather than satisfied that the requirement on broadcasters to be impartial is being adhered to. </p>
<p>The <em>Guido</em> team are unashamedly partisan — more so now than in the past, in fact — and there is no restriction on them being so. If you told <a href="https://twitter.com/tomhfh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tom Harwood</a> to keep his opinions to himslef - would there be anything left? </p>
<p>This is one major challenge. When journalists from a part of media legally required to be impartial mix with those with no such restriction, the competition for attention is far from a fair fight. </p>
<p>Journalism is, of course, a broad church. We have opinion columnists, whose very role is to be opinionated. The clue is in the job title. We have genuinely expert journalists, who have worked in fields for years or decades and whose opinion is worth hearing — and valuable. Asking these groups not to express opinions is problematic. </p>
<p>However, if you're a mainstream news reporter, aiming at some measure of objectivity in your work, it's worth considering the degree to which blatant expression of partisan views impacts on both your ability to do your job well, and on readers' trust in your reporting. Getting sources and developing contacts is harder if you are seen as partisan, and thus you risk falling into a self-created filter bubble that builds systematic bias into your reporting. And the very people who <em>need</em> to read your reporting might well choose to ignore it because of your displayed bias.</p>
<p>I don't think there's a simple, easy answer here. And that's why I think the conversation is worth having. </p>
<h2 id="say-your-tweet">Say your Tweet</h2>
<p>Oh, look. A shiny new tool I can't play with yet. Twitter is experimenting with a number of changes to its platform, including limiting who can reply to your posts, and now audio tweets. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html">

            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Your Tweet, your voice</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">We’re testing a new feature that will add a more human touch to the way we use Twitter – your very own voice. Some people can now Tweet with audio on iOS.</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://blog.twitter.com/etc/designs/blog-twitter/public/img/apple-touch-icon-153x153.png" alt><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Maya Patterson ‎mayagpatterson‎ Staff Product Designer</span></div>

<p>These were both introduced a while back, but I don't have either of these features yet, alas, so haven't been able to explore and write about them. But I am also saddened that we've fallen to the place where the first reaction of many people to the audio tweet is "how will this be used for abuse?" </p>
<p>That's a question that has to be asked. But I'd also like to see some playful experimentation with what little snippets of audio can bring to the experience. The voice conveys more emotion than pure text, after all. And that might help bring some context back into discussions. </p>

<p>Like many people, I'm profoundly concerned about the future of many art and performance venues. A concern for an audience of plants is both surreally beautiful - and a reminder of the experiences denied to many of us right now. </p>
