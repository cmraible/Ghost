Even more, the engine is topped with a four-barrel Holley carburetor that sits atop a polished aluminum intake manifold. Shifting power down to the rear wheels and twisting a limited-slip differential and Spicer axle shafts is a 5-speed ZF manual transaxle housed in a polished case. A new high-torque starter was installed to prepare the car to sell. The car was dyno-tested in 1994 where its best run produced 393-horsepower at 6,000-rpm and 366 lb/ft of torque at 4,250-rpm. ",
