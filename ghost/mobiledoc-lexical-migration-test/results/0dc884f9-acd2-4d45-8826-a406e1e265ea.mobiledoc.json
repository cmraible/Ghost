With just over 90,000 original kilometers (around 56,000 miles), this rally racer is beautiful with its Olympe Blue Metallic paint job and orange vinyl with cloth interior. There is some slight wear on this Renault and it had a repaint in the 1990s, but overall this is an all-original example of a very rare and desirable race-bred car."

In addition to the added power and balance, early examples of the R5 Turbo (like chassis no. 636) shaved weight from the body with aluminum on the roof, door and rear hatch."
