<hr>
<p>It might be that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/old-hemi-fire-up-home/">Vice Grip Garage</a> has finally bit off more than it can chew with a dead 1974 Saab Sonett III. We’ve seen the YouTuber <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/resurrecting-1972-chevelle/">resurrect all kinds of cars</a> most people would just load onto a trailer and tow home. He seems to get a big kick out of driving these neglected, forgotten rides <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/abandoned-c3-corvette/">out of their grave</a>, but when it comes to this Saab <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dead-chevy-bel-air-brought-back/">things are a bit different</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Someone already killed a Dodge Durango Hellcat. See the damage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/dead-dodge-durango-hellcat/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Right off the bat, he admits he’s owned this car for some time. That alone should tell you this is going to be a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/dead-dodge-durango-hellcat/">challenge</a>, because the guy usually gets such vehicles running almost immediately and drives them home, so why didn’t he do that with this Swede?</p>

<p>There’s also the rarity factor, which can make getting replacement parts a frustrating endeavor. Only 2,483 of these cars were made, at least according to this guy’s count. We’re not Saab experts, but that sounds about right to us. The point is that you don’t run into one of these very often and they can seem a little tricky for most people to work on. However, if you know the eccentricities of Swedish cars, perhaps you could revive something like this. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>Speaking of weird Swedish engineering, this thing has a V4 engine. We’re betting you haven’t worked on one of those ever. If you have, congratulations, because most people these days don’t even know such a thing has ever existed.</p>

<p>This video is especially long for Vice Grip Garage, coming in at over an hour. That along should indicate this isn’t going to be some easy project. Considering some of the absolute junk heaps we’ve seen him successfully bring back in short order, the fact he struggles with this Saab should tell you a lot.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxqQiWejfBw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
