The 63-year-old driver, Franz Jules, thankfully survived the crash and miraculously nobody inside the building was hurt. That’s especially lucky since there were multiple events going on at the time, including a junior volleyball tournament."

The man claims the brakes on the luxury electric vehicle went out as he was driving down the highway. He pulled off onto a surface street, blew through a red light, then cannonballed through a set of glass doors, the car finally coming to rest in a hallway."

In fact, last year NHTSA released the findings of an investigation into such reports, attributing them to driver error. Witnesses to the crash reportedly told police the Tesla appeared to be accelerating before blowing through the red light. They also claim there were zero signs the driver hit the brakes."
