<hr>
<p>Thanks to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">coronavirus restrictions across North America</a>, many of us are longing for the days when we can go back to the track and smell the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-dodge-dart-demon/">sweet aroma of roasting tires</a>. While we can’t deliver the full experience, we can bring to you a video of a new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1400hp-carbon-fiber-dodge-demon-from-skeedkore-selling-for-170k/">Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</a> taking on a range of classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">American muscle cars</a> at the drag strip.</p>

<p>You’ll notice in the video most of the challenging cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellephant-swapped-demon-quarter-mile/">are pretty heavily modified</a>. Before you whine that it’s not a fair match, keep in mind the whining the Demon is doing comes from a supercharger bolted up to the 6.2-liter V8 pumping out a mighty 808-horsepower, rocketing the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">Mopar master</a> from 0-60 in 2.3 seconds. The other cars need the extra help, trust us.</p>
<p>The secret to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/someone-abandoned-this-1971-dodge-demon-sizzler/">Dodge Demon isn’t just raw power</a>, although that certainly helps. Dodge loaded the cars with carefully-designed features aimed specifically at getting down a drag strip as quickly as possible. Among them is the Demon Crate, which includes 18-inch front wheels and an engine controller designed to squeeze the full potential out of the engine or 840-hp. Lightweighting abounds, there’s an advanced Launch mode which cuts fuel off to cylinders as needed, plus the transmission has a shorter 3.09:1 final-drive ratio designed for drag racing. The car can run on 100-plus-octane fuel with the Demon Crate, too.</p>

<p>Of course, all that technology won’t correct for driver error. If you watch this video and are a Mopar fan, you might be screaming at the driver as he hesitates and makes other mistakes, especially against that super-quick Ford Mustang. Most of the Demon’s runs don’t get near the 9.65-second quarter-mile time Dodge advertised, showing that skill is definitely part of the equation.</p>
<p>Sadly, for those who didn’t scoop up one of the 3,300 Demons there’s no building a clone car. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">As we covered before</a>, Fiat Chrysler has a system in place to keep those Demon-specific parts from being purchased by anyone who isn’t a confirmed owner.</p>
