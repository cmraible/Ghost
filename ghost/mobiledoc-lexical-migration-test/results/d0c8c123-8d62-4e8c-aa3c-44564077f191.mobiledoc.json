The fights (especially blaster based fights) feel so realistic and satisfying. It took a little getting used to but once you get into the flow, it feels intuitive and responsive. The levelling and perk system is just complicated enough to satisfy RPG aficionados but not so much so that it alienates more casual players. I found myself using the auto-level feature for all my party members and never noticed any severe detriment in doing so. The parties feel like a classic RPG: different characters have different skills that can help you progress and defeat even the most formidable enemies. It’s essentially an expansive "

Depending on the actions you take and how you respond to dialogue prompts, the story can be affected and can result in multiple endings. The idea of a gradient of Light/Dark is an interesting view of the binary idea expressed in the films but also a staple of RPGs. This framework also aids in immersion and adds replay value. I’ll definitely be doing multiple runs in order to get the full experience, which is a testament to how good this game is, since I usually delete games I review immediately after I submit them. This is the best game I’ve reviewed all year, even though it’s old enough to vote."
