<hr>
<p>Chris Netterville of College Station, Texas woke up Sunday morning to find his beloved <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-wagon-hits-200-mph/">Cadillac CTS-V</a> missing. While his initial reaction was to wonder if it had been towed, the reality was it had been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-wreck-nba-lamborghini/">stolen and crashed</a> on the highway, putting another driver <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-delivery-driver-attacked/">in the hospital</a>. Now he’s trying to make sense of the crime, especially since the wrecked car had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jackass-stars-bentley-stolen/">tremendous sentimental value</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Watch a modified CTS-V hit 200 mph on the track <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-wagon-hits-200-mph/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Netterville originally purchased the CTS-V because his late friend Brandon Strope had one. After testing out his friend’s car, Netterville fell in love. After Strope died from a heart condition, Netterville decided his Cadillac would be a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-most-heartbreaking-stories/">rolling memorial</a> to the man.</p>

<p>According to police, Curtis Owens, 20, of Hearne was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/speeding-13-year-old-kills-dodge-challenger-driver/">taken into custody at the crash site</a>. He has multiple outstanding warrants for other crimes. What charges he might be facing in connection to the stolen Cadillac haven’t been revealed.</p>
<p>What makes this story even more heart-wrenching is the fact Netterville didn’t buy just any Cadillac CTS-V. After saving up his money throughout high school, at the age of just 19 he bought a Black Diamond Edition car. There aren’t many of those around, so replacing the vehicle would be difficult if not impossible. According to Cadillac, the distinct tri-coat black paint is embedded with SpectraFlair Bright Silver pigment, which uses aluminum flakes encapsulated in magnesium fluoride, which is glass-like, giving the paint an extra sparkle.</p>

<p>Other unique appointments were included on the Cadillac CTS-V Black Diamond Edition cars, like 19-inch Satin Graphite wheels, yellow Brembo brake calipers, and Midnight Sapele wood trim for the interior.</p>
<p>“It’s heartbreaking man. I worked my butt off for it in high school and saved up as much money as I could and bought my dream car, and it just sucks to see something you worked for so hard gone in seconds,” said Netterville.</p>
<p>This serves as yet another reminder that if you own a special car you should take extra precautions to secure it. This could involve garaging it at night, installing surveillance cameras, using an aftermarket alarm, hiding a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/kill-switches-new-cars/">kill switch</a>, getting a watch dog, etc. Make your ride less enticing to criminals or you might end up in a similar situation.</p>
