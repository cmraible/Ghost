          ", the newer version of Godzilla can be modified to tremendous heights, especially if you pour in a ton of resources. That’s exactly what’s happened with this 2009 Nissan GT-R. Thanks to a long, long list of modifications, the turbocharged V6 is pushing a mighty 2,000-horsepower. Of course, all the power in the world does you no good unless you can get it to all 4 wheels, but the 6-speed DCT seems to do a great job helping manage that. Plus, with all-wheel drive, Godzilla has an advantage to hooking up to get an early lead."

The most obvious one is the turbocharger the size of a platter (it’s a 98 mm) mounted right up front, well above the hood line. Sitting behind that is a 427ci LSX V8, which we’re sure has all kinds of internal wizardry we can’t see. Thanks to all this, this C6 ‘Vette is putting out a thunderous 1,500-hp. The guy claims if they dial the boost up from 10 psi to 30 it would crank out more like 2,000-hp. Helping transfer all that power to the rear wheels is a 2-speed Powerglide."
