<p>Carroll Shelby is a name all gear heads instantly recognize, and is a name you can’t help but think of when it comes to the GT40. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rare-1968-ford-mustang-gt500kr/">Shelby</a> was a key figure in working with Ford to kick dust in the face of Ferrari at Le Mans. Owning one of the original cars is not an easy job, and restoring one to original condition is even harder - that’s why the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0014-1966-ford-gt40-replica-50th-anniversary-edition/1011472?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">Shelby GT40 85th Commemorative Edition</a> is such an incredible car.

<p>The amazing <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0014-1966-ford-gt40-replica-50th-anniversary-edition/1011472?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">85th Commemorative Edition GT40</a> is an extreme, purpose-built car that stands at only 40-inches tall. This car is so close to the car it immolates that was races in Le Mans and won. It shares roughly 2/3rds of the components, meaning, these parts can be interchanged with the original Mk II. Both of the cars have the same dimensions, same stamped steel roof design, and come in very close to the same weight. Where they differ is in the Commemorative Edition’s much improved electro-galvanized steel used in the body.</p>
