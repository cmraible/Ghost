In stock form the car produced 707-horsepower, so that’s a nice uplift. The team installed a pulley kit, plus upgraded spark plugs as well as fuel injectors. From there, the PCM was unlocked, a custom Petty’s Garage tune was loaded, and a DiabloSport Trinity handheld tuner was included, so you can play further with this amazing machine."

To help with that, this car wears a Petty’s Garage Hellcat strut tower brace, stiffening everything up so you keep the rubber to the road. And upgraded driveshaft also helps put more of that power to the wheels, where it really counts."

Petty’s Garage added a custom rear fascia, truly setting this Hellcat apart from the rest. These are intimidating machines in person, and the black paint job that’s shined to perfection goes perfectly with the in-your-face styling. Gray stripes run from nose to tail, adding a sporty flair to the serious setup."

Add to that the professional upgrades from Petty’s Garage and this is a vehicle you can invest in for the future while having plenty of fun now."
