<p>The SUV market sure has changed a lot since the early days. While there are some similar purposed and looking SUVs in the new car lineups, nothing is quite and cool and rugged and an old school SUV. Here are some of the best examples of the vintage SUV market in the Motorious inventory.</p>

<p>This is an outstanding <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/218324/1991-chevrolet-blazer-k5">1991 Chevy Blazer</a>. New paint on a West Coast solid body is everything you want in a lower mile Blazer and this one is all of that. This is the last year for a Factory Fuel Injected square-body K5 Blazer with a removable top. Just try and find one cleaner. The interior is also in exceptional condition. Just take a look at those underside photos. This Blazer is the definition of no rust. Super clean and just what the Dr. ordered. </p>

The model represents the precursor of more sophisticated SUVs to follow, and close to the end of production of the moniker. This particular example has a 345 cubic-inch engine that's backed by an automatic transmission. It also has power steering, power brakes, 4WD, a removeable hard top, and fresh paint.</p>

<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/219686/1988-jeep-grand-wagoneer">This 1988 Jeep Grand Wagoneer</a> is a very nice and mostly original SUV that spent its life in Montana. It is a two owner Woody with good miles and it has been well-maintained and cared for. It is getting very hard to find these in this kind of condition for a fair price. The body on this Jeep is super clean and straight. There are no rust issues with this truck and we found no rust repair. It is just a nice solid and original body.

<p>Fully-sorted and fully polished, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213779/1977-toyota-land-cruiser-fj43">this trail blazing FJ</a> is one of the toughest and most capable SUVs ever built. A rare medium wheelbase Land Cruiser that presents a better-than-factory appearance, the truck benefitted from a detailed, body-off restoration. During that reboot, solid metal was stripped bare, promptly re-sprayed in quaint Dune Beige pigment and shrouded in a fresh canvas roof. And presently, that Rhino-inspired shell creates a classy, wet-look profile that mixes searing glares with smooth reflections.</p>
