<p>Fraudsters <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/colorado-dealership-theft-spree/">seem to be attracted to exotic supercars</a> like moths to the flame. With taxpayer money <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/georgia-woman-dodge-charger/">being handed out</a> seemingly like it’s candy recently, we’ve seen a fair share of people <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/quarantine-aid-fraud/">trying to game the system</a> so they can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/covid-relief-money-used-cars/">buy some dream cars</a>. However, Mustafa Qadiri of Orange County, California has pulled off one of the loftiest schemes we’ve seen yet, netting an impressive stable of supercars before he was ultimately caught.</p>

<p>The US Attorney L.A. Twitter account posted photos of 3 cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1-9-million-ferrari-seized/">seized by authorities</a>. One is a black Lamborghini Aventador, showing Qadiri wasn’t messing around with anything small like a Huracan. The Italian supercar is sitting in a non-descript garage a charger connected to it and the driver’s door open.</p>
<p>Just as impressive is the Ferrari 488 GTB pictured in a parking lot with a tow truck in front, presumably readying to haul the Italian supercar off. With over 700-horsepower on tap, it’s quite the ride, especially when you didn’t have to pay a red cent for it.</p>

<p>Finally, a black Bentley Continental GT right behind a wrecker is also pictured. Maybe the British luxury coupe was the “reasonable” car purchased with taxpayer dollars for lying low?</p>
<p>According to press release from the United States Attorney’s Office, Central District of California, Qadiri is accused of fraudulently obtaining about $5 million in Payment Protection Program (PPP) loans for a fake business.</p>
<p>Law enforcement arrested Qadiri on the morning of May 7. He’s accused in the federal indictment of claiming to operate 4 Newport Beach-based companies. The only problem is the feds checked and none of those businesses are currently in operation.</p>
<p>Back in May and June of 2020, authorities say Qadiri allegedly submitted false and fraudulent PPP loan applications at 3 different banks. They allege among the information he provided was someone else’s name, Social Security number, and signature.</p>

<p>Not only did the man buy 3 expensive vehicles, he also went on lavish vacations and paid for various personal expenses – all things PPP loan money isn’t supposed to go toward. Along with the Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Bentley, authorities seized $2 million in funds from his bank account.</p>
<p>We’re sure Qadiri thought he got away with his alleged scheme. The man was able to live the good life for about a year, but the long arm of the law caught up with him and now he could end up paying dearly.</p>
