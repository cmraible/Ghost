<p>Doc Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer Parker, the future Mrs. Marty McFly, traveled from 1985 into the future on October 21, 2015. Since the movie's release, people had been waiting for the rear date to arrive. Sadly, flying cars, (real) hover boards and rehydrated Pizza Hut pizzas never came to fruition, but you can always create your own future with one of these cars from the movie with no fear of disrupting the space time continuum.</p>

<p>In the movie, Marty pined for and ended up owning a black 1985 version of this truck, but you can own this red <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/180313/1987-toyota-sr5" rel="nofollow">1987 SR5</a> today through <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Raleigh Classic Car Auctions</a>.

Just like Marty's truck, though, this Toyota is the Xtra Cab model and it has the push bumper and the roll bar with KC Hi-Lites.</p>

<p>Dr. Emmett Brown's personal vehicle was a beige 1949 Packard Custom Eight Convertible that acted as a tow vehicle for the DeLorean as well as the car for Marty to drive Lorraine to the Enchantment Under The Sea dance. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/back-to-the-future-packard" rel="nofollow">original movie car</a> sold for $72,800 earlier this year, but you can buy this Dove Gray <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/177377/1949-packard-custom-eight-touring-sedan" rel="nofollow">1949 Packard Custom Eight Touring Sedan</a> today through <a href="https://www.connorsmotorcar.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Connors Motorcar Company</a>.</p>

<p>The Volkswagen Type 2 only played a supporting role when it comes to cars starring in the BTTF movies, but who could forget the Libyans chasing the DeLorean time machine through the mall parking lot in a blue VW Bus? These vans are probably the hottest of the collector cars on this list right now, and while this example isn't blue, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/179710/1977-volkswagen-type-2-bus" rel="nofollow">'77 Type 2</a> you see here is listed through <a href="https://streetsideclassics.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Streetside Classics</a>.</p>
