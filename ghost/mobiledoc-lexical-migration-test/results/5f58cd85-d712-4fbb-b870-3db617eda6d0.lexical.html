<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to buy things with less or no packaging. It’s currently impossible to do much about this. I am trying to elect left wing candidates who support a Green New Deal. I try to avoid getting plastic bags at all costs. Meanwhile my garage is filling up with plastic bags. There are places that “recycle” them. Do they really?</p>
<p>My questions: in order of environmental damage: plastic bags, plastic other stuff, clothing? And what can we do about it?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><strong>Dear Material Girl,</strong></p>
<p>Like many things in capitalism, plastics are both a scourge upon the earth and almost completely unavoidable. As of 2015, just <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782">9 percent</a> of the plastics ever produced<em></em>had been recycled — 12 percent were incinerated, and 79 percent accumulated in the environment or in landfills, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160524211817.htm">health hazards</a> which in the United States have <a href="http://archive.gao.gov/d48t13/121648.pdf">long</a> been <a href="https://qz.com/939612/race-is-the-biggest-indicator-in-the-us-of-whether-you-live-near-toxic-waste/">overwhelmingly</a> sited in Black and brown communities. To answer your first question, plastics recycling is mostly fake.</p>
<p>A 2020 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled">investigation</a> by NPR and PBS’ <em>Frontline</em> found that the oil industry spent years misleading the public (<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/book/exxon-the-road-not-taken/">sound familiar?</a>) about the viability of plastics recycling as it spawned a generation of toxic petrochemical plants. U.S. oil majors continue to count on those noxious environmental justice disasters — linked to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/welcome-to-cancer-alley-where-toxic-air-is-about-to-get-worse">devastatingly high cancer rates</a> along the Gulf Coast — as a key <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Petrochemical-market-expected-to-grow-276-billion-15936930.php">growth business</a> to help them weather the energy transition that they are still spending <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2021/06/30/exxon-climate-change-undercover/">precious lobbying resources</a> to slow down.</p>
<p>The reasons companies have doubled down on petrochemicals are pretty straightforward: Plastic is made from oil and gas. If people keep using a bunch of plastic, that feeds demand for oil and gas even as more people stop using it to power their homes and get to work. Ipso facto, companies fueled demand for plastic that’s now found everywhere from skincare products to our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time">bloodstream</a>, consequences be damned. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/opinion/sunday/epa-carniogens.html">St. John Parish</a>, Louisiana — located at the epicenter of the petrochemicals build-out — the EPA found that the risk of developing cancer from chemicals given off by industrial facilities is nearly 27 times the national average.</p>
<p>Regarding your second question: Creating a hierarchy for <em>which types</em> of plastics are worse is tricky, as any kind of holistic assessment should probably look at more things than just the fossil fuels flowing into them, the grave health hazards involved in their production and where they end up.</p>
<p>Take fast fashion. A <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57433221">study</a> from the Royal Society for the Arts — a UK-based charity — found that <em>49 percent</em> of clothes from the fast-fashion brands Asos, Boohoo, Prettylittlething and Missguided are made of new plastics. Not great! But such brands also tend to be miserable employers up and down the supply chain. The head-spinning network of contractors and subcontractors that supply some of the world’s biggest brands — many of them in Southeast Asia, employing mostly women — have been the site of <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/garment-workers-strikes-human-cost-of-fashion">militant labor organizing and strikes</a> over low wages and dangerous conditions, highlighted internationally after the 2013 <a href="https://www.racked.com/2018/4/13/17230770/rana-plaza-collapse-anniversary-garment-workers-safety">collapse of a garment factory</a> in Dhaka, Bangladesh, killed 1,132 people.</p>
<p>So what to do? Let’s start with the demand side of the equation. The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA) has laid out a <a href="https://www.no-burn.org/going-zero-waste/">helpful guide</a> for the sorts of changes required to go zero waste, which they define as “a trajectory to avoid waste by ultimately eliminating materials that can not be safely reused, recycled, or composted.” Encouraging changes in personal consumption choices is a part of that process, but so is providing the necessary public infrastructure and supportive state policies at all levels of government that enable people to make those choices.</p>
<p>On the supply side, pushing for accountability from the industry could be another first step. The California Attorney General’s office recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/california-subpoenas-exxon-for-details-on-role-in-plastic-pollution.html">opened an investigation</a> into the fossil fuel industry’s role in growing the planet’s stock of plastic waste, a move that could be copied in other states. Ultimately, fighting plastics pollution and the climate crisis share a common goal: euthanizing the business model of the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>This is all pretty depressing! By way of a palate cleanser, I’d highly recommend treating yourself to Ramin Bahrani’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkbT50O7scc">tender 2009 short film</a><em>Plastic Bag</em>, in which celebrated director Werner Herzog narrates the eponymous petrochemical product’s journey into the unknown over an original score by Sigur Rós.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>I recently was hired into a higher-paying job and I’m trying to think of ethical ways to spend my newfound cash. What do you think are ethical ways to spend extra money? Specific climate-focused ideas would be great, but this answer could depend a lot on the circumstances of one’s life. So if you don’t have specific charities, how would you go about setting priorities, in either a climate-focused way or otherwise?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>A Penny Saved Is a Penny Fraught With Peril on All Sides</p>

<p><strong>Dear Penny Saved,</strong></p>
<p>I’m tempted with a question like this to start listing organizations and service providers I think are doing good work at which you could throw money. But therein lies one of the problems with philanthropy! That is, individual choices should probably play a much smaller role.</p>
<p>If you’re reading <em>The Lever,</em> you probably agree with me that Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are ghouls looking for a tax break and an ego boost from their dubious philanthropic empires, who treat the fact that they’ve gotten obscenely rich off exploitation and intellectual property hoarding as proof they know how to save the world. Meanwhile, their ill-gotten fortunes passively amass money faster than they could possibly spend <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/giving-away-money-well-is-very-hard-the-giving-pledge-turns-10-and-its-signers-are-richer-than-ever-2020-08-08">or donate</a> it.</p>
<p>Yet that basic logic is baked into how we tend to think about charitable giving in the United States. What I mean is that having some extra money and the instinct to make the world a better place almost by default puts you in the position of shopping around for causes.</p>
<p>In places with fairer tax systems, some portion of those funds would likely be taxed to help fund the state benefits, services, and regulations that many activists here in the U.S. are fighting to put in place. (Nobody should need to raise money to perform abortions!) To do so, activists often need to appeal to the wealthy people that have benefited from that system (donors) or staffers at the foundations that they’ve set up over the years.</p>
<p>As no shortage of frustrated organizers have <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-revolution-will-not-be-funded">pointed out</a>, that creates a pretty perverse set of incentives. The arrangement allows wealthy people — many of them perfectly well-intentioned! — power over what issues these groups work on. This state of affairs has been catastrophically evil in some cases, like how John D. Rockefeller III and the Ford Foundation bankrolled efforts to squash the left and destabilize governments across the Global South. On a more mundane level, this means that the campaigns that activists are able to get funded are forced to cater to whatever pet cause has rich liberals riled up at any given point. One moment that might be the climate crisis, the next disinformation.</p>
<p>So let’s take a step back. None of this context is meant to suggest you shouldn’t donate to things you care about! But whether you have some extra cash to throw around or a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/07/24/taylor-swift-folklore-last-great-american-dynasty/">last great American dynasty</a>-type situation, starting with identifying your personal principles and priorities around this stuff is a great way to make donating feel a bit less like trying to be an informed shopper at the social justice mall.</p>
<p>Resource Generation — a network of young people with generational wealth — has developed <a href="https://resourcegeneration.org/social-justice-philanthropy-and-giving/">resources</a> for people with a lot of cash to give. At a smaller scale — which sounds like your situation, Penny — sustaining donations, like donating a set amount of money every month, can be a great way to provide reliable income to groups to help insulate them from the sometimes volatile injections of cash they might get from foundations.</p>
<p>As a general rule, huge nonprofits with hundreds of staff aren’t hard up for cash. You also don’t need to limit yourself to registered nonprofits and charities. Is there a strike going with a solidarity fund that you could support? Are there protesters who need to be bailed out, or a mutual aid fund that is short on cash? Is there a candidate running (especially for a state or local office) who supports a Green New Deal, and has earned endorsements from groups you trust?</p>
<p>If you don’t have extra cash, you could also consider donating time, if you have some of that to spare. For example, why not pick up a door-knocking or phone-banking shift on a campaign near you?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Left Wondering</p>
