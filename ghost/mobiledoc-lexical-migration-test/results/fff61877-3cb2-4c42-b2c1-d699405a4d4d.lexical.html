<p>Good things are happening! Schools are getting into solar energy in a big way, while the health care industry is feeling the heat for its investments in fossil fuels. Meanwhile, a young activist scored a big victory against Idaho’s far right, while a major library just took a stand against banned books. Finally, unionization efforts are spreading, this time to Home Depot stores and a big metro newspaper. </p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em>, available below for supporting subscribers.</p><!--members-only-->

<h3 id="schools-use-solar-power-in-record-numbers">Schools Use Solar Power In Record Numbers</h3>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://generation180.org/brighter-future-2022/#maps">report</a>, the number of U.S. schools using solar power has more than doubled over the last seven years, reaching nearly 8,400 by the end of 2021. This “Brighter Future” report details how solar-powered schools now account for nearly one in every 10 public, independent, and charter K-12 schools, a cohort that together serves more than 6 million students.</p>
<p>This solar expansion can <a href="https://grist.org/energy/schools-are-harnessing-solar-power-in-record-numbers/">cut</a> thousands of dollars from each of the schools’ utility bills. According to Generation180, the clean energy organization behind the report, shifting all of the country’s K-12 schools to 100 percent solar power would slash 60 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.</p>
<h3 id="fossil-fuel-divestment-gains-health-care-allies">Fossil Fuel Divestment Gains Health Care Allies</h3>
<p>During a mass action called <a href="https://www.climateweeknyc.org/">Climate Week NYC 2022</a> this past week, climate activists targeted the country’s most influential medical organization, demanding that it divest from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>As part of the global climate event, representatives from the <em>First, Do No Harm </em>(FDNH) campaign sent more than <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/sign-and-send-the-petition-to-the-national-academy-of-medicine-the-healthcare-sector-must-divest-from-fossil-fuels/">75,000 letters</a> to the National Academy of Medicine ahead of its steering committee meeting, calling on the organization to push for health care divestment from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The FDNH campaign was launched in March by the publication of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2200246?query=TOC&cid=NEJM+eToc%2C+March+10%2C+2022+DM809401_NEJM_Non_Subscriber&bid=867522278"><em>Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector</em></a> in the New England Journal of Medicine, which argues that the health care industry must contend with its financial investments in fossil fuels to actually support people’s health. Major health care institutions, for example, are not among the more than <a href="https://divestmentdatabase.org/">1,500 institutions</a> worldwide that have already committed to fossil fuel divestment. A <a href="https://climatesafepensions.org/first-do-no-harm-75000-nam-letters/">review</a> of more than 1,200 for-profit hospitals revealed wide-ranging investments in fossil fuels. Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest health care plans in the country, had an estimated $2.8 billion invested in oil and gas, while the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York had invested around $1 billion in the sector.</p>
<p>“It’s absurd, and entirely hypocritical, for healthcare institutions to continue to make these investment choices,” noted the FDNH campaign in its petition <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/sign-and-send-the-petition-to-the-national-academy-of-medicine-the-healthcare-sector-must-divest-from-fossil-fuels/">statement</a>. “Hospitals divested from tobacco in the ’90s, and they can — and must — divest from fossil fuels today.”</p>

<p>High school senior Shiva Rajbhandari <a href="https://twitter.com/_Shiva_R/status/1569539660271202304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1569547675674234880%7Ctwgr%5E27bc9d7de9caf1d67252d393a35ddc5c5ebc633d%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2022%2F09%2F13%2Fidaho-boise-school-board-election%2F">won</a> a seat on the school board in Boise, Idaho, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/09/13/idaho-boise-school-board-election/">defeating</a> an incumbent school board trustee, Steve Schmidt, who was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IdahoLibertyDogs/photos/pcb.618899586536964/618899526536970">endorsed</a> by right-wing extremists Idaho Liberty Dogs.</p>
<p>Rajbhandari sees his victory as part of a fight against suppression of discussions regarding race and gender in public schools across the country. “I stand strongly against book bans. Free access to information is the cornerstone of a democratic civil society, and I refuse to back down to extremists. On the school board I will continue to advocate for student dignity and teacher freedom,” he said on <a href="https://twitter.com/_Shiva_R/status/1555669316246257664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1555669316246257664%7Ctwgr%5E27bc9d7de9caf1d67252d393a35ddc5c5ebc633d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2022%2F09%2F13%2Fidaho-boise-school-board-election%2F">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXsYiBRv0qg&t=132s">public hearing</a> last year, Rajbhandari confronted Idaho’s far-right lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, arguing that the state’s taskforce to “Examine Indoctrination in Idaho Education” was targeting a fictitious threat.</p>
<p>“Idaho is at the center of this out-of-state-funded far-right attack to try to undermine schools, with the end goal of actually abolishing public education,” Rajbhandari <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/09/13/idaho-boise-school-board-election/">told</a><em>The</em><em>Intercept</em>.</p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cbooks-unbanned%E2%80%9D">“Books Unbanned”</h3>
<p>The Brooklyn Public Library has <a href="https://www.bklynlibrary.org/books-unbanned">stepped into</a> the fight against the coordinated effort to censor reading materials — most of which are written by Black or LGBTQIA+ authors — for teens in schools and public libraries. The library just launched the Books Unbanned initiative, which offers individuals all over the country, ages 13-21, the opportunity to apply for a free library eCard, granting access to the library’s full eBook collection and learning databases. To apply for a card, email <a>booksunbanned@bklynlibrary.org</a>.</p>
<h3 id="home-depot-workers-petition-to-unionize">Home Depot Workers Petition To Unionize</h3>
<p>This week, 274 Home Depot workers from Northeast Philly are <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/04-RC-303670">organizing</a> to become the company’s first unionized store.</p>
<p>Vincent Quiles, an organizing worker, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/retail/home-depot-union-philadelphia-20220920.html&outputType=app-web-view">told</a><em>The Philadelphia Inquirer </em>that he delivered the workers’ petition to the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that enforces labor relations law, after his store manager refused to accept it in person. According to Quiles, workers are organizing for higher compensation, improved store staffing, and better treatment from upper management.</p>
<p>“Long story short, we got screwed over during the pandemic,” Quiles <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/retail/home-depot-union-philadelphia-20220920.html&outputType=app-web-view">told</a> the <em>Inquirer</em>. “This company made money hand over fist, and we just feel exploited. A lot of times we feel like we’re just a means to an end to make other people a lot of money.”</p>

<h3 id="denver-post-journalists-need-your-help">Denver Post Journalists Need Your Help</h3>
<p><em>Denver Post </em>journalists are organizing for a pay raise, paid parental leave, and increased hiring from communities underrepresented in journalism. You can help in their efforts by sending an email to the <em>Post’s</em> Media News Group executives asking them to invest in their workers <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/denver-post-journalists-need-your-help">here</a>.</p>
<p>“In the past two years, we’ve entered COVID wards, inhaled tear gas at protests, run toward wildfires and asked hard questions of powerful people. We do these things to tell the stories of our community, to keep people informed,” reads their <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/denver-post-journalists-need-your-help">statement</a>. “To continue doing this important work, the job must be sustainable.”</p>
<p>The <em>Post</em> has not received a pay raise from their hedge-fund owner Alden Global Capital since 2016. Alden, known by the <em>Post</em>’s editors as “vulture capitalists,” is a firm <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/16/denver-post-reporters-vs-vulture-capitalist-hedge-fund-alden.html">behind major layoffs</a> across the newspaper industry, and the <em>Post </em>has been protesting their austerity since early summer.</p>
