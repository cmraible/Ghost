<p>There’s also a Volkswagen 15-Window Safari Bus. It’s a pale mint green and cream example with a sunroof.</p>
<p>Creative Rides CEO, Kevin Derrick, offered "This is the second tranche of cars from Uncle Louis' collection. He had 450-odd vehicles in garages upon garages, with about 50 to 60 going on auction come 4 December. What's great is that many of the vehicles have been recommissioned by us and are reasonably good running conditions. Some of the cars have not been seen by public eyes, and only a few people have had the privilege of seeing uncle Louis' collection in the flesh. The auctioned cars will end up on the road. By bringing these unique vehicles to the market, it is a great tribute to Uncle Louis.</p>

<p>"Uncle Louis' collection is vast, and he had the biggest collection of Mercedes-Benz vehicles in South Africa. He was also a lover of American classics and muscle cars. We promise you that the upcoming auction will have an interesting array of cars.”</p>
