Case in point: back on July 29 a suspect who allegedly stole a 2011 Chevy Camaro at gunpoint whipped out his phone and took video of himself in the stolen vehicle. Now, we’re not criminal defense attorneys but we’re pretty sure Saul Goodman’s advice of keeping your mouth shut includes not taking videos of yourself committing a crime."

          "Memphis Police Department didn’t specify how it got the video, but we wouldn’t be surprised to learn the suspect posted it on social media. According to police, the armed robbery took place at a gas station at 3888 Macon Road. After producing a black handgun, the two men told the owner of the Camaro to empty his pockets. They took the keys to the car and the victim’s phone, then used to muscle car to get away. It’s possible the suspect recorded the video on the victim’s phone, which also is just such a genius move."

The second suspect is also a black male, 18-21 years of age, wearing a black hoodie. While those descriptions aren’t great, the video the one suspect took of himself is far better. You can see he appears to have tattoos on his shoulders, neck, hands, and arms."
