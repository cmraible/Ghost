          " Although in the 1970’s there was a plan to replace Porsche’s flagship model with something that would be more appealing to a larger group of people. The 928 featured a powerful V8 engine paired to a manual or automatic transaxle to aid in weight distribution and a 2+2 layout. Though the new model was well received and did eventually draw an avid following, Porsche purists were not sold on the model and instead of replacing the 911, it was added to the lineup. "

Its single owner drove the car an average of less than 2,000 miles per year, always kept the car in a garage when not in use, and took impeccable care of it. With 80,000 miles on the clock, this Porsche 928 is essentially a time capsule. Accompanying the car is 3 keys, all of the original handbooks, and its original tool set. Oh and just in case you were wondering, it drives great."
