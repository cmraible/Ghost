<hr>
<p>Welcome back to Motorious’ <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/motorcycle-monday-1948-indian-chief/">Motorcycle Monday</a>, where we feature interesting two-wheeled rides for your consideration. This time we’re doing something different by presenting not one, not two, but three classic Harley-Davidsons and asking which of them you would buy. That might sound simple enough, but once you see these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/motorcycle/">motorcycles</a>, you’ll understand that it’s not such a straightforward decision.</p>
<p>Without further delay, let’s take a look at the bikes.</p>

<p>First up is a <a href="https://www.bulletmotorsports.com/vehicles/477/1950-harley-davidson-wr-daytona-racer?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1950 Harley-Davidson WR Dayton Racer</a>. Wearing a nice patina, with the exception of some relatively-looking fresh brightwork on the fuel tank and a few other spots, this Harley definitely has that vintage look. Bikes like this one were used to win races in places like Daytona Beach back in the day, capturing the hearts and imaginations of Americans from coast to coast. With 5 miles on the restoration, this bike is ready to rip for plenty of good times.</p>

<p>Next is a <a href="https://www.bulletmotorsports.com/vehicles/479/1947-harley-davidson-deluxe?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1947 Harley-Davidson Deluxe</a>, which the dealer says is a genuine barn find, having been kept out of sight since 1955. That means this Harley is quite original. It also has a well-earned patina which makes the Skyway blue fenders and fuel tank look that much better. While this bike might look like something you’d see in a museum, it can be ridden, thanks the recently rebuilt engine, which also has just 5 miles on it since completion.</p>

<p>Already struggling to figure out which motorcycle is best? It’s not going to get any easier with this <a href="https://www.bulletmotorsports.com/vehicles/478/1941-harley-davidson-wla?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1941 Harley-Davidson WLA</a> in the mix. Yes, this Harley was built to US Army specifications and still wears that telling olive drab paint, plus it comes with leather saddlebags. Like the other two, the engine has been rebuilt and it has 5 miles on the odometer, so this WWII relic purrs like a kitten.</p>
<p>All three of these vintage Harley-Davidson motorcycles are highly original, so you’re not getting something which is missing most of the factory parts, making them excellent investment vehicles. Really, you couldn’t go wrong with any of them, but which would you pick?</p>
<p>Each motorcycle is available through <a href="https://www.bulletmotorsports.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Bullet Motorsports</a>.</p>
