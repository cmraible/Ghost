<p>Clearly, there's a whole bunch of stuff I missed during my enforced hiatus from this blog, but this story about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/medium-s-ev-williams-is-said-to-discuss-buying-new-york-magazine">Ev Williams and Medium</a> stuck in my mind:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Medium</a>, the publishing website run by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TWTR:US" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter Inc.</a> co-founder Ev Williams, expressed interest in buying New York Magazine and other media properties, according to people familiar with the situation.</blockquote>
<p>Uh…why?</p>
<blockquote>“We are going to significantly increase our investment in original editorial in the next year,” Williams, 46, said in a statement.</blockquote>
<p>This is just bizarre. In an attempt to <em>finally</em> sort out a viable business model, Medium has pretty much ended up where it started. Remember back in 2013 when <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/long-form-science-journalism-site-matter-acquired-by-medium/s2/a552702/">Medium acquired <em>Matter</em></a>, a long-form science journalism start-up that launched on Kickstarter?</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/2017/02/medium-kills-matter/">It didn't end well</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are again, with Williams hunting around, looking for content businesses to acquire. Yes, perhaps adding a pool of high-profile writers would actually make Medium's subscriptions more attractive. Right now, there's an awful lot of poor fluff on there; terrible "lifestyle coaching" posts, some relentless marketing — and a few posts of value. </p>

<p>Medium has developed a "voice" — it's fluffy, shiny, high-concept, but low depth. It's become the collective blog of the worst aspects of the Silicon Valley carpet-baggers, and that's not what Williams was hoping for. They've been steadily buying their way into higher quality by hiring some well-respected journalists. <a href="https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887">Jessica Valenti</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@rushkoff">Douglas Rushkoff</a> are <a href="https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887">exclusive Medium columnists</a><a>.</a></p>
<p>Acquiring a publication would suggest that the approach is working, and might be what they need. However, if they do this - what have they become? A content business with a pool of freebie content created by amateurs around it. They're the Huffington Post of 2008 with a paywall. And that's an awful long way from the original vision.</p>
<p>Added to that, the Medium editor, once the platform's crown jewel, has now been matched and — arguably — surpassed by <a href="https://ma.tt/2018/11/a-gutenberg-faq/">WordPress's Gutenberg</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2018/08/one-man-his-blog-is-now-running-on-ghost-2-0/">Ghost's Koenig</a> editors. What was once cutting edge is now looking stale. </p>
<p>And it's still worrisome that after half a decade Medium is till shifting around, looking for a business model that works, and looking to spend big money while struggling to build significant revenue. </p>
