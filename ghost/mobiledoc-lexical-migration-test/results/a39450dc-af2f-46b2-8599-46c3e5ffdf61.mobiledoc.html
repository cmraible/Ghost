<h2 id="going-solo-as-a-journalist">Going solo as a journalist</h2>
<p>An interesting piece on the Ghost blog by Rob Andrews, once of <em>Paid Content</em> fame, many, many moons ago. He looks at writers who have created their own micropubs successfully, including friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://theaircurrent.com">Jon Ostrower</a>. </p>
<p>Rob actually contacted me about the piece, and my first response was “You should speak to Jon…”. </p>

<h2 id="journalism-via-whatsapp">Journalism via WhatsApp</h2>
<p>This is going into the reading list for one of my lectures to the <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/interactive-journalism">Interhacktives</a> this year. It's a great example of both engaged journalism and using WhatsApp as a research tool. For those who have encountered my “digital inverted pyramid” model of journalistic social media use, this is squarely at the intersection of story finding and networking. </p>

<p>“Adam," I hear you say, “why have you included a nature podcast in today's round-up?”</p>
<p>Well, says I, it's because there's some interesting stuff in there both about stock photography as a profession — and what sorts of cameras are being used for professional stock. One name I didn't expect: GoPro.</p>
