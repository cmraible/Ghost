Thanks to social media, the trend has spread to other areas, concerning police and other municipal leaders as residents are terrorized."

We don‚Äôt want to get into detail about how they do it, although we did run across some step-by-step guides, but we will say it involves removing the steering column cover. That‚Äôs similar to the rash of thefts for 90s Hondas where criminals employed a somewhat similar technique back in the day, only this time around USB charging cables are the tool of choice. Only this time social media seems to be making the problem bigger as it spreads from Milwaukee to Chicago, Michigan, and beyond."

          "Tommy G lives in Milwaukee, which is where he did all the interviews. He states at the beginning of the documentary that he believes everyone has a heart and he wants to prove that by talking to the Kia Boyz. But many of the regular Milwaukee residents didn‚Äôt feel so kind towards the car thieves. Multiple said they should do hard time for their misdeeds. One had her car stolen by them and said it created plenty of financial hardship for her. On camera, the Kia Boyz seem pretty jovial about the chaos they spread, behaving like they‚Äôre local celebrities instead of hooligans. One would think they don‚Äôt care at all the pain they have cause for so many of their neighbors. In fact, they at one point say if someone is killed by them while they‚Äôre driving recklessly, it‚Äôs the victim‚Äôs fault since they should‚Äôve gotten out of the way."

What‚Äôs left out of the conversation is what the parents of the Kia Boyz are doing about their children‚Äôs activity. Tommy G asked a couple of them if their mom knows what they‚Äôre doing, and they simply replied that she ‚Äúknows I got a case for that s***.‚Äù Some adult men in the area said these kids are just doing what they want, which was what they did when they were the same age, blowing it off as just some youthful phase and nothing more."
