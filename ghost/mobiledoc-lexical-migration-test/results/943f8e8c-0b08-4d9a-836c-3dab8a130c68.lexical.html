<p>As chaos engulfs Twitter (Musk is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/musk-fires-twitter-engineers-after-critical-posts-on-twitter-and-slack.html">firing people on Twitter</a> now), and Meta slashes staff, there's a whiff of decay around the long-established social media giants. Is their era finally over? </p>
<p>Things are certainly changing. Euan Semple, author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3g9aka8"><em>Organisations Don't Tweet, People Do</em></a>, is <a href="https://euansemple.blog/2022/11/15/deleting-my-social-media-accounts/">deleting his social media accounts</a>, bar Mastodon. (It's entertaining that his blog will both pre-date and outlast his social media accounts‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>However, the best summary of the mood is probably <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/?utm_source=pocket_saves">Ian Bogost's piece in <em>The Atlantic</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>It‚Äôs over. Facebook is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/facebook-scrambles-to-escape-death-spiral-as-users-flee-sales-drop.html">in decline</a>, Twitter <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/elon-musk-twitter-nightmare-scenarios/671906/">in chaos</a>. Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs empire has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-stock-down-earnings-700-billion-in-lost-value/">lost</a> hundreds of billions of dollars in value and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-to-cut-11-000-jobs-11667992427">laid off</a> 11,000 people, with its ad business in peril and its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/">metaverse fantasy</a> in irons. Elon Musk‚Äôs takeover of Twitter has caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/technology/twitter-advertisers.html">advertisers</a> to pull spending and power users to shun the platform (or at least to tweet a lot about doing so). It‚Äôs never felt more plausible that the age of social media might end‚Äîand soon.</blockquote>
<p>The core of his argument was that this is a <em>good </em>thing, that humans are just not meant to communicate this much, with such frequency:</p>
<blockquote>It was never a <em>terrible </em>idea, at least, to use computers to connect to one another on occasion, for justified reasons, and in moderation (although the risk of instrumentalizing one another was present from the outset). The problem came from doing so all the time, as a lifestyle, an aspiration, an obsession.</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that this isn't really an argument for the death of social media, just for the subset of platforms that have dominated it since the mid-2000s. The decade and a half defined by Facebook and Twitter are coming to their end, but ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù as an idea will outlive those services. </p>
<p>For a start, some services are still growing well. While Bogost mentions TikTok, his argument ignores the ongoing rise of the platform - which continues to expand globally at a fair old clip:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1327116/number-of-global-tiktok-users/" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/1327116/number-of-global-tiktok-users.jpg" alt="Statistic: Number of TikTok users worldwide from 2020 to 2025 (in millions) | Statista" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:1000px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" /></a><br /><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>In Bogost's terms, it's social media, without really being a social network. It does very little in the way of creating a social graph between users. But then TikTok is often under-estimated by largely words-centric journalists. This should be exactly what we're weaning ourselves off ‚Äî but we're not. </p>
<p>What should scare those of us in the words business is that it's text-centric social media that's in decline. Nobody's worrying about the future of TikTok ‚Äî or YouTube. </p>
<h2 id="social-media-is-born-of-social-creatures-not-technology">Social media is born of social creatures, not technology</h2>
<p>But more to the point, I see very little indication that people will suddenly give up creating content online and sharing it with others. It's so deeply ingrained into human nature that we've been doing it since the internet began. From e-mail discussion lists to newsgroups to forums to blogs to social media, the one constant of internet culture is people creating things and trying to share their works with others. </p>
<p>But <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> we do it is likely to change. and here, Bogost is spot-on:</p>
<blockquote>To speak less, to fewer people and less often‚Äîand for them to do the same to you, and everyone else as well.</blockquote>
<p>What he's described is something we've already seen happening: people are shifting to chat apps, hiding away in smaller discussions between more limited groups of like-minded people. Mastodon has small, local servers, as well as the ability to follow people globally. Slack and Discord have both been great successes. </p>
<p>Social Media in the 2010s sense is in decline. There's very little doubt about that. But new things will emerge, new communities will form, and new ways of sharing our thoughts and creativity will follow. </p>
<p>We are, fundamentally, social creatures, and we will use any connective technology to communicate. Human nature doesn't change much, we just express it in different ways as technology evolves. </p>

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/11/aggregators.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Birds and news aggregating together" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1339" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/aggregators.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/aggregators.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/aggregators.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/11/aggregators.jpg 2021w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>I was aware that news aggregators were becoming a bigger slice of publisher traffic than many people realise, but I wasn't conscious of the fact that <a href="https://digiday.com/media/news-aggregators-arent-growing-like-they-used-to-but-publishers-still-see-their-value/?utm_campaign=UA-39227834-1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">they'd become this big</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Traffic driven by news aggregators ‚Äî as a percent of total traffic referred by social, search and links ‚Äî has gone down from from 18-20% in 2020 to about 14% in 2022, according to Chartbeat data, which analyzed aggregators including Apple News, Google News, SmartNews, Yahoo News, News360, Newsbreak, Flipboard, Upday, MSN, Feedly, NewsNow, Newzit, Drudge Report, Press Explorer, Inoreader, Ground News and Pocket.</blockquote>
<p>The small decline is a relative one: it's the result by the growth of search as a referrer. Looks like I need to do more aggregator content in the Audience Strategy module at City‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>This is an intriguing quote, and a good place to start our thinking:</p>
<blockquote>Nicholson from Chartbeat agreed: ‚ÄúOne of the things these aggregators actually do for some sites is awareness. You don‚Äôt need Apple News to tell you what The New York Times is, but usually I am seeing smaller metro newspapers surfacing on these aggregators too ‚Ä¶ it might be a good way to start me on my loyalty journey,‚Äù she said.</blockquote>
