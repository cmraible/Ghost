Automakers like Lamborghini have been conducting business as usual while mainstream brands like Dodge, Chevrolet, Toyota, etc. have had to cut back production, causing prices to increase sharply as supply dwindles."

We always share our five-year production plan with our main and key suppliers, and that allows our suppliers to size themselves to properly supply Lamborghini.”"
