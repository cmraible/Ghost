While it’s great Lexus is trying to find ways to spice up EVs and make them feel more analog, we’re skeptical about just how fun something like this is to drive. Maybe it’s a blast, but since we haven’t been able to take it for a spin we’re reserving judgment."

However, we hate how in some newer cars engine noises are ported in the cabin through the speakers. We also aren’t fans of EVs making outright fake V8 noises, which absolutely don’t sound like the real thing. It’s like eating a tofu burger or some other plant-based meat. Again, we appreciate the thought, but perhaps the best thing to do is keep offering some V8 performance rides with a manual transmission, you know, for old time’s sake and to keep us from falling asleep behind the wheel."
