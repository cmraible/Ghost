We can argue all day long about what that means, but that’s their preference and since the Raptor is wider than a regular F-150, it might seem like a little too much truck. In that vein, the Raptor isn’t so great for more technical trails. We’re not sure if this build is, either, but it will fit in narrower passes and should have a better breakover angle."
