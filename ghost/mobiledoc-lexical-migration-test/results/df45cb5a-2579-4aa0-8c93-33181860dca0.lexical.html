<hr>
<p>Joe Rogan is best known as a comedian and UFC commentator with a distinct voice that is instantly recognizable. A passionate car enthusiast with a net worth estimated at $100.4 million (£80million), the 52-year-old New Jersey native has one of the most amazing and enviable collections around. With mostly classic car-dominated, Rogan's most recent purchase is a modern Tesla Model S worth about $100,000 (£80,000). </p>
<p>Here is a list of Rogan's insane car collection.</p>
<h3 id="porsche-911-gt3-rs">Porsche 911 GT3 RS</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-porsche.png" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" joe-porsche.png" alt="Porsche 911 GT3 RS">" loading="lazy" width="1192" height="714" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/joe-porsche.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/joe-porsche.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-porsche.png 1192w"></figure>
<p>A huge Porsche fan, Rogan has owned a 911 996 Turbo and a Porsche 997 GT3 in the past. In his collection now sits this Porsche 911 GT3 RS worth over $300,000. From the factory, this fine German car tops out at 193 miles per hour, but Rogan took the car tuned by Sharkwerks for even more power and performance.</p>
<h3 id="1965-corvette-stingray">1965 Corvette Stingray</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-corvette.png" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" joe-corvette.png" alt="Joe Rogan's 1965 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray">" loading="lazy" width="1274" height="774" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/joe-corvette.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/joe-corvette.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-corvette.png 1274w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure>
<p>Also sitting inside Rogan's collection is this silver 1965 Corvette Stingray. His pride and joy, he even showed off this pristine muscle car on an episode of <em>Jay Leno's Garage</em>. This Corvette falls into the restomod category since it is far from its factory beginnings. Now powered by a modern LS1 V8 engine topped with a Magnusson supercharger, this Vette has been modernized inside and out. This car is worth about $125,500.</p>
<h3 id="tesla-model-s">Tesla Model S</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-tesla.png" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" joe-tesla.png" alt="A Tesla Model S">" loading="lazy" width="1272" height="960" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/joe-tesla.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/joe-tesla.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-tesla.png 1272w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure>
<p>Another vehicle owned by Rogan is one of a different kind - an electric Tesla Model S worth about $100,000 (£80,000). After Rogan drove the car he described it as "one of the strangest experiences I've ever had behind the wheel of a car." Admitting that the car was a fun car to drive, he also said it "the most preposterously quick vehicle" he has ever driven.</p>
<h3 id="ford-mustang">Ford Mustang</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-mustang.png" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" joe-mustang.png" alt="Ford Mustang">" loading="lazy" width="1910" height="1210" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/joe-mustang.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/joe-mustang.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/joe-mustang.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-mustang.png 1910w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure>
<p>Joe also owns a 2014 Ford Mustang powered by the 5.0-liter Coyote V8 engine. From the factory, these cars generate 420-horsepower and plenty of torque. (Pictured here is a 2015-2017 Ford Mustang)</p>
<h3 id="bmw-m3">BMW M3</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-bmw.png" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" joe-bmw.png" alt="Joe Rogan's BMW M3">" loading="lazy" width="1274" height="964" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/joe-bmw.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/joe-bmw.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-bmw.png 1274w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure>
<p>The BMW M3 is a car that has been discussed on his podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience where he describes it a the "perfect balanced car". With sparkly aftermarket Avante Garde wheels, Joe loves his M3.</p>
<h3 id="ford-bronco">Ford Bronco</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhGbGYji8ew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p>A Ford Bronco from the 1960s is also a part of Rogan's extensive collection, and according to The Sun it is also a must-have. In a 2019 YouTube video, Joe showed off his modified Bronco that is outfitted with custom wheels, large tires, big brakes, and shock absorbers.</p>
<h3 id="mk-iv-toyota-supra">MK IV Toyota Supra</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-supra.png" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" joe-supra.png" alt="Toyota Supra MK IV">" loading="lazy" width="1274" height="1194" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/joe-supra.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/joe-supra.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/07/joe-supra.png 1274w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure>
<p>Joe's very first car was a Toyota Supra MK IV, a car produced from 1993 to 1998. He drove the sports car around New Jersey when he was rising comic. Today, the Supra is a highly desired JDM vehicle with its curvaceous body, big rear wing, and the twin-turbo 2JZ-GTE inline-six engine that generated a factory 320-horsepower.</p>
<p>That concludes Joe Rogan's epic and enviable car collection. We wouldn't mind just picking one of these cars to stash in our garages to ogle at everyday. </p>
