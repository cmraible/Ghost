That’s what makes this rendering by Instagram account wb.artist20so interesting. He erases the rear doors on the Charger and adds some more retro styling cues for a different look."

It’s blockier with rectangular headlights and probably poorer aerodynamics, but is that really important to everyone? You get to be the judge on that."

Less obvious but still plain to see is the more aggressive diffuser. It looks like the big change is the addition of five rather large canards. We’re unclear how that’s a tribute to the 60s Chargers, but it does look more track-ready we suppose. A 3-foot-tall rear wing would’ve really made this rendering interesting, but maybe that’s coming next."
