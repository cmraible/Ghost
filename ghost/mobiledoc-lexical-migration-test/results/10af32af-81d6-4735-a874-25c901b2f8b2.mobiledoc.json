This head unit is able to receive digital radio stations through DAB+, and it is compatible with iPhone 5 and newer while offering media playback through a variety of sources including Apple CarPlay, SD card, USB port and Bluetooth. Best of all, despite its 3.5-inch touch-screen display, this single-DIN design retains a retro styling with a pair of rotary dials and six buttons."

          "As far as pricing goes, Porsche has not yet announced how much these units will cost for U.S. buyers, but the press release indicates the PCCM will be sold for 1,439.89 euros ($1,556 USD) while the PCCM Plus will sell for $1,606.51 ($1,736 USD). That's a bit higher than your standard aftermarket head unit, but these factory-made units not only have a retro look, they also have the ever-important \"Porsche\" branding right on the front."
