The sponsorship program was founded by Count Metello Rossi di Montelera of Martini & Rossi, and dates back to 1958 as Martini International Club. The race cars are adorned with dark blue, light blue and red stripes on white, red or silver body cars. Martini Racing’s livery is one of the most well-known liveries in the world and easily recognizable – even if you’re not huge into motorsports."
