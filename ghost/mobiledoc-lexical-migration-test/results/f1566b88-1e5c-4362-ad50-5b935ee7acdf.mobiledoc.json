At the time American was on the up and up having saved the world. With the economy booming and optimism everywhere, it seemed like nothing was impossible. The strong, optimistic worth ethic of the country is embodied in this classic workhorse, which is currently for sale through "

Thanks to an expert frame-off restoration, all details on this pickup look absolutely amazing. You’ll even find rich oak boards in the bed with a polyurethane stain that lets the grain show through, plus stainless steel trim. This is the kind of vehicle you can take places and cause a real stir as people reminisce or are astounded at its beautiful design."

In the cab, the two-tone red and white upholstery is free of damage and blemishes. Switchgear, steering wheel, and gauges all have a factory appearance, but there’s an electronic gauge cluster designed to fit just like the original."
