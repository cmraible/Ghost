<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-1948-cadillac-madam-v/">The Ringbrothers</a> car modification company is a name that has become synonymous with high horsepower customs and sleek SEMA show builds within the car culture. Some of their most well-known super sleepers consist of the basic formula, More power + classic muscle = instant hit. However with some of their builds, such as their most recent endeavor, come from a place of love for reasonable horsepower, drivable, restomods. </p>
<blockquote><em>See what the Ringbrothers did to a Ford F100 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/restomod-1956-ford-f100/"><em>here.</em></a></em></blockquote>
<p>With the unfortunate cancellation of the 2020 SEMA show, many automotive modification connoisseurs decided to throw in their hats and focus on other builds rather than an expensive show car that wouldn't even help to flow business their way. This wasn't the case for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-k5-blazer-future/">the Ringbrothers</a> however because the boys just put out another one of their beautiful restomods and it is stunning.</p>

<p>This is a Mercury Cougar, but don't let looks fool you because this is not what you would expect from a car that is almost 53 years old now. The cougar was built upon the same platform as the Mustang at the time and was made to be Mercury’s luxury performance model. To keep with the original idea, the Ringbrothers decided to slap a 5.0L Coyote V8 which transfers a tame but powerful 450 horsepower through a 10-speed automatic transmission which was pulled out of a Ford F-150 Raptor. Handling is made possible by the DSE suspension, HRE wheels, and upgraded brakes that help the car stop on a dime.</p>

<p>Ringbrothers has stated that they “Pour their heart into every car that we make and this was no exception.” The goal here was to create a car that was quote “mild and classy…” and it is clear that this goal has been accomplished by combining classic styling with the perfect amount of horsepower for this antique ride. When others heard hard times were on the way they ran and hid, however, the Ringbrothers stayed and fought. What came out of it was an incredibly cool and elegant car fit for any car show.</p>
