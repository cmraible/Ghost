<p>Each week, we partner with <em>Breaking Points</em> to review some of <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s most impactful reporting in a video discussion with Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.</p>
<p>In this week’s discussion, David Sirota reviewed <a href="__GHOST_URL__/worker-protection-bill-blocked-before-tornado-disaster/"><em>The Daily Poster’s</em> huge scoop</a> on how Amazon-linked lobbying groups were fighting legislation designed to prohibit retribution against employees who seek to leave work out of fear for their safety. The lobbying happened in the months before deadly tornadoes wreaked havoc across several states last weekend — including at an Amazon warehouse, where workers were killed. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/larry-virden-tornado-victim-who-died-in-amazon-warehouse-wasnt-allowed-to-leave-girlfriend-says">Text messages</a> reportedly show workers saying they weren’t allowed to leave and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-17/amazon-tornado-aftermath-workers-say-they-lacked-emergency-training">feared</a> losing their jobs. </p>
