          "One of the Corvette's biggest enthusiasts was Chip Miller, who owned about 80 of them over his lifetime. He was also the founder of Carlisle events with his business partner Bill Miller (no relation). Sadly, Chip Miller passed away in 2004 of amyloidosis, and that's when his wife Judy and partner Bill started the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation in his honor. Many know Carlisle as the place to be for collector and classic cars as it is one of the biggest events in the country, and the Spring Carlisle show is a must on every enthusiast's calendar. Corvettes of Carlisle is the largest gathering of 'Vettes in the world, bringing in about 5,000 each time."

Sitting on an aluminum-structured frame, the Z51 package includes a performance rear axle ratio and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Stopping power is provided by anti-lock and disc brakes on all four corners with black-painted brake calipers. Keeping the Corvette in line and planted to the ground is the FE1 Corvette suspension, all-speed traction control, and active handling stability control. Additional performance and adding to the V8's soundtrack is the aluminized stainless steel exhaust with stainless tips. The oil life monitoring system keeps vital signs in check. "
