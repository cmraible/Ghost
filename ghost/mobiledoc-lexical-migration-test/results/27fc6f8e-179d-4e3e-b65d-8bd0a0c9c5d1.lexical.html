<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Vintage+Cruisers">Vintage Cruisers</a> of Flagstaff, Arizona is pleased to announce this <a href="https://www.vintagecruisers.com/vehicles/939/1974-oldsmobile-442">1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass 442</a> W-30 455 big-block coupe up for sale. It may sound like a mouthful, but that’s because this is no ordinary 4-4-2. This W-30 455 example is mostly original but includes some added goodies.</p>
<p>For starters, it’s equipped with the Hurst/Olds appearance package embossed with special paint schemes and sleek pin striping. The car is dressed in its original paint with special H/O insignia on either side. The interior features the optional swiveling black vinyl bucket seats. A special vinyl top further designates the special nature of this model and gives it a T-top appearance.</p>

<p>The easiest and quickest way to tell the difference between a 350 V8 and a 455 V8 version is by looking at the front fenders of the 1974 model. If it’s powered by the 350, it has the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=cutlass">Cutlass</a> script emblem, while the 455 includes “W-30” decals in place of the written word.</p>
<p>The heart and soul of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=1974+oldsmobile+442">1974 Oldsmobile 442</a> is the powerful asphalt-ripping, high-performance 455 cubic-inch “Rocket” engine, which pushes out a potent 230 horsepower when mated to the 400 Hydramatic transmission with the Hurst dual-gate shifter. It’s equipped with power front disc brakes behind Drag Weld alloy wheels. With the turn of the key, this W-30 fires right up, sounds amazing, and runs great.</p>

<p>The car has recently been serviced and is among the last of the big-block muscle machines. What’s more, we all know that these types of vehicles are “only original once” and they don’t make ‘em like these anymore. This unrestored W-30 455 has just 13,488 miles on it with a mostly rust-free body and chassis. The sale of this Olds includes the factory paperwork, all manuals, original spare cover, and jack.
