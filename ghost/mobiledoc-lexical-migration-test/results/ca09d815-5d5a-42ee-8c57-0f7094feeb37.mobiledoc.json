While burnouts are inherently easy to do (on a track, with permission), this driver was not familiar with the process of stopping, apparently. Thankfully, the only thing hurt is a few stationary objects and not someone’s kids."

The second clue is that the Monte Carlo goes flying almost as soon as the smoke starts, maybe he got spooked? Maybe he was trying (poorly) to do a rolling burnout? Either way, he totally loses control of the car and smacks into some trash cans and two parked cars."
