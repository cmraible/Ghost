[Yesterdayâ€™s post](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/10/the_skill_of_short_sharp_blogging.html), which mentioned not keeping drafts in your blog platform? Iâ€™m guilty. Below is the second oldest draft I have (of eleven in total), in the exact form it was left on the 28th of April 2008 (catch you below for some commentary):\n\n- - - - - -\n\n<span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\">[  \n![French Lunch](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/pics/2008/French Lunch-thumb-500x376.jpg)](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/pics/2008/French%20Lunch.html)</span>\n\n<div>[Graham](http://www.noodlepie.com)â€˜s recent post on the Word of Mouth blog bemoaning the [rise of lunch <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">al desko</span>](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/food/2008/04/the_lost_art_of_lunch.html) reminds meÂ </div><div></div><div>Grahamâ€™s thesis is that the desk lunch is a result of a too-distant relationship with our food. Iâ€™d suggest that it also suggest that weâ€™re far too attached to our desks in an era when technology is liberating us from it.Â </div><div>- - - - - -\n\nThe irony of this one is that this is a subject I believe in *passionately*: journalists are too wedded to their desks, and not out and about in the communities they report for and on enough. Yet, Iâ€™ve left that post unwritten for *four years*.Â </div><div></div><div>Shameful. Iâ€™ll get to it. Itâ€™s on my to-do list. But right now, Iâ€™m far too exhausted after a long day running a content strategy workshop for a client, and this post is basically a lazy way of fulfilling my commitment to the #back2blog challenge. ðŸ˜‰</div>\n"
