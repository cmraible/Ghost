<hr>
<p>Back when the new crossover given the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-k5-blazer-future/">Chevy Blazer</a> name debuted, many a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mommy-mobile/">wine mom</a> cheered, then ran to the dealership to spend her husband’s money on one. Sadly, a few alleged gearheads also thought the “sports car” grocery getter was cool, but now it seems the novelty of the thing has worn off. Now, GM is offering discounts on 2022 and 2023 models, according to GM Authority. How embarrassing.</p>

<p>From the get-go, we thought the only way GM should bring back the Blazer name was if it were on a Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco competitor. But we also know automotive executives and their marketing hired guns don’t give a damn about legacy or enthusiasts at the end of the day. After all, wine moms’ husbands work two jobs to attend to their woman’s every whim.</p>
<p>So GM sold its birthright for a pot of porridge, or in this case a quick influx of cash for a flash-in-the-pan crossover. Unsurprisingly, the trend chasers who jumped on the bandwagon have moved on, meaning GM is left offering cash incentives to move 2022 and 2023 Chevy Blazers. We’ll call this justice and a big fat “we told you so.”</p>
<p>One only has to look at the sale success of the Ford Bronco to see what GM could’ve done had it gone that route. Sure, designing a real off-road rig is harder than slapping together something like this alleged Blazer, but real enthusiasts and of course the poser hangers-on would’ve rewarded GM for the effort for years to come. Instead, the automaker went for instant gratification, got it, and now is left with shame and regret. But modern GM has done this before and it will do it again.</p>
