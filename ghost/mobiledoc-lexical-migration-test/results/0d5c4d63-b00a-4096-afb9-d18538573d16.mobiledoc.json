That’s what we got when Joe Rogan invited Dale Earnhardt Jr. for a talk, which was an interesting episode. Since it happened about 4 years ago, you may or may not remember this, or maybe you missed it entirely. Anyway, we thought this particular clip of the show was interesting enough to share and reminisce over."

For someone who doesn’t know much about all the safety equipment and measures taken for professional races, that’s probably a mind-blowing revelation. In regular cars you have a shoulder belt and some exploding airbags to keep you safe from people who are doing anything but driving while behind the wheel, which is indeed scary."
