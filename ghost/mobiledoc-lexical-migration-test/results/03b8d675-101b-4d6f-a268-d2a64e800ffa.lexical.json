The man fully restored this creation which will wow most people, demonstrating that motorcycles can absolutely be used as beasts of burden. There’s a cab built around the motorcycle, and the driver (or rider) steers using the handlebars, just like they would with any other bike. A gear shifter is next to the bike, as if you’re driving a regular truck. The front wheel sticks out through a slot in the cab and there’s an electric starter, or you can choose to kick start the engine. It really is an interesting innovation to check out in person.",
