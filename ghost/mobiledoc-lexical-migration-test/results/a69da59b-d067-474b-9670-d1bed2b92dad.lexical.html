Approved by one of the best, this car was autographed by the king of drag racing - Don "Big Daddy" Garlits. <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/hellcat?promo=MOTORIOUS9">Dream Giveaway</a> teamed up with "Big Daddy" to offer this one-of-a-kind Hellcat Charger, and it can be yours.

<p>Not available at any Dodge dealer, this custom Pitch Black-painted Charger widebody is adorned with a special custom graphics package by Dream Giveaway that includes aggressive Hellcat graphics, matte black stripes with contrasting orange trim striping, a painted antenna, and custom-painted center caps on the wheels. More exterior highlights include an engine light and appearance kit from American Car Craft, an underbody light kit, a headlight and halo kit, Hellcat puddle lamps, and custom lighting inside the hood vents. The car also comes equipped with a carbon fiber front splitter, rear spoiler, and rear diffuser provided by APR Performance. Custom badging can be found on the front, rear and side. Orange brake calipers add the perfect touch of contrast to its stealthy exterior and peek out behind Warp Speed granite wheels wrapped with three-season performance tires (305/35ZR20)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this specially-ordered Hellcat was autographed by the iconic drag racer of 60 years Don "Big Daddy" Garlits that includes his legendary saying from the '60s scribed on the dash. "Sit down. Buckle up. Shut up." - 'Big Daddy' Don Garlits.</p>
<p>Under the hood of this <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/hellcat?promo=MOTORIOUS9">2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat Widebody</a> is a 6.2-liter V8 engine, but this one has been bumped to a pavement-pounding 1,000-horsepower thanks to the Stage 4R performance upgrade from Forza Tuning. A ported and polished blower sits atop the mill with a Forza supercharger hub assembly and custom upper pulley. Other mechanical modifications include the 10 percent overdrive crank damper, PCM modification, 160-degree thermostat, Brisk Racing spark plugs, a Forza custom fuel system upgrade, Forza engine management calibration, and all of the proper bushings, belts, gaskets and seals. </p>
<p>Kooks stainless long-tube headers send spent gases that exit out the exhaust, and a DSS aluminum 4-inch one-piece driveshaft has been rated at 1,000-hp. Other goodies include chromoly rear track bars, chrome upper lateral control arms, and Spohn tubular rear sway bar links. Everything on the car was professionally installed. This car can dominate the quarter-mile in the 10-second range and is capable of a top speed over 200 miles per hour. The performance package installed on this mean machine is valued at over $16,000.</p>
<p>Inside the car has even more incredible features such as black Alcantara Laguna seats complete with embossed Hellcat logos. More amazing features include a power sunroof, 200-mph speedometer, custom interior color accents, navigation and travel group, carbon fiber and suede interior package, and a Mr. Norm's pistol-grip shifter. A Harman Kardon Audio Group system with 19 speakers keeps your favorite tunes bumping. </p>
