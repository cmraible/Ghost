<h3 id="this-1968-chevrolet-is-insured-for-150000-and-sports-an-ls3-v8-along-with-a-whole-host-of-upgrades">This 1968 Chevrolet is insured for $150,000 and sports an LS3 V8 along with a whole host of upgrades.</h3>
<p>We simply love Camaro’s at Motorious, especially when they look like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/110945/1968-chevrolet-camaro">this</a> one offered by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Canyon+State+Classics">Canyon State Classics</a>. In 2019 you can find one in any state or specification. Whether it’s factory original, a barn find, or something more unique perhaps; like this 1968 LS3 swapped beast.</p>
<p>Finished in white with gorgeous US Mags wheels that reveal some hefty Wilwood brakes underneath, this car has had some serious cash thrown at it, and it shows. With some $100,000 being spent on parts alone, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Camaro">Camaro</a> is valued at $150,000 for an insurance replacement.</p>

<p>Built cars represent rather insane value for money, given this one could be in your garage for just $74,900. Looking into the details of the car definitely makes us want to ring the bank.</p>
<p>The LS3 V8 has LS7 aluminium heads fitted with a Performance Roller Rocker setup. Holley ignition takes care of the electronic fuel injection, with an upgraded cam and intake manifold. Although there’s no word on power, with 426 horsepower in standard form, we would assume it’s pushing even more with the aforementioned upgrades.</p>

<p>Look around the rest of the car and clearly the builder had some serious taste. Clean lines with chrome trim refinished in black contrasts with the rest of the car beautifully, not to mention the black leather interior that is as new.</p>
<p>For more restomod goodness there’s a state of the art Kicker sound system installed, along with a nifty touchscreen to make music selection a doddle. That said, we’re sure you’re unlikely to make use of it given that whacking great 6.2 liter under the hood.</p>
<p>Naturally given its full rotisserie restoration, all possible hardware has been refurbished or replaced, such as the rubbers which can sometimes be avoided in these builds.</p>
