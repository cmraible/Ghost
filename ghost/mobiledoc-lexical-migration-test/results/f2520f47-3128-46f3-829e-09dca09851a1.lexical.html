<p>Another <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-dodge-challenger-pushed/">Dodge Challenger</a> has been stolen in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/detroit-woman-drags-thief/">Detroit</a>, only this time the muscle car was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-fatal-wreck/">crashed</a> while kids were in the backseat. You might be wondering what happens to these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-muscle-catnip-to-criminals/">Mopars</a> after they’re swiped. In at least this case it sounds like someone turned the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-render-eyes/">2018 Dodge Challenger Scat Pack</a> over to a parent to transport their kids around, which is unbelievable reckless.</p>
<blockquote><em>Dodge has announced its overdue security update, but the details of the rollout are pretty confusing. We untangle everything for you <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-security-update-rollout/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to a local report, the Challenger was stolen from an apartment building in Farmington Hills about a month before the crash. Bhargava Mangu, the owner of the Mopar muscle car, reported it stolen to police. He probably wondered if he’d ever see the vehicle again.</p>
<p>On August 27 at about 1:30 pm police in Detroit spotted the Dodge Challenger at a gas station, noting it was stolen. That’s when they tried pulling it over, but the unidentified 20-year-old man driving it refused and instead tried to get away.</p>

<p>As happens all too often, the driver’s capabilities were outstripped by the muscle car’s and he crashed. Unfortunately, he hit a Pontiac Montana minivan, smashing the passenger side of the Challenger and crumpling the front end of the Pontiac.</p>
<p>The driver of the Mopar was injured badly enough he was taken away on a stretcher, but he’s still in police custody. Thankfully, the two young children in the backseat of the muscle car weren’t hurt. As for the 69-year-old driver of the minivan, he reportedly was taken to the hospital but is expected to be fine.</p>
<p>Mangu was shocked to find out someone was driving around in his stolen car with kids in the back. However, it sounds like it being stolen wasn’t so much of a shock. The man told reporters his car had been swiped three times in the past year, highlighting how frequently the high-powered Mopar muscle cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-hellcats-hot-thieves/">are taken by thieves</a>.</p>
<p>These sports cars man they do not have more security in them for theft," Mangu said. "Like I said, it was stolen three times in one year. I think that says how bad the theft security is."</p>
