<p>Friends,</p>
<p>At first glance, it might have seemed like a low-stakes news story: Taylor Swift fans crying foul after they couldn‚Äôt buy tickets to their favorite pop star‚Äôs concerts. But the brouhaha last week struck to the heart of a deeply troubling matter: TicketMaster‚Äôs domination over the live music and event industry, to the detriment of consumers, independent venues, and performing artists alike. In <strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/ticketmaster-faces-the-music/?utm_source=newsletter-email&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=newsletter-article">today‚Äôs featured story</a></strong>, Jordan Uhl digs into Ticketmaster‚Äôs monopoly power ‚Äî and explores why the ire of ‚ÄúSwifties‚Äù could be what finally takes it down.</p>
<p>Check out the full story below, then be on the lookout for tomorrow‚Äôs episode of our podcast <a href="https://the.levernews.com/podcasts/#lever-time"><em>Lever Time</em></a>, where I will be joined by Uhl and Max Collins, frontman of the rock band Eve 6, to discuss the rise and potential fall of Ticketmaster.</p>

<p>The online ticketing giant Ticketmaster has been using its monopoly power for years to abuse artists, fans, and venues alike ‚Äî but now, thanks to a perfect storm of political and cultural factors, not to mention an army of Taylor Swift fans, it could face a long-overdue government thumping now that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly conducting an antitrust investigation into the company.</p>
<p>Ticketmaster operates as a monopoly in the concerts and live events industry, controlling every stage of the business ‚Äî from ticket sales to event promotions to venue operations ‚Äî ever since its merger in 2010 with event promoter and venue operator Live Nation, which <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/01/doj-approves-modified-ticketmaster-live-nation-merger/">the DOJ approved</a>.</p>
<p>The new parent company became Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. One of the conditions in the DOJ‚Äôs consent decree for the newly-formed company was a prohibition on retaliating against venues for using other ticketing servicers. Despite this, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/live-nation-ticketmaster-class-action-1235070131/">venues have alleged</a> for years that‚Äôs exactly what Live Nation has done. Through this merger, as well as their aggressive tactics, Live Nation Entertainment now controls more than <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/live-nation-ticketmaster-class-action-1235070131/#:~:text=market%20share%20exceeding-,70%20percent,-of%20primary%20ticketing">70 percent</a> of the live event market.</p>
<p>Along with penalizing independent venues and frustrating music fans, Live Nation has also set its sights on the few remaining ways live musicians make money, including demanding cuts of merchandise sales, leaving artists with few options left.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>‚ÄúIn typical let-no-tragedy-go-to-waste fashion, Live Nation used the pandemic to scoop up even more clubs who couldn‚Äôt afford to keep the lights on,‚Äù Max Collins, frontman for rock band Eve 6, told <em>The Lever</em>. ‚ÄúThe artists touring the club circuit are lucky if they break even, and this monolithic corporation is putting its scaly claw in their pocket to grab for more. You have them demanding 20 cents or more of every dollar a band makes from selling their own T-shirts and hoodies. The degree to which this company scales artist and fan exploitation would be funny if it wasn‚Äôt so fucked up.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="from-ticketer-to-sprawling-industry-monopoly">From Ticketer To Sprawling Industry Monopoly</h3>
<p>Founded as a ticketing system computer company in 1976, Ticketmaster became the market leader in the ticket industry by buying up competitors like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/business/company-news-ticketmaster-deal-to-get-ticketron.html">Ticketron</a> and pushing for laws that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/09/11/6056146/ticketmaster-targets-secondary-market">restricted ticket resales</a> to authorized companies like itself.</p>
<p>As the company has become the dominant ticketing operation, concerns have grown over its monopolistic practices ‚Äî including how it treats consumers. Event-goers have criticized the ticket retailer for years, arguing the fees tacked onto sales were exorbitant and often disproportionate to the ticket‚Äôs face value. A class-action lawsuit, originally filed in 2003, taking aim at these excessive fees was eventually settled in 2014 for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/ticketmaster-agrees-400-million-settlement-709148/">$400 million</a>, without Ticketmaster or its parent company Live Nation admitting wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has continued what many believe to be the same predatory practices. Earlier this year, <em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em> reported it had found tickets for events on Ticketmaster with fees ranging around 70 percent of the ticket‚Äôs face value and one with fees totaling <a href="https://youtu.be/-_Y7uqqEFnY?t=214">more than the ticket itself</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Live Nation has spent more than <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2022&id=D000053134">$3 million</a> on federal lobbying, according to OpenSecrets, including on efforts to beat back attempts in Congress to better regulate event ticket markets. Forbes Tate Partners, one lobbying firm employed by Live Nation, has also <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-next-war-against-a-public-option/">led the health care industry‚Äôs campaign</a> to defeat reform proposals like Medicare for All and a public health insurance option, as well as efforts to lower the Medicare eligibility age. The firm‚Äôs work for Live Nation has included <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e9c11949-459e-46a6-83c8-794c37fe64b9/print/">lobbying</a> on ‚Äúissues related to transparency and accountability to ticket sales pricing‚Äù and ‚Äúissues related to antitrust enforcement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Live Nation‚Äôs leadership and investors have deep ties to the Republican establishment and the conservative billionaire class. Its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/taylor-swift-ticketmaster-fiasco-due-to-demand-bots-liberty-media-ceo-says.html">largest shareholder</a> is Liberty Media Corporation, which also controls a <a href="https://www.libertymedia.com/tracking-stocks/liberty-siriusxm-group">75 percent stake</a> in the satellite radio company Sirius XM.</p>
<p>At the helm of Liberty Media sits John Malone, a multi-billionaire media mogul, <a href="https://www.cato.org/about/leadership#:~:text=David%20H.%20Koch-,John%20C.%20Malone,-William%20A.%20Niskanen">director emeritus</a> and former board member of the right-wing think tank Cato Institute, and prominent donor to <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2017/04/19/john-malone-greg-maffeiliberty-media-among-big.html#:~:text=John%20Malone%20and%20his%20Liberty%20Media%20business%20empire%20were%20among%20the%20big%20contributors%20to%20President%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20inauguration%20festivities%2C%20donating%20a%20collective%20%241%20million.">Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential inauguration</a> as well as various other conservative politicians and causes.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as chairman of Liberty Media, Malone is a major shareholder and sits on the board of directors at <a href="https://wbd.com/leadership/dr-john-c-malone/">Warner Bros. Discovery</a>, now the parent company of CNN. Last year, Malone <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/11/18/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-liberty-media-chairman-john-malone.html">called for</a> CNN to model itself more like Fox News. In its reporting on Live Nation and Ticketmaster last week, CNN did not disclose this relationship.</p>
<p>As Live Nation has become a major venue operator, it has also worked to rig the venue industry in its favor. Live Nation now owns, operates, or leases at least 165 venues in North America, according to <a href="https://investors.livenationentertainment.com/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0001335258-22-000019/lyv-20211231.htm?TB_iframe=true&height=auto&width=auto&preload=false">an annual financial report</a> the company filed earlier this year.</p>
<p>As live events were ground to a halt at the onset of the pandemic, independent music venues sought assistance from the government to remain in operation. Congress set aside $15 billion in aid meant for smaller venues, but Live Nation spent lobbied aggressively in order to ¬† gain access to those funds, despite being on a much more solid financial footing than small, independent venues.</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/22/live-nation-pandemic-aid/">$19 million</a> ended up being allocated to Live Nation subsidiaries as a result of the lobbying effort, according to reporting by <em>The Washington Post</em>. Around the same time, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinkelley/2020/04/29/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-buys-500-million-stake-in-live-nation/?sh=679ac60d1daf">funneled around $500 million</a> into Live Nation in exchange for a 5.7 percent stake in the company, making it the company‚Äôs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-takes-500-million-stake-in-live-nation-11588012121">third-largest</a> shareholder.</p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Chow-is-this-not-extortion%E2%80%9D">‚ÄúHow Is This Not Extortion?‚Äù</h3>
<p>Caught in all of this consolidation are smaller artists who already struggle to make a living wage, due to the decline in record sales as fans opt for streaming services. Spotify, the largest music streaming platform owning more than a third of the market, only pays artists <a href="https://twostorymelody.com/spotify-pay-per-stream/#:~:text=In%202022%20iGroove%20study%20showed%20that%20%240.003%20to%20%240.005%20is%20what%20Spotify%20pays%20per%20stream%20on%20average%2C%20meaning%201%2C000%20Spotify%20streams%20will%20pay%20you%20%243%20to%20%245.">between $0.003 and $0.005</a> cents per stream, and royalties are split among a much broader group than just the performers.</p>
<p>This arrangement pushes artists to tour more, because it‚Äôs one of the few remaining ways to be compensated and make a living as a musician. But while on the road, performers are subject to Live Nation‚Äôs cuts from ticket sales, as well as additional profiteering by venue owners and promoters.<br><br>Artists typically must fork over 20 percent to 30 percent of revenue on all merchandise sales after the show to the venue owner, which is often Live Nation, despite this being one of the last remaining avenues for bands to make money. Few fans even realize they‚Äôre handing over more money to companies like Live Nation when they‚Äôre buying a T-shirt after seeing their favorite band ‚Äî and some <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/10/7/23389885/square-toast-tipping-retail-tipflation-guilt">may complain</a> when asked to tip.</p>
<p>Artists who try to evade venues taking cuts from merchandise sales could potentially face backlash from promoters and venue owners. With Live Nation‚Äôs expansive reach throughout the industry, such actions could potentially be a career-killer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe have been told by our team many times in the past that we better pay our merch cut and pay it honestly, or we will mess up future opportunities for ourselves. How is this not extortion?‚Äù said Jesse Barnett, singer in the hardcore band Stick To Your Guns. ‚ÄúWe will show up to a venue and many places will physically count the amount of items we are bringing in and then count us out because they don‚Äôt trust that we will give them a ‚Äòcorrect number.‚Äô Why would we? Why do you deserve a piece of our merch? Did you come up with the designs? Did you get it printed? Did you haul it from show to show? No. Bottom line.‚Äù</p>
<p>Several musical artists spoke to <em>The Lever</em> on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of retaliation from Live Nation. All of them expressed frustration with merchandise cuts, but say they had been told there was nothing they could do to challenge them.</p>
<p>With artists and fans alike being nickeled and dimed by industry titans, Collins of Eve 6 worries about a future where upcoming artists won‚Äôt be able to tour.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe really are moving toward a future ‚Äî if we aren‚Äôt already there ‚Äî where the only artists who can afford to tour are at the Taylor Swift-, Harry Styles-position on the hierarchy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEve 6 did a month-long tour in May and June of this year, and when we looked at the profits and expenses afterwards we were like, ‚ÄòWelp, we won‚Äôt be doing this again.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="swifties-on-the-attack">Swifties On The Attack</h3>
<p>But now, finally, Live Nation might have messed with the wrong fan base. Swifties ‚Äî the moniker for Taylor Swift‚Äôs army of strident fans ‚Äî were roiled last Tuesday when Ticketmaster‚Äôs <a href="https://www.insider.com/ticketmaster-wont-explain-ran-out-taylor-swift-tickets-eras-tour-2022-11">site buckled</a> under the weight of millions of fans trying to snatch up tickets during a limited pre-release for fans chosen at random for her upcoming tour.</p>
<p>The public release was initially scheduled for Friday, but was ultimately postponed due to what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23464939/ticketmaster-taylor-swift-eras-tour-public-sale-canceled">Ticketmaster claimed</a> were ‚Äúextraordinarily high demands‚Äù and ‚Äúinsufficient remaining ticket inventory.‚Äù This pushed the remaining fans to the secondary, resale market where they were subject to prices <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/taylor-swift-resale-ticket-prices-soar-past-28000-amid-fan-frenzy-2022-11-16/">upwards of $28,000</a>.</p>
<p>This debacle comes on the heels of Ticketmaster‚Äôs ‚ÄúDynamic Pricing‚Äù controversy, a practice where prices for tickets are fluid and driven by demand, resulting in fans attempting to attend the most popular tours being charged rates much higher than face value. While Dynamic Pricing started in 2011, it drew ire at multiple points this year when fans of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/your-money/bruce-springsteen-tickets.html">Bruce Springsteen</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gx34/blink-182-tickets-are-so-expensive-because-ticketmaster-is-a-disastrous-monopoly-and-now-everyone-pays-ticket-broker-prices">Blink-182</a> were flabbergasted by the astronomical ticket prices and the site‚Äôs infrastructure cratering.</p>
<p>Mark Hoppus, the bassist and co-lead vocalist for Blink-182, acknowledged he tried to buy tickets to two of his shows after hearing what fans were enduring and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/mark-hoppus-tried-to-buy-blink-182-tour-tickets-i-had-tickets-yoinked-from-my-cart-and-the-whole-thing-crash-out">said his tickets were ‚Äúyoinked‚Äù</a> from his cart and he had ‚Äúthe whole thing crash out.‚Äù Conversely, Bruce Springsteen defended the Dynamic Pricing model in an interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bruce-springsteen-covers-lp-fan-outrage-ticket-prices-1234632658/">published last Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Swifties‚Äô ire, calls for Ticketmaster, and ultimately Live Nation Entertainment, to be broken up grew on social media last week and were echoed by prominent political figures.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDaily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly, its merger with LiveNation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned [sic] in. Break them up,‚Äù Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1592587226801934336?s=20&t=edfZ5pOYS5zkVyVUPAN_tQ">tweeted last week</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFans of Taylor Swift are learning firsthand about the Ticketmaster horror show and it‚Äôs not pretty Swifties. Break up Ticketmaster,‚Äù Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) <a href="https://twitter.com/BillPascrell/status/1593362586162155521">said in a tweet</a>. Pascrell <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3248?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22concert+ticketing%22%2C%22concert%22%2C%22ticketing%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=10">introduced a bill</a> in the 116th Congress aimed at regulating live-event ticket sales and ticket resale markets, as well as providing more transparency in pricing and fees. That bill stalled in committee.</p>
<p>Gregory Maffei, chairman of Live Nation‚Äôs board, is a prolific Republican donor who has given <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Greg+Maffei&contributor_employer=liberty&min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&max_date=11%2F20%2F2022">more than $900,000</a> to conservative candidates and causes since the start of the 2016 election cycle. He blamed Taylor Swift‚Äôs touring hiatus over the last several years for Ticketmaster‚Äôs issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBuilding capacity for peak demand is something we attempt to do but this exceeded every expectation. And the reality is Taylor Swift hasn‚Äôt been on the road for three or four years and that‚Äôs caused a huge issue,‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/econliberties/status/1593264401934696451?s=20&t=jygal7yRYTWjY33sMhZrnQ">said Maffei</a>.</p>
<p>Fans weren‚Äôt convinced.</p>
<p>‚ÄúObviously it was disappointing to see the way Ticketmaster had chosen to handle things ‚Äî knowing there were other Swifties who, like me, waited for hours in line and then were unable to get tickets,‚Äù said Ellie Schnitt, host of the <em>Taylor Talk</em> podcast on Spotify. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no excuse for it, they knew the demand would be insane and said they could handle it and there was literally no other option.‚Äù</p>
<p>The outcry comes at a moment of growing demands for consumer rights in the face of predatory corporate behaviors. The Biden administration, along with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/">made it a priority to crack down</a> on companies and institutions that engage in unscrupulous pricing practices or levy hefty and unnecessary ‚Äújunk fees‚Äù on purchases. The industries range from the financial sector to airlines to the live event ticketing world.</p>
<p>Last week, Pascrell and 31 other Democratic members of the House <a href="https://pascrell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5229">released a letter</a> calling on Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Live Nation for its business practices and demanding the corporation be broken up.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is overwhelming evidence that the merger between the world‚Äôs largest concert promoter and the largest ticket provider strangled competition for ticketing in the live entertainment marketplace,‚Äù wrote the lawmakers. ‚ÄúWhile the harm consumers and artists have endured for over a decade cannot be reversed, ticketing and venue competitors, fans, and local music communities would breathe a collective sigh of relief if the merger were undone.‚Äù</p>

<p>That same day, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that the DOJ has launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/technology/live-nation-ticketmaster-investigation-taylor-swift.html">an antitrust investigation</a> into LiveNation Entertainment. In a statement published Friday evening, the company issued a statement claiming it ‚Äúdoes not engage in behaviors that could justify antitrust litigation, let alone orders that would require it to alter fundamental business practices.‚Äù</p>
<p>In its annual financial report earlier this year, the company acknowledged that antitrust investigations may pose substantial risk to its business.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the case of antitrust (and similar or related) matters,‚Äù the company wrote, ‚Äúany adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally (or in a particular segment thereof) or subject us to potential damage assessments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.‚Äù </p>
