<p>The ravages of the car theft crime spree has finally reached a dealership in Winchester, Tennessee. According to the Winchester Police Department, on the night of November 9 or in the early morning of November 10 the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/indias-biggest-car-thief/">thief</a> swiped a 2021 Shelby GT500 from Russell Barnett Ford. It should be pretty easy to spot thanks to the Twister Orange gracing those lovely body panels. We’re sure the thief or thieves thought this snake looks pretty sweet and just had to have it.</p>

<p>Look, car thieves have been targeting dealerships for a long time, but the trend seems to be stepping up lately as car theft in general is on an upswing. Sadly, this affects areas like Winchester, especially when they have a sweet, sweet Shelby just sitting there and thieves think that means it’s up for grabs. We’re not blaming the victim here, but we’re wondering just what kind of security they had, because we keep seeing thieves easily break into the key safe so they can just drive off with whatever.</p>

<p>Now, we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves here but this might shape up to be a top 10 police chase, maybe top 5. After all, the Shelby GT500 packs a muscular 760-horsepower, so it’s one spicy pony and would easily outgun just about any police cruiser out there. Unless the Winchester Police Department has a Dodge Hellcat Redeye hiding in its fleet, there’s no way they could chase this thing down in a pursuit. However, they have the might of Motorola or the radio, plus stop sticks cops seems to struggle with deploying, etc. We hope they catch them, but if some crazy chase ensues beforehand that could be interesting and also dangerous, but entertaining.</p>

<p>Currently there’s a $10,000 reward for the recovery of the Shelby GT500. If you know anything about this car, Winchester Police want to hear from you, or you can contact Crimestoppers.</p>
