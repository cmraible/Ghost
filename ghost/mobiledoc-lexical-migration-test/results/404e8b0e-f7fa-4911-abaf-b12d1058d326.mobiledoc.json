That means fewer people can qualify for loans to buy those ever-more-expensive new vehicles. Even if they do qualify, their purchasing power is diminished, meaning they get less car for their money than ever before."

Elon Musk last week said he believes the Federal Reserve is too busy looking at what’s been happening with inflation that it’s taking the wrong trajectory. Instead of forecasting what’s coming down the road, the Fed has been ratcheting up interest rates at a time when Musk, and others, believe deflation is the next part of this economic rollercoaster."

For example, deflation from 1929 to 1932 in the United States resulted in a loss of demand for certain goods and services as people held onto their money longer. That, in turn, led to mass layoffs for many workers."
