          " is a 2D platformer with a pixel art style reminiscent of the Game Boy Advance. It's a title I've been keeping my eye on for a while now over on Twitter, watching the many posts from the developer and seeing it grow in popularity.  As the game starts off, our main character Pablo the Dog is walking with his friends near a strange looking temple, only to accidentally awaken a dark machine that is intent on destroying the world by using strange ancient artifacts. Pablo watches as the evil machine destroys the island he‚Äôs on and is then thrown off into the freezing waters below. After being rescued by his friends, he must act quickly to retrieve all of the artifacts and restore peace to the lands. With his trusty Grapple hook, Pablo must jump into action and thwart the plans of the machine that threatens his home."

More advanced objects like the green stomp pads only work when stomped on and floating water bubbles allow you to swim in mid-air and shoot out watery orbs to move over spikes and other obstacles.  Each new mechanic is slowly introduced over the course of the six worlds, slowly ramping up the complexity. Your little furry friend can walk, dash, stomp and use his grapple hook in various different directions which is indicated by the little white arrow above his head. The grapple can attach to any blue block, allowing you to swing across gaps with ease. By adding in the dash ability and swinging on blue orbs, you can cover a lot of distance when putting these two abilities together; it comes in handy during some of the later stages and in the time-trial runs which are unlocked once you complete a stage."

There‚Äôs a real incentive to collect everything as after you've completed a stage, you‚Äôll want to return to uncover things that you might have missed on the first playthrough, extending your replayability considerably. There's even some special extra accessibility options in the menu screen, allowing even children to enjoy the game by granting the ability to jump continuously or not be hurt by any oncoming damage; this is a nice inclusion by the developer and is always welcomed. Stages offer plenty of challenges for those who seek it and that also includes the boss battles that need to be cleared to progress."
