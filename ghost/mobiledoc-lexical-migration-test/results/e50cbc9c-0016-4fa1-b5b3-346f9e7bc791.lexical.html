<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We recently busted open the story of the Biden campaign promoting GOP talking points, and Biden’s campaign was just forced to publicly retreat on MSNBC.</p>
<p><strong>This is the kind of journalism we do and its having a huge impact — and we really, really need you to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to become a supporting subscriber to help us expand.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what happened — we originally published <a href="__GHOST_URL__/team-biden-now-signals-austerity">this story</a> on a top Biden adviser promoting GOP talking points about budget deficits as a rationale to undermine major progressive priorities. Biden’s campaign had to issue a statement retreating. Now, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes just challenged the Biden campaign to explain itself — and he noted that after pressure, Biden’s campaign was forced to back off.</p>

<p>This entire situation proves that our journalism is having a major impact — but in order to continue making that impact, we truly need as many people as possible to become supporting subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>Please click here</strong></a><strong> to become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber to help us hire more journalists and hold both parties’ feet to the fire.</strong></p>
<p>I cannot reiterate how important this is — we can make this kind of impact every single day when we are able to hire more reporters. That’s what we do with subscriber revenues. And here’s the thing: when you become a subscriber you get plenty of subscriber-only content.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering this request — I know times are tough right now, but this kind of work is so critical.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
