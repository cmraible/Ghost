This became especially prevalent within the automotive industry as the entire sector was fighting to end one of the worst wars that the Allied forces had ever been involved in. The constant battle of the mid to late 1930s and 1940s to be the most significant technological innovator of the era birthed vehicles such as this tank. Tales of a storied war-riddled past are written all over this tank in the form of aged body marks and dents all over. Let's take a look at this incredible tank from the early 1930s.",
