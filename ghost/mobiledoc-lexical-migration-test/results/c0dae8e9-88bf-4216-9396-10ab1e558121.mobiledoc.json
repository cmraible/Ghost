Amazingly, this car only has 24,000 miles which is pretty insane when you think about how funniest cars are to drive and how long ago this one was built. However, that vehicle wasn’t the one "

With only 11,000 miles on the odometer, this was something that Dennis really hoped to purchase but inevitably was not able to. However, it was the 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Z 28 that cheered him up. He certainly didn’t let the Corvette bring his hopes down when he inevitably couldn’t purchase it and found a new joy in this classic. With its numbers-matching 302 in.³ V-8 engine, the team should have a lot of fun restoring this beauty taking it to all kinds of shows and races."
