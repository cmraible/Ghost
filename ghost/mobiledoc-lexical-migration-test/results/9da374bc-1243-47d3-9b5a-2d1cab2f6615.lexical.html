<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/mopar-sema-concept-drawings/">SEMA Show in Las Vegas</a> is coming up quick and to get us all excited we get a nice preview of a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjE5NjkiLCJicm9uY28iXX0=">1969 Ford Bronco</a> which is really a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-econoline-rescued/">1972 Ford Econoline van</a> mixed with a 1969 Ford Ranger long bed. That’s not something you see really ever, so this build should turn plenty of heads and gather quite the crowd in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/las-vegas-gearhead-mansion/">Sin City</a>.</p>

<p>Created by Keith Kyker of Kyker’s Rod & Kustom out of Telford, Tennessee, you’ll notice this truck <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-lowrider-truck-event-and-cry/">rides real low</a>. It uses an AccuAir suspension system for that almost ground-scraping stance. Hidden behind the fenders are Billet Specialties Bonneville wheels painted a PPG basecoat of Kasmenine Bronze, a color which is also featured on the engine and chassis.</p>

<p>The roof comes from the Econoline, which has been cut to make the build look like the full-size first-gen Bronco Ford never made. Some people will really dig the creative genius it took to even come up with such a concept, although we suspect some purists will automatically be offended.</p>
<p>Unlike most modern Ford builds, this one isn’t rocking a Coyote V8. Instead, under the hood is a Ford 429 big block V8, a true performance icon. Instead of just a factory-spec mill, this one has been modified with a Comp Cams 268H camshaft and a Quick Fuel carb, taking full advantage of the lower center of gravity for more explosive acceleration on straightaways and coming out of turns.</p>

<p>In an interesting move, this restomod doesn’t have a decidedly modern interior. Instead, the classic look and feel has been overall preserved. However, distressed brown leather from Speedway Seatcovers adds a little something extra to make it all pop.</p>
