One of the most common mistakes made is taking a vehicle that’s not capable on a pathway, getting it stuck easily. Usually it’s some crossover with all-wheel drive (or even worse, front-wheel drive) that the owner thought was a hardcore rig because the automaker aired a commercial where it splashes through a stream before chasing down a 10-point buck in an open field. But this is the first time I’ve seen someone take a Dodge Challenger on a trail."

Admittedly, I probably wouldn’t have been as nice as Matt was about this recovery operation, but then again he’s a true professional and genuinely nice guy. The man is pulling people out of the consequences of their stupid decisions all the time and he doesn’t harass a single one – absolutely amazing. He keeps his cool even when the Dodge is stuck in deep sand."

Gee, this is a hard one: maybe just maybe this guy who thought off-roading a Challenger damaged the cooling system, causing all the coolant to empty onto the sand as he marveled at how far he was getting on the trail? With any luck a few coyotes will lap it up later."

Somehow, Matt doesn’t just haul off and tell this guy to hand in his man card because he doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing."

Realizing they couldn’t pull the portly muscle car out of the sand, they called the guy you really want to show up in this situation."

He’s a bigger man than I am, that’s for sure. I wonder if he said anything in his head, because how could you not? Some people just don’t get what off-roading is all about, like not at all."
