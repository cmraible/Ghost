Pretty much every musician in that genre likes to gather a ton of vehicles. However, that’s usually all about being boastful, arrogant, and showing your wealth. For Mr. Ross it seems to be a true passion and his latest purchase really sells that point home because it’s just so cool."

That is, of course, the fact that it’s very subtle. You don’t see a massive set of wheels or some crazy color combination like you might expect from one of his other vehicles. Rather, like most of his classics, this one is tasteful and elegant to the highest degree."

If that sounds familiar to you, then you must know a lot about the SS of that year because that’s exactly what this car is. As the Rick Ross car collection, and subsequent show, continues to expand, we’re all pretty excited to see what other cars are going to be added. However, this Camaro really takes the cake for a subtle nature and honoring an American automotive icon."
