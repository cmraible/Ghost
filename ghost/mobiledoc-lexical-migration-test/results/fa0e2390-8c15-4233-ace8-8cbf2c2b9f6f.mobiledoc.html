<hr>
<p>We spend a lot of time cleaning our cars and looking for new ways to make them <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/the-coolest-off-roaders-on-motorious/">look their best</a>. Many of us have tried out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/the-coolest-off-roaders-on-motorious/">an impressive selection</a> of different polishes, waxes, wheel cleaners, and detailing tools, and we've all got cabinets <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/datsun-280zs-first-bath-44-years/">packed full of chemicals</a> to show for it.</p>
<p>One area that doesn't get the attention it deserves is our glass. Most of us are content to pick out a glass cleaner (or use the bottle under the kitchen sink) and call it a day. If you give your glass the attention it deserves, though, you'll be rewarded with a noticeable improvement in your car's appearance.</p>

<p>We've assembled a collection of videos, which cover the removal of hard water spots, cleaning the outside of the glass, and cleaning the inside of the glass. We've also made a handy list of the supplies you'll need:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
<ul>
    <li>a collection of microfiber towels</li>
    <li>a large bath or beach towel</li>
    <li>an empty cup or container</li>
    <li>a warm water source</li>
    <li>glass cleaner</li>
    <li>Bar Keeper's Friend</li>
    <li>paint cleaning clay</li>
    <li>paste wax</li>
    <li>Mr. Clean Magic Eraser or similar</li>
</ul><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
<p>If you've got everything you need, let's start with the outside. This first video, by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPixKydtianMPzfAmYD8jrQ">more jello please</a> shows how easy it is to remove hard water stains on your glass. We see this type of staining most often on sunroofs.</p>

<p>First, you need to clean your glass with a microfiber towel and the cleaner of your choice. We prefer a foaming aerosol cleaner, but whatever you like best is just fine.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/1111201502_HDR.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/1111201502_HDR.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/1111201502_HDR.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/1111201502_HDR.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/1111201502_HDR.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>Once the glass is clean, mix up a solution of Bar Keeper's Friend and warm water in your empty cup, as shown in the video. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution, and work in a circular motion using light pressure.</p>
<p>Next, you can finish up with an up and down motion, followed by a side to side motion. Wipe off the residue with a clean, dry towel, and clean your glass again. Repeat as necessary until your hard water spots are gone.</p>

<p>Next, we're going to make the glass shine like you've never seen before and repel water, too. This video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCes1EvRjcKU4sY_UEavndBw">ChrisFix</a> will show us how to get it done.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJkfrY2owb0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p>First, clean your glass with a microfiber towel and your glass cleaner. If you already cleaned it after getting the water spots off, you can skip this step – just be sure you cleaned the edges of the glass, near the trim. Dirt tends to collect in those areas.</p>
<p>After a good cleaning, you'll use some warm water to lubricate paint cleaning clay to remove contaminants embedded in the glass. After you've finished up with the clay bar, clean the glass again.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/1115201722b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/1115201722b.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/1115201722b.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/1115201722b.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/1115201722b.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>The final step may surprise you. Buff some regular old-fashioned paste wax onto your glass with a microfiber towel or an applicator and let it sit for a few minutes. Be sure to remove any wax from the trim quickly so that you don't end up with unsightly white spots.</p>
<p>When the wax is completely dried, buff it off with a clean microfiber towel. This leaves an incredible clear shine, and as an added bonus, it repels rain water, too! Be sure to clean your windshield wiper blades, or else you'll just get the glass dirty again. We think this is a perfect time to replace them.</p>

<p>Next, we'll clean the inside glass to that same standard. After cleaning and waxing the outside glass, the haze on the inside of the glass is more apparent than ever.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axI5Luw0Eos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p>Cleaning the inside of the glass is a perfect final step for making your car look its absolute best. To start off, simply wipe the glass down with a clean microfiber towel to prepare it for the deep clean.</p>
<p>If your windows have been tinted, just use soap and water to clean them to avoid damaging the film. Otherwise, get some warm water in a cup and your Magic Eraser, and start scrubbing. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/1115201659d_HDR.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/1115201659d_HDR.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/1115201659d_HDR.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/1115201659d_HDR.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/1115201659d_HDR.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>It's a good idea to place a large towel on your dashboard and interior panels to catch drips. You don't want the cleaning chemicals to discolor your interior trim.</p>
<p>After you've scrubbed with the Magic Eraser, clean up the water left behind with a  clean microfiber towel before it dries. As a finishing touch, clean the glass one more time with glass cleaner. When you're working on the inside glass, it's a better idea to spray the cleaner directly onto your detailing towel. That way, you don't risk discoloring plastic with the overspray</p>

<p>Now, your glass should be crystal clear inside and out. Your glass looks great, repels rain, and best of all, it's easier to see out of. Happy cleaning!</p>
