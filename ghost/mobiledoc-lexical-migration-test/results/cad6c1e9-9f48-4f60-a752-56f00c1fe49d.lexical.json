And so it has been proved.\n\nThe only question was: who and when?\n\n\n## An Independent transition – to online only\n\n![A death of print is announced](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2016/02/indy-print-death.jpg?resize=960%2C617)\n\nAnd now the question has been answered. The tiny (just over 40k paid copies a day), loss-making [*Independent* is closing its print edition](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/the-independent-becomes-the-first-national-newspaper-to-embrace-a-global-digital-only-future-a6869736.html), and going online-only. There’s part of me that’s deeply sad about this. I remember the launch of *The Independent*, and was a loyal reader for years, valuing both its exceptional photography and independent stance. And its lack of royalty coverage. But that *Indy* is long gone. Today’s notice of the killing of the print edition is more like seeing an old friend’s suffering finally end.\n\nCome March, [*The Independent* will be an online-only national news site](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/independent-and-independent-sunday-newspapers-closed-after-i-sale-johnston-press?platform=hootsuite). And now the conversation changes.\n\n\n## New questions for a new age\n\nThis shift raises a whole bunch of new questions, like:\n\n> Who is next?\n\nFolks on Twitter have been suggesting answers:\n\n> [@adders](https://twitter.com/adders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@kevglobal](https://twitter.com/kevglobal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@marksweney](https://twitter.com/marksweney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) the guardian\n> \n> — Tom Goodwin (@tomfgoodwin) [February 12, 2016](https://twitter.com/tomfgoodwin/status/698134293269368832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n> [@johncthompson](https://twitter.com/johncthompson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@adders](https://twitter.com/adders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Express.\n> \n> — RickWaghorn (@RickJWaghorn) [February 12, 2016](https://twitter.com/RickJWaghorn/status/698128471134965760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n> [@adders](https://twitter.com/adders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) If Murdoch shuffles off his mortal coil sometime soon, my money would be on the Times.\n> \n> — John Thompson (@johncthompson) [February 12, 2016](https://twitter.com/johncthompson/status/698128191798558720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nIf I had to put money on it, I’d choose one of the tabloids. I think the remaining “qualities’ all have things going for them, but the sort of content the red-tops (and even the *Express*) peddle is so abundant and free online that the print edition is only valuable through convenience and nostalgia.\n\n\n## *The Independent* in intensive care\n\nEqually important is:\n\n> Will *The Independent* survive the transition?\n\nThat’s an interesting question. With my “digital journalist” head on, there are some deeply fundamental weaknesses to the site. The staff show a lack of awareness of some crucial digital skills, and much of their copy could be run in print, with no modifications. If they’re to survive as a digital business, they need to get more digitally savvy. There’s also the problem that we’re deeply over-supplied online with both general news and opinion pieces. Trading off just those is no recipe for success. Selling a commodity product is a hard enterprise.\n\nThe online-only *Independent* needs to be as innovative and distinctive as the print *Independent* was back in the 80s.\n\nToday’s news marks a turning of the wheel. Before, the majority of the public conversations were about running print and digital in parallel. (The ones behind closed doors were somewhat different in tone.).\n\n- The first epoch was digital as an adjunct or marketing tool for print.\n- The second was print and digital as equal partners.\n\nWe’re now starting the transition into the their epoch: the age of print decline. We don’t know how deep it will go – and I don’t think it’ll die completely – but once you start accepting that, the whole economics of the news business change.\n\nAs the cliché goes – fasten your seatbelt. It’s going to be a bumpy few years for these former icons of the industry. And not all of them will survive the flight…\n\n\n"
