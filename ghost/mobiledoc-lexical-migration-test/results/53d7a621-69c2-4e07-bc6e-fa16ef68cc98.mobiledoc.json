Now we have people swiping wheels off parked cars, as shown in a video of two thieves stealing a wheel off a C8 Corvette in Texas. Actually, this isn’t anything new, but the local news sure seems shocked such a thing would happen and so “quickly.”"

Steal wheels and the tires mounted on them is anything but a new trend – it’s been going on for decades. But the video of the C8 wheel theft seems to introduce a new concept."

What about Formula One? If anything, the two guys swiping the wheel are slow, especially since they have a hydraulic jack and what appears to be an impact driver."
