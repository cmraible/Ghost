Thankfully, the three adults and one teenager transported to the hospital were all in stable condition. News footage showed people on stretchers being worked on by emergency first responders. We’ve seen far too many fatal accidents like this. If you want to enjoy your performance car, please don’t drive like a complete idiot."
