As pointed out in the report, Glencore admitted to manipulating the oil market in May at the same time Americans paid dearly at the pump. The U.S. Department of Justice settled with the company, requiring it to pay $1.1 billion in fines and forfeitures. Some thought Glencore got off easy."

          "Tesla’s ties to Glencore doesn’t involve oil and gas but instead cobalt, a mineral necessary for the manufacture of electric car batteries. That’s where things get truly seedy. As you might already know, cobalt mines too often employ children in horrific conditions, damaging their health and the local environment. Glencore reportedly is supplying Tesla with at least 6,000 tons of cobalt a year, a number which might have to increase as Tesla aims to churn out 2 million EVs a year."

If it does find a way to successful wean itself off the mineral, Tesla would also sidestep entanglements with an industry which has a history of human rights abuses. Still, the automaker maintains it uses companies which safeguard humans involved in the mining process and which are otherwise ethical in their mining practices."

Gertler has been sanctioned from the U.S. financial system since 2017 thanks to the U.S. Department of the Treasury  leveling accusations of corruption. Legal experts seem split on what kind of risk Tesla is taking using an intermediary to work with Gertler."

The process of extracting cobalt and other necessary minerals to make the batteries, not to mention the manufacturing process itself, come at a steep cost, one which seems to look worse as more is discovered."
