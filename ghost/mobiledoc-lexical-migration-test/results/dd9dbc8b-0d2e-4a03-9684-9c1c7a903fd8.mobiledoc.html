<p>There’s something undeniably alluring about vintage SUVs. They were out rolling over rocks, hauling deer carcasses, and serving as base camp for real outdoorsmen long before it was cool to drive something with four-wheel drive to Whole Foods. Even better is something like this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/168304/1972-chevrolet-blazer-supercharged">1972 Chevrolet Blazer</a>, which has gone through a nice restomod to add more power and some luxuries the truck didn’t originally provide.</p>

<p>This SUV is powerful, thanks to the Weiand supercharger blowing the 350ci V8. Combined with a 4-barrel Holley double pumper carb. You’ll love popping the hood, not only to make everyone wow at all that muscle, but also because several parts like the air cleaner, valve covers, and supercharger are chromed out. A 3-speed automatic transmission and dual chambered mufflers complete the setup.</p>

<p>Just a quick inspection makes it obvious this Blazer has been through a complete restoration. The red paint is absolutely like glass, shined to perfection so you could part your hair looking at one of the body panels. There are some nice details on the exterior, like the brushed grille and headlight casings, really setting this apart from other Blazers. Punching things up further are the modern HID headlights, so you don’t struggle to see on a dark road. As you no doubt have noticed, this Chevy has been lowered for better handling, making it more of a street machine than a trail runner. Nice polished wheels and a removable top make this SUV absolutely fantastic to take to any show.</p>
<p>While a great exterior is important, the interior of this Blazer really pulls everything together. It’s obvious everything was planned out in advance, down to the last detail. The leather seats have gray and a red that matches the body, which match the doors and dash. The same gray on the seats is applied to the rim of the billet steering wheel and the padded top of the dash, while a slightly different shade of gray graces the carpeting. Billet aluminum on the gauge panel, a front center console with cupholders, and large storage compartment really round out this interior.</p>
<p>To say the Chevrolet Blazer was a popular SUV would be a huge understatement. 1972 was the final model year for the coveted first generation. You won’t find another one customized like this one, making it that much more original.
