<p>Call it the one that got away for any of you who would’ve and could’ve bid on this custom 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham Station Wagon during the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/you-will-see-the-black-ghost/">Mecum Auctions Indy 2023</a> event, this classic ended up selling. That’s really not shocking considering the drop-dead gorgeous ride, nicknamed CadMad, was the 2019 Autorama Riddler winner and has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/learn-this-old-school-firebirds-backstory/">caught the eye</a> of many enthusiasts as well as collectors.</p>

<p>That long, luscious shape is perfectly accentuated by the Fawntana Rose and Titanium Silver exterior for a presentation that’s guaranteed to earn many longing looks. That impeccable presentation continues to the Rose interior with many fine details.</p>
<p>You might be remarking at what a unique ride CadMad is while racking your brain to remember if you saw one of these when they were new. That’s not likely considering this build was achieved by merging an already exceptionally rare 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Broughams with a 1956 Chevrolet Nomad. That required 4,000 hours to complete and we think that effort was well spent.</p>

<p>Underneath that long hood sits a Tom Nelson Racing engines 632ci V8 packing a crushing 1,025-horsepower. That kind of power doesn’t exactly come cheap and this particular mill set the owner back $97,000. Guaranteeing accessibility in this age of convenience is an automatic transmission. The fact this thing is tuned to run on racing fuel adds to its intrigue.</p>
<p>According to Mecum’s lot listing, the former owner of this custom Caddie spent 15 years building it, attending to every single last detail on the car. Looking at the photos, it most definitely shows. That person also spent $2.3 million on the project, an honest assessment we don’t always get when people talk about their customized rides.</p>
