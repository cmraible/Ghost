With that kind of money, he certainly had cash to waste, and while we wouldn’t exactly say this car is a waste, it certainly requires someone to have left over money to want to make it.

Seeing that it’s built on an Acura NSX platform, it’s really a pretty impressive build. The dimensions are spot on and a lot of parts come from Lamborghini OEM, which includes the scissor doors and emblems."

Instead, the manual transmission car only makes a fraction of that at 270 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque."
