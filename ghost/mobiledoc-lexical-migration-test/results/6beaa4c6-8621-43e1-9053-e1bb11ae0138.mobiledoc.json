However aside from that, the presentation just feels lacklustre and due to the game having one (and only one) mode, get used to seeing black backgrounds, oddly shiny cinema chairs and sillhouettes of the back of heads from the 90s."

The lines being delivered by a female robot who's almost given up on her forced, insentient lifestyle that consists of reading out fart and genital jokes creates an oddly hilarious touch. Top that off with generic elevator music and it's like when so much bad does a full circle and becomes good... just like this review!"
