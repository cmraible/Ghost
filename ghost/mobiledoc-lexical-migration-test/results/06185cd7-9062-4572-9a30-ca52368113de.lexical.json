The ultra-rare Porsche was highly desired as it went up for auction with a starting bid of $30 million, a starting price that shocked bidders considering that it was only expected to sell for $20 million. The desire for the car outweighed the price, and the bidding war eventually reached $70 million. However, the auction house made a mistake, and the bid went back down to $17 million instead which caused mass confusion among potential buyers. Many people booed and walked out, and the car did not reach its reserve price. The car never sold or exchanged hands. If they had kept the $70 million bid, it would have been the most expensive car to sell at auction by a staggering $20 million.",

The plan was to produce a limited run of 50 cars, but due to the cost of the project, it was abandoned leaving this example as the only one in existence. Sent to Dallas, the car was sold to James Hadden and James Gormon, who modified the gearbox for drag racing. Back in 1970, the car was purchased by Bobby Pierce of Texas who held onto the car for 25 years. After that, the car was sent to Florida where it changed hands a few times before it was purchased by a collector who lightly restored the car. Shelby collector John Wickey had previously owned the car, and he found it in his hands again.",

The cars taken by U.S. Marshals ranged from regular run-of-the-mill vehicles to hot rods, sports cars, luxury cars, dirt bikes, and even a motorhome. One car that stood out from the crowd is this 2007 Shelby Mustang that went for a staggering $1 million, and it has an interesting story behind it. Just weeks after the Las Vegas mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, this car crossed the auction block to help raise money for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's injured officers. What makes this Super Snake even more unique is that is sports VIN xxx007, the seventh one built after the namesake's rebirth in 2007. This specific Shelby was also owned by Ford's previous CEO, Mark Fields, and it sold this time for over $167k. Other cars worth noting include a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon, 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle Pro-Street, 2002 Dodge Viper RT/10, 1993 AM General pickup, 2014 Fiat 500, 2014 Jaguar XKR-S GT, 1968 Plymouth GTX Hemi, and a 2017 Cadillac CTS-V.",
