The only button that the game uses that the NES controller doesn't have is the R button which is used to sprint, but you can also simply press the directional button twice - that works, too."

You can also purchase a fighter drone that will fight alongside you temporarily, which are great during boss fights. This then brings me to the game's Amiibo functionality (there's something I haven't said in quite a while). I only own the Shovel Knight Amiibo where you can call upon the titular knight to fight alongside you in lieu of the drone.

You'll grit your teeth and concede defeat, carrying on throughout the level until you realise that an upgrade further on allows you to go back and solve the puzzle.
