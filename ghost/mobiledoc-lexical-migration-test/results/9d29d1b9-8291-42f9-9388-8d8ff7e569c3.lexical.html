<p>Now that the House of Representatives finally has a Speaker, the 2023 Congress is officially up and running. On <em>Lever Time</em>, we spoke with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) about the current congressional state of affairs. We dug into his ongoing House Oversight investigation into the fossil fuel industry, the recent airline industry fiasco, and how progressive House members plan to wield power now that Republicans control the chamber. </p>
<p>Last week, <em>The Audit</em>‚Äôs study group completed its second season, in which they audited political consultants David Axelrod and Karl Rove‚Äôs MasterClass on campaign strategy. You can now listen to the entire season ‚Äî and make sure to go back and listen to their first season, in which the study group audited George W. Bush‚Äôs MasterClass on leadership. No, that isn‚Äôt a typo.</p>
