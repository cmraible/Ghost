Celebrities like Jay Leno, whose lives revolve around vintage vehicles of the most desirable classes, typically some particularly desirable models. One man, known for his part on the show American Pickers, has recently received a lot of attention for his vast collection. While some have pointed out its incredible valuation, worth around $243,000, the rarity and unique vehicles featured in the group are far more interesting. So what sort of vehicle piques the interest of a professional vintage artifact finder?",

This is a high value of extreme proportions for a utility-based vehicle and is one that would likely surprise many automotive enthusiasts. Another classic car that boasts similarly high importance is the 1959 Chevrolet El Camino which also reflects a combination of history, performance, and a unique design.",
