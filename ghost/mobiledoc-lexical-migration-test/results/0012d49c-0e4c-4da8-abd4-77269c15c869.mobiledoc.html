<p>Because party committees are subject to contribution limits, the groups often have lobbyists “bundle” checks, which means the operatives collect payments from various colleagues and connections and then combine them into a larger total. In exchange, the lobbyists score access to key lawmakers.</p>
<p>New federal election records show that Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the group that works to elect Democratic House members, used check bundling to score roughly half a million dollars in donations during the first half of the year. Unfortunately, as the records reveal, those checks came courtesy of lobbyists with troubling corporate ties.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>During the first half of this year, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the party committee that works to elect Democratic candidates for House seats, brought in $483,000 worth of checks raised by a handful of business lobbyists with close ties to fossil fuel companies, pharmaceutical giants, and private equity firms, federal election <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/257/202107199451704257/202107199451704257.pdf">records</a> show.</p>
<p>Because party committees are subject to contribution limits, lobbyists sometimes work to collect checks from their colleagues and personal networks so they can pool larger cash totals. Bundling checks in this way for committees like the DCCC that serve as essential party infrastructure is a key method that corporate lobbyists use to buy access with lawmakers.</p>
<p>The new filings reveal that lobbyists Zachary Pfister and David Reid, from the legal juggernaut Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, used this process to raise a combined $283,000 for the DCCC during the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Pfister has lobbied for the <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/620fdb25-c3d9-4c23-9a6b-9c957b5783d1/print/">American Petroleum Institute</a>, a major lobbying group for oil and gas companies, and pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/2fc41a28-f778-405d-9661-6bb211afeeb5/print/">Johnson & Johnson</a>, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/0b79ac3f-47a1-4f82-a956-64e70c551c17/print/">Eli Lilly</a>, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/492b2300-b837-4474-938e-6f1d72d117d7/print/">Novartis</a>, and <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/1d66481b-c742-49fb-b251-bd22265aa16c/print/">AbbVie</a>.

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>Last month on <em>Meet the Press,</em> Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a leading Republican in the bipartisan negotiations over President Joe Biden’s proposed infrastructure package, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-june-20-2021-n1271502">said</a> strengthening the IRS’ enforcement arm was an important part of the proposal.</p>
<p>Doing so could raise up to $100 billion over the next ten years without increasing taxes, since it would help close the “tax gap” between what taxpayers owe and what they pay.</p>
<p>Much of that gap is due to the wealthy, who on average pay less in taxes than typical American workers. A recent <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">bombshell ProPublica report</a> found that billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Warren Buffett in some years paid next to nothing to the IRS.</p>
<p>“They should be paying taxes,” said Portman when asked if Jeff Bezos and Amazon should be contributing more to the country’s infrastructure. “And that’s actually part of our proposal, too. We have about a $63 billion pay-for that is hoping to close the tax gap that assumes about a $40 billion investment in the IRS, including, by the way, in better taxpayer service, which is really important right now, but also enforcement, and let`s be sure that we`re closing that tax gap.”</p>
<p>Now, however, closing that tax enforcement gap appears to be a dealbreaker for Portman and his colleagues.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Republicans forced the bipartisan group to remove increasing IRS funding from the proposal because, as Portman <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2107/18/sotu.01.html">told</a> CNN, the idea faced “pushback.” Earlier this month, major anti-tax conservative groups <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/letter-conservatives-irs-funding-taxes-mitch-mcconnell-bipartisan-infrastructure-biden-2021-7">sent a letter</a> to GOP leadership calling the infrastructure package a “basic betrayal of conservative values” and demanding “no additional funding for the Internal Revenue Service.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers are still scrambling to find alternative ways to fund the infrastructure package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is set to open debate on the infrastructure legislation today.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<ul>
    <li><strong>FRITO-LAY WORKER STRIKE GAINS TRACTION: </strong>A strike that began on July 5 when hundreds of workers <a href="https://labornotes.org/2021/07/we-want-see-our-families-frito-lay-workers-strike-over-84-hour-weeks-meager-raises">walked off their job at a Frito-Lay plant</a> in Topeka, Kansas, has gained national attention. Workers at the plant say they’ve been subjected to months of 84-hour work weeks with no days off, as the pandemic fueled a surge in spending on Tostitos, Fritos, Doritos, and other comfort foods that led Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo, to earn $5.3 billion in profits last year. Now Frito-Lay employees in other states are <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1416919789415636994">speaking out</a>, with reports surfacing of workers driven to exhaustion and suicide.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>JUSTICE DEPT. SLAMS PURDUE OPIOID BANKRUPTCY PLAN: </strong></strong>In new court briefs filed in New York, representatives of the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/19/1018028179/justice-department-blasts-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-plan">blasted</a> a proposed bankruptcy settlement for Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, for potentially granting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/opioid-billionaire-demand-sweeping-immunity/">sweeping immunity</a> to the Sacklers, the billionaire family behind the pharmaceutical giant, despite their prominent role in the country’s opioid crisis. U.S. Trustee William Harrington, who oversees federal bankruptcy cases in the region, called the potential settlement, which would protect the Sacklers and contacts in their business empire from lawsuits in exchange for the family contributing less than half of the $10 billion they allegedly made from opioid sales, “nothing less than an illegal, court-ordered discharge of a potentially limitless group of non-debtors.” The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York concurred, noting in a filing that the plan would violate the constitutional rights of those impacted by the opioid crisis. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/19/1018028179/justice-department-blasts-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-plan">According</a> to NPR, bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain “is widely expected to approve the Purdue Pharma settlement” at an August 9 hearing.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>HUCKSTER HITS THE HAMPTONS: </strong></strong>Venture capitalist and Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance, best known for writing <em>Hillbilly Eleg</em>y, his divisive memoir of growing up in Appalachia, recently tweeted that he was worried about an upcoming visit to New York because he’d heard “it’s disgusting and violent there” — without mentioning that he’d previously spent time in the city when he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-tax-avoiders-in-space/">met with bank lobbyists</a> at a swanky hotel. Vance apparently overcame his fears about the trip, because he was <a href="https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/1417136974541070337">spotted last weekend in Southampton</a>, mingling with GOP power brokers.</li>
