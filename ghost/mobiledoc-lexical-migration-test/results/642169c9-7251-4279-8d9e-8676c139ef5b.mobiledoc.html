<p>With <a href="https://427stingray.com/?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=Story+with+links&utm_campaign=427Stingray+Motorious&utm_id=Motorious&utm_term=corvette">427Stingray Corvette Auctions</a> starting the last week of August, the team at 427Stingray.com have a lot to be excited about as consignments are really starting to roll in. The first of two No Reserve auctions were consigned last week.</p>
<p>This NO RESERVE 1964 Chevrolet Corvette Convertible has a bright and iconic style that you get to enjoy to the fullest thanks to extra V8 power and four-on-the-floor. This is a chance of a lifetime for the one that has dreamed of a C2.</p>
<p>The Sting Ray is a legend on wheels. The C2 was designed by Larry Shinoda (Pete Brock was also instrumental on the C2) under the direction of GM chief stylist Bill Mitchell. They used crisp lines to accent everything from the big fenders, to the rear deck. The upgraded red paint has the right kind of gloss and shine that makes the sunshine-friendly droptop look terrific when you’re out cruising on a Sunday. Plus, on the days when you feel like having the top up, the black roof gives this a timeless color combo.</p>
<p>This classic time machine has all the correct details, like the two-piece chrome bumpers, ribbed rocker trim, and full badging. Even the way the headlights pop up tells you this is a quality classic.</p>

<p>If you like the way the roof looks against the red paint, then you’ll love the interior. That’s because this has been upgraded to black later in life, which means it’s crisp and dark. It has a great classic look on everything from the low-back bucket seats to the vertical Delco AM/FM radio that’s still cranking out tunes.</p>
<p>You get all the best driver’s features, like the grippy thin wood-rimmed steering wheel, a full set of gauges with large speedo and tach, and a bright stick shift calling out for your right hand from within the darkness.</p>

<p>Under the hood you see the bold orange valve covers and bright air topper that give this a correct-style look. This motor is harboring a secret. While the ’64 cars only had 327 cubic-inch V8s, this one has been upgraded to a 350 unit. Plus, it has other nice upgrades like a Holley four-barrel carburetor and MSD ignition. The motor fires up nicely and runs strong.</p>
<p>The four-speed manual transmission feeds a 4.11 Positraction rear end to give you complete control and proper quickness. And the fully independent suspension is exactly the kind of desirable setup that made the Sting Ray an early muscle car.</p>
