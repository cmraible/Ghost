If you want to see that interview, we’ve included it as well as the crash footage. He’s 77 and celebrated his birthday on the first day of the event. In the interview, he doesn’t want to say how much power his ride is making, but did disclose it’s “something north” of 2,500-horsepower. He also explained that being an all-wheel-drive car, it’s “pretty safe” even with all that power at high speeds. And while he did wreck out, he’s not wrong that with power going down to all four corners of the car there is greater stability. That doesn’t mean you can’t wreck out, obviously.",
