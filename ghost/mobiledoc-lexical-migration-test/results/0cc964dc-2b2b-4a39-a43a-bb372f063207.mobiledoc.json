After a terrible crash in Formula one the Venezuelan racer took an opportunity to race for BMW, he raced with them for many seasons and was even afforded the ability to race with DTM from 1988-1992. This partnership led to him finishing the 1990 racing season as runner-up in a BMW M30 M3 of his own. In 1989 BMW decided to go forth with the production of 505 Johnny Cecotto special edition E30 M3s making this one of BMWâ€™s rarest automobiles."

Other things he had to say about it were that it was the best sports car of its time and that it was the most successful touring car. After a long career of racing, Johnny Cecotto has certainly earned this special tribute and even got to show off some of his skill on the track in such a car for a feature with the BMW Group Classic YouTube channel."
