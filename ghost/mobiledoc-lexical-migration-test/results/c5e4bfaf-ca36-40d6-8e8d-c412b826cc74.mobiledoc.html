<p>In the age of the Internet, we are all daily posters — we post, we comment, we retweet, we email, we text, and sometimes we even reply all.</p>
<p>Being a daily poster is not a publishing schedule. It is an ethos, a way of life and a code. We live on the Internet, and when we have something to say, we post it online. That is our commitment to you.</p>
<h2 id="why-become-a-supporting-subscriber-to-the-daily-poster">Why become a supporting subscriber to The Daily Poster?</h2>
