Still all of the nostalgia was there, right down to the almost over the top graphics and the full old-school muscle car feeling interior. "

With a more aggressive camshaft, a 4 barrel carburetor, and ram header exhaust manifolds it is safe to say that it has exceeded its original 375-horsepower rating. Backing the power plant is a TH350 automatic transmission and a large aluminum radiator ensures the engine stays cool. "

A Vintage Air AC system, an Alpine radio complete with a tape deck, and a set of tastefully embroidered floor mats are a few of the more subtle differences. Outside, a slightly lowered stance and a set of 17-inch Snowflake wheels add a touch of aggression and a pinch of modernism that really allow the original style to shine. "
