<p>“I refuse to normalize an anti-democratic process where a few rich, predominantly white individuals negotiate behind closed doors for most of 2020 and give the rest of us a few hours to consider the 5,593 page result of their secret negotiations.” - incoming freshman <a href="https://twitter.com/CoriBush/status/1341225659293642755?s=20">Rep.

<p>Fewer than a third of voters want Pelosi to be reelected as speaker, while over 56 percent think she should be replaced, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/22/poll-people-want-pelosi-out-449788">a new poll from Politico and Morning Consult</a>. Unsurprisingly, Pelosi is much more popular among Democratic voters than Republican voters — but only about half of Democrats think she should remain speaker.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>DOJ SAYS U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN KILL ITS OWN CITIZENS: </strong>Last month, a Department of Justice lawyer <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/justice-department-asserts-unreviewable-discretion-to-kill-us-citizens/">argued</a> that the United States government has the power to kill its own citizens without oversight in certain cases, during a hearing on a lawsuit filed by an American journalist who alleges he was placed on the U.S. government’s “kill list.”</li>
    <li><strong>BIDEN APPOINTS AUSTERITY ADVOCATE: </strong>Weeks after progressives celebrated blocking austerity ideologue Bruce Reed from being named Biden’s budget director, Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/22/biden-announces-6-new-white-house-senior-staff-449807">selected Reed</a> for a top White House job anyway. Reed, <a href="https://prospect.org/blogs/tap/bidens-mr-austerity-bruce-reed/">who headed an Obama-era commission</a> to build support for Social Security cuts, will be Biden’s deputy chief of staff. Reed has also <a href="https://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4uKagy0oyMA/6Mr4AyZM0i0Z432cB0Gz3E">funneled millions of dollars</a> into Betsy DeVos’s organizations through his own education reform group.</li>
    <li><strong>GOOD/BAD ON DIVESTING PENSIONS: </strong>The bad news is that Trump’s Department of Labor <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/11/13/2020-24515/financial-factors-in-selecting-plan-investments">just finalized a rule</a> to make it harder for private sector employees to divest their pensions from certain industries, which we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-trump-rule-aims-to-protect-big/">wrote about</a> earlier this fall. The good news is that Democrats in Congress <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/federal-workers-are-forced-to-invest-in-fossil-fuels-a-new-bill-would-end-that/">have introduced two bills</a> that would make it possible for 5.5 million federal employees to divest their pensions from fossil fuels.</li>
    <li><strong>US v. TECH MONOPOLIES: </strong>Tech giants are going to extreme lengths to fight antitrust action. Facebook and Google <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-facebook-agreed-to-team-up-against-possible-antitrust-action-draft-lawsuit-says-11608612219">made a pact</a> to work together in the face of an investigation into their monopoly behavior, and Facebook even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/22/facebook-antitrust-lobbying-settlement/">offered to set up a competitor</a> to its own business as part of an attempted settlement agreement.</li>
