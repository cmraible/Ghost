With the theme of obtaining disposable humans to do battle at your bidding, progressing through dungeons feels very rewarding (and don't worry, the pangs of guilt from repeatedly sending humans to their doom don't last long). However, you can't forget about your humans' wellbeing entirely as the more you have at your disposal, the more food you need to have for them. Each human will consume one point of food when proceeding from one room to the next (even if you've already been to the room before) and if you run out, they'll fight with less enthusiasm and will probably die. Food costs tokens, so you can't just buy the best fighters and weapons willy-nilly, and it's this balance that provides a tonne of strategy to the game. However, you'll need to find that balance as spending too much on food results in less tokens for new units and upgrades, which can result in an embarrassing death with a mountain of food and no mouths to feed it to."
