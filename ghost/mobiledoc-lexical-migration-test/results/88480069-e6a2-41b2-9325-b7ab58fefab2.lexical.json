Aside from a dose of cynicism — the only incentive to move seems to be the fear of PR damage — , Facebook’s numbness is rooted in its insularity. Mark Zuckerberg has yet to understand that you don’t fight global misinformation from the shores of the San Francisco Bay. As demonstrated by a New York Times [investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/world/facebook-moderators-takeaways.html), Facebook is unable to think beyond its hyper-centralized system when it comes to fighting the junk that litters its pages"
