<p>What was originally planned to only include those who attended the Woodward Dream Cruise is now open to the public: Motorious 2019 Virtual Car Show, and it’s a cinch to enter now. Whether you were at Woodward or not, we’re opening the entries to anyone with a cool car they want to share - that means our entire audience is welcome to join the fun, and have a shot at some attractive prizes.</p>

<p>Now, there’s two levels of participation in the Motorious Virtual Car Show. The first, and simplest, way, is to take the best picture of your car and submit it through <a href="__GHOST_URL__/app" rel="noopener">www.motorious.com/app</a>. This requires no further action, and will qualify your car to compete to win in one of the classes. <br><br>If you want to participate to win Best In Show, there are a few simple steps, but you’ll get a shot at a big payoff for your efforts. To enter for the chance to win Best of Show in the Motorious Virtual Car Show, buy a Motorious windshield banner <a href="https://sam.motorious.com/virtual-carshow/"><strong>here</strong>.</a> Once applied, photograph your vehicle and submit it via the Motorious App link (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/app" rel="noopener">www.motorious.com/app</a>). Going this route, you’ll not only have a chance of winning Best in Class, you’ll have the exclusive opportunity to win Best in Show, a title only awarded to banner-sporting entries.</p>

<p>There are 6 classes for enthusiasts to participate in (Classic, Muscle, Off-road, Sports, Hotrod, and Tuner). After 1,000 submissions are reached, the winners of each class will be announced (each winner receives a professional car detailing pail), along with the Best In Show winner, who will receive a $1,000 cash prize.<br><br>We are only allowing 1,000 cars to enter (so participants have a 1 in 1,000, or better if not everyone submits using a banner, chance of winning Best In Show). As stated above, only the participants who have purchased and applied their Motorious banner for the photos submitted will have a shot at the $1,000 grand prize.<br><br>The winner of the grand prize for Best Of Show will be picked by the racing legend himself, Richard Petty. Once chosen, the Motorious team will announce the lucky winner and crown them Best In Show of the 2019 Motorious Virtual Car Show - best of luck to all who enter!</p>
