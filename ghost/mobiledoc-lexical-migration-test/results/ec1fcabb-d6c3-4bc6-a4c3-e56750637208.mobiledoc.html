<p>On Thursday 10/21 at 6pm ET (3 pm PT), David Sirota, Julia Rock, and <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will speak with <em>The American Prospect’s </em>David Dayen and <em>The Intercept</em>’s Ryan Grim about the rapidly shifting battle to pass a Democratic agenda bill that retains vital tax, climate, and social-safety-net provisions. Over the past few days alone, progressives <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/577493-progressives-see-budget-deal-getting-close-after-biden-meeting">notched a key meeting</a> with President Joe Biden, while corporate Sen. Joe Manchin, W.Va., has reportedly <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/senator-joe-manchin-democratic-party-exit-plan-biden-infrastructure-deal-exclusive/">threatened</a> to leave the Democratic Party if he doesn’t get his way — so where does the fight go next?</p>
<p>Dayen is the award-winning executive editor of <em>The American Prospect</em> and author of <em>Monopolized: Life in the Age of Corporate Power</em> and<em> Chain of Title: How Three Ordinary Americans Uncovered Wall Street’s Great Foreclosure Fraud</em>. Grim is <em>The Intercept</em>’s D.C. bureau chief, and he previously led <em>HuffPost</em>’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington bureau and authored the book <em>We’ve Got People: From Jesse Jackson to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement</em>. </p>
<p>Sirota, Rock, Dayen, and Grim will discuss the state of the reconciliation battle, whether progressives have enough leverage to hold steady on their demands, why corporate media is missing the real stakes of the political fight, and how Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin are just the latest examples of the long line of rotating villains who have worked to sink the Democratic party’s agenda on the behalf of their corporate masters.</p>
