Essentially, the team got a hold of a trailer, truck, and a forklift to load all the stuff in together.

On top of the mower, they also took a myriad of different tools, likely to add them on their quest for what was to come.",

In total, this car would have been worth around $300,000, in Australian currency, Making it quite a profitable heist for all thieves involved. Overall, The crime presented was a bit of a convoluted plot but shouldn’t be too difficult of a case to crack considering all the different factors involved. The first place police might want to start looking would be where they got the forklift from and move on from there.",
