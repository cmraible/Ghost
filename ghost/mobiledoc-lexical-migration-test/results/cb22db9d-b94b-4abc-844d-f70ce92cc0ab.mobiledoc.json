While it’s bad enough when a regular dealer gets cleaned out by a crew of thieves, it’s even worse when someone hits a classic car dealer. To do one more than that, police say 28-year-old Nathan Ryan Wasson crashed a stolen utility truck through the storefront of a classic car dealership in Pleasant View, Tennessee in the wee morning hours of November 2."

He finally chose a convertible Camaro, which he rammed through the front doors and damaged. Instead of taking that Camaro, he selected a second one and fled the scene with police hot on his tail."

On top of that, to fix the storefront, which includes the doors, he’s looking at another $30,000.  He also remarked that the unsophisticated robbery didn’t seem to have been planned out but instead that Wasson likely just saw an opportunity in the moment."
