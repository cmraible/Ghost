That’s exactly what we have here with this 1994 JDM Toyota Land Cruiser being offered by Driver Motorsports. Imported from Japan, it’s completely legal with all necessary documentation and has a right-hand-drive configuration that’s extra fun to take in drive-throughs."

A 4-inch lift kit helps give those massive tires clearance and keeps the transfer cases clear of obstacles. Other modifications like Emu shocks optimize this ride for hardcore trail use."

There’s an ice maker in the center console, so you’re not suffering with warm drinks or the inability to keep fresh-caught fish fresh while you’re adventuring. Just add a roof-top tent and a few other goodies to make this rig the ultimate setup for overlanding."
