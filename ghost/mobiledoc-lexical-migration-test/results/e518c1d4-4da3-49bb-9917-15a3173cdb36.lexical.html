<hr>
<p>When Dodge introduced its third-generation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-dodge-challenger-commemorative-edition/">Challenger</a>, U.S. production for the initial 2008 model year was limited to just 6,400 units. Between the classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> design and the low volume, these <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/199923/2008-dodge-challenger-srt8">2008 Dodge Challenger SRT8 First Edition</a> cars were instant collector cars, and this one up for grabs through <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gaa-classic-cars-physical-auction-july/">GAA Classic Car Auctions</a> is a one-owner, low-mileage example.</p>

<p>Out of the 6,400 First Edition Challengers built, this one is no. 3054, and it survives today with 11,000 actual miles. Even better, it has had just one owner since new, and it was sold and serviced by the same dealership over the years. Options were limited on these early Challengers, but this had the automatic transmission and optional sunroof as well as the Hemi Orange paint job. The only other colors available in 2008 were Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, and the dual snorkel hood and carbon fiber stripes racing stripes were standard.</p>
<p>The Limited Edition was only available as the SRT8 model, which means that all of these cars are powered by Dodge's 6.1-liter Hemi V8 laying down 425 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. This output allowed the 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT8 to back up its muscle car looks with impressive performance that included a 0-60 mph time in the low five second range as well as a quarter-mile time of under 14 seconds.</p>
<p>Thanks to numerous performance innovations, the Dodge Challenger is a popular option among enthusiasts, and this 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT8 First Edition will make for the perfect addition to any collection. It will be up for grabs on Friday, July 24th at the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/inventory/dealer/GAA+Classic+Car+Auctions">GAA Classic Car Auctions</a>, so be sure you're <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/199923/2008-dodge-challenger-srt8">registered to bid</a>.</p>
