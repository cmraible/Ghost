That didn’t keep a British YouTuber from taking one for a spin around the Nurburgring Nordschleife, the infamous track in Germany everyone seems to think is the only true test of a performance vehicle. It’s an interesting thing to do, considering the Green Hell is often dominated by European performance cars, not full-size American pickup trucks."

          "“This thing is huge,” says the Brit as he first pulls away in the TRX. For those of us who have driven much larger trucks, be it for work or otherwise, a full-size pickup truck just doesn’t feel all that big or unmanageable. The fact this guy is already freaked out by the pickup’s size as he’s in a parking lot with tons of space tells us he’s probably going to do more than just hit the rumble strips."

The guy is comparing them to the brakes on an Audi SQ7, which of course are huge and feature multiple times more pistons. Is this foreshadowing to how disastrous this run will be?"

The factory tires are 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler Territory all-terrains, so they’re not exactly designed to hold to a wet blacktop. The wrong tire selection for conditions can absolutely make or break a run, so it’s too bad they couldn’t have swapped these for a more street-friendly selection beforehand."

Well, they would be shocked to see just how big trucks can get, because nobody in North America would call it such a thing. Sure, it’s a “monster” when it comes to performance, but “monster trucks” generally have 66-inch tires. Maybe we should ship a few of those over the pond and see how many people literally die of shock."

Or maybe he’s just being a drama queen for the camera as he exclaims how big the TRX is. Whichever it is, the video is still interesting to watch, even if you just skip to where he’s on the track (warning: language)."
