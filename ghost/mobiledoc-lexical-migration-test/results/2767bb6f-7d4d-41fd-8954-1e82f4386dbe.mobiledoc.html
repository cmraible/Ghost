<p>David and Adam took questions from the audience about ¬†living through the past year of U.S. politics, which at times has felt eerily similar to the Oscar-nominated disaster movie they co-wrote, <em>Don‚Äôt Look Up</em>:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ How did the two take all the pushback they recently received for criticizing the Inflation Reduction Act?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ What do they think of the BBC news clip which went viral for echoing their movie?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ What do they believe the role of modern satire should be?</p>
