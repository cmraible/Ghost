<hr>
<p>While the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office was using <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/divers-40-cars-tennessee/">dive teams</a> to search for a Florida man who’s been missing, it instead found some cars at the bottom of a lake. Authorities believe the vehicles, which were recovered somewhere in Seminole, had been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/indiana-authorities-car-grave/">sitting underwater</a> for over 40 years. As you can see from the photos they’re pretty much disintegrated messes at this point, but we’re sure someone will say they should be restored and not scrapped.</p>

<p>At this point we’re wondering what bodies of water don’t have cars sitting at the bottom. We’ve covered this phenomena more times than we might be able to count at this point, it’s become so common. Lest you think this is purely an American phenomenon, cars have been found in lakes, rivers, etc. in other countries, so it really isn’t.</p>

<p>Why these vehicles are just now being found we believe is thanks to modern technology. Average fishermen are using sonar to figure out where to cast their lines as well as navigate waterways, with the devices providing ever-clearer pictures of what might be submerged in murky water. Divers have cameras and other equipment which do a better job of penetrating the muck which in the past has done a great job of hiding vehicles sitting underwater.</p>
<p>Another factor is that what once was out in the country is now part of the city or at least the suburbs. People dumped cars “in the middle of nowhere” years ago but now there are houses, shopping centers, and plenty of people around. That invites discovery.</p>

<p>According to the sheriff’s department, what you see in the photos is a 1960s Dodge Coronet and a 1950s Volkswagen Beetle. We assume they ran the VINs.</p>
