Just like a retail store increasing prices to adjust for increased theft, dealerships are likely considering the same. More and more cars are being stolen straight from dealerships, and then used inventory is even lower when people steal cars that are unable to be traded in. Obviously, it's not the core issue with scarcity and astronomical prices, but it does tick you off even more so when some entitled criminal thinks they get the car you've been shopping to purchase."

However, none are as riveting and horrifying as the story of John Paul Sr. This guy was infamous within the racing community for his unlawful drug trafficking services and later became the most wanted man in racing history after being implicated in the disappearances of several people. Without a doubt, this man was out for blood against anyone who got in his way, but many don't fully understand the story behind these missing persons."
