The heads have been swapped out for TA heads and the rest of the modifications total up to an incredible 1000 horsepower at the crank and 900 wheel horsepower. Despite the crazy engine under the hood the car is built to dominate the street rather than the strip. Seeing as how the car itself is extremely low mileage, the interior was left mostly stock. The beautiful drag-type wheels are wrapped with a set of drag radials.",
