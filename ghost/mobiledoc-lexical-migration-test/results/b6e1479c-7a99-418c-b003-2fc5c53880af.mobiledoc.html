<hr>
<p>Ford rolled out <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/878/1992-ford-bronco-nite-edition">the Bronco</a> as their very first SUV in the lineup, which is wild to think about now after they’ve put their badge on so many models in this segment. It spanned over 5 generations, before taking a long hiatus and making a major comeback. Made to compete against Jeep and the International Harvester, the Ford Bronco was a winning formula, and by the time fifth generation rolled around, the Ford Bronco was in high demand. Examples like this <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/878/1992-ford-bronco-nite-edition">1992 Ford Bronco</a> with 4x4 Nite Edition represent the generation well, and will be the highlight of your vintage SUV collection.</p>
