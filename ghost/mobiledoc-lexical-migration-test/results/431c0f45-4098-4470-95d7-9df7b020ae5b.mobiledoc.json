Those rings often have their hands in other crimes, including shoplifting and drugs. It’s up to lawmakers, law enforcement, and others involved in the capture and prosecution of members of these theft rings to do what’s necessary to actually break them. We doubt operations like Project R&R do more than just put a dent in these organizations, but it’s still important to celebrate even the smallest of victories while keeping the bigger picture in perspective."
