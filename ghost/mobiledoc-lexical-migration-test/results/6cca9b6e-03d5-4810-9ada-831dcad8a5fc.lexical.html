<hr>
<p>When it comes to their sports cars and muscle cars, the big three have been using the basic formula followed by some of the world’s <a href="https://resurrectionlongwood.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingrayz51?promo=M1">fastest exotics and supercars</a> for decades now. Everyone knows that speed and agility comes down to two basic principles- weight and power. For that reason, squeezing the largest, most powerful engine under the hood of the lightest car in the lineup became a staple in the 1950’s. In a race to 200-mph, automakers finally started paying more attention to aerodynamics by the 1970’s. When displacement alone wasn’t enough, just like the majority of supercars and exotics, American auto manufacturers moved towards forced induction. As the exotic sports car scene started to move towards a better weight distribution with a seemingly industry standard mid-engine layout, with a few exceptions Ford, Dodge, and <a href="https://resurrectionlongwood.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingrayz51?promo=M1">Chevy managed</a> to steer clear of the idea for their production cars.</p>

<p>In a gigantic leap towards closing the gap between all-American sports car and exotic race-inspired supercar, Chevrolet made the <a href="https://resurrectionlongwood.tapkat.org/wina2020corvettestingrayz51?promo=M1">2020 Corvette Stingray</a>. The first ever production Corvette to feature a mid-engine design. A decision that is almost solely responsible for making the 2020 Corvette the fastest, most agile base model Corvette ever made.</p>
