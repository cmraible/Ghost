Funded by the car companies themselves, the teams often had nearly no limit beyond their own creativity even being given the chance to roll the dice with a few hemi V8‘s. One vehicle that will forever be heralded within the sub genre of car culture as one of the most iconic competitors in the game is the Plymouth barracuda. Recently, two stunning examples of that automobile went head to head in a race between their respective impressive teams.",

They say most drag races are one within the first 60 feet of the track. If that is to be believed then it seemed that Honkin Hemi was likely the vector of this battle. However the camera ended up cutting off before it showed the exact quarter-mile times so the only ones who know who really won are the people who are there. Unless any more information comes out about the race we’re just gonna have to speculate but either way both cars had a great run, sounded amazing, and put on a show. That’s what really matters.",
