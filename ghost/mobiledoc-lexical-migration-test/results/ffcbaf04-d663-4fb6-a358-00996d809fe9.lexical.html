<hr>
<p>If you’re like us, whenever you drive through rural areas you notice old cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-field-is-full-of-old-porsches/">sitting in fields</a> or by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-most-dramatic-barn-finds/">barns</a>. Art Stevens must be the same way, because in 2015 the guy zeroed in on a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjE5NDEiLCJjaGV2cm9sZXQiXX0=">1941 Chevrolet Special Deluxe</a> parked in a field with a “for sale” sign in the window. Stevens was driving his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mercedes-lowrider-truck/">semi-truck</a> at the time, but he still pulled over to inquire about the car to which he felt a deep sentimental attachment.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out a field full of classic Porsches <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-field-is-full-of-old-porsches/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>You see, Stevens had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/learn-to-drive-a-ford-model-t/">learned to drive</a> in his dad’s 1941 Chevy, which was just like the car advertised for sale. However, the owner wanted more than Stevens was willing to pay. Over the course of a year, the truck driver would stop and talk to the vehicle owner whenever he was in the area. Finally, they agreed to a selling price and Stevens was able to relive many fond memories.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for the man to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/abandoned-c3-corvette/">get the Chevy running</a>. A mere 15 minutes after getting it off the trailer, he had the six-cylinder engine humming, proving the durability of the design. From there, two of the man’s sons along with a lifelong friend of his worked to restore the classic car. This is the thing so many non-gearheads don’t understand. They think people who love cars hate people, that they brood alone in their garage. Maybe they knew someone like that, but such a person is more of the exception than the rule. Working with friends and family on getting an old classic in good shape is a tremendous bonding experience. It also teaches patience, attention to detail, self-reliance, and dedication to a long-term goal.</p>
<p>Now the ’41 Chevy looks fantastic and runs great. However, Stevens does admit it has a Ford rear. That’s ok, plenty of classic Fords have a Chevy crate engine. We love seeing stories like these in the news, because it helps portray the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mans-dying-wish/">human side of car collecting</a>, especially when it’s just everyday people enjoying each other’s company.</p>
