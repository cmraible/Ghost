Whether you think that was the right call or not, we’re reaping all the rewards of those policies, like pretty much everything costing significantly more. That brings us to this admittedly sad looking 1970 Pontiac Trans Am we recently ran across on eBay."

However, with a price of $5,500 someone who isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty could really make something out of what’s left of this Trans Am. The thing is a lot of people just want to buy pretty cars these days. They don’t like building things and so they pay through the nose."

Some say estimate how much the project will cost you, doing so liberally, then add another 30 percent to the cost and that’s probably accurate. Hey, if you’re only dropping $5,500 on the beginnings of your build, that could leave you with plenty more to play with."
