<p>Originally, 1967 was supposed to be the first year for the C3 Corvette, but Zora Arkus-Duntov needed to spend more time in the wind tunnel getting the new car's shape just right. As a result, the 1967 Corvette would be a continuation of the C2.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't a mere carryover of the 1966. The 1967 Corvette has a few visual differences that set it apart from the previous model year. The side gills were now five segments instead of three. In addition, the rocker panel trim was now smooth instead of ribbed.</p>
<p>Overall, though, the 1967 Corvette was the same shape that we all know and love. We found this one on Facebook Marketplace in Whitehall, Montana, situated between Butte and Bozeman.</p>

<p>It's an Ermine White 327/300HP car, with a four speed manual transmission and a 3.36 Positraction rear end. Surprisingly, Ermine White was a relatively unpopular color in 1967, with just 1,423 Corvettes leaving the St. Louis assembly plant painted that color.</p>
<p>By comparison, the most popular 1967 color, Goodwood Green, accounted for 4,293 cars. In total, 22,940 Corvettes would be sold in 1967. It's hard to imagine a time when a dark, rich shade of green was the most popular color, while black, white, and silver were among the least popular. We miss the good old days.</p>

<p>The drivetrain is said to be original and numbers matching, and the car has just 97,000 miles. The seller is asking $50,000. That's a decent chunk of change for a car with the base engine, but considering the car's originality, rare color, and overall condition, it's not too far off the mark.</p>
