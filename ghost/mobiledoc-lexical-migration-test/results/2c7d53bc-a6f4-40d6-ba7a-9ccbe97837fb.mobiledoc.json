If you’ve ever seen pictures of the famous criminal couple, you’d know they looked nothing like the romanticized Hollywood depictions. They also didn’t die glamorously. It’s the same story with this couple who ran from Arkansas State Police in a Dodge Charger at speeds well over 100 mph on a little two-lane highway."

We’ve seen them run down far superior vehicles through their excellent driving skills. Plus, most people who run from the cops aren’t nearly as good at driving as they think."

A guy in a Mustang passes him on the left, then the trooper suddenly pulls behind him. We can only imagine what was going on in the Mustang driver’s head for that split second until the trooper flipped a U and went the opposite way."
