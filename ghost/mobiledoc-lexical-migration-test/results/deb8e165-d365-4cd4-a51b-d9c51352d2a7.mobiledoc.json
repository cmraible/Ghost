This particular 1966 Pontiac from Carlisle's Lakeland Winter Collection is a rare 2+2 that proves that the Bonneville was hardly an inferior cousin in the B-Body lineup from GM."

Many of the older cars are in various states of disarray upon discovery. The car enthusiast's job is to restore and maintain the vehicle's legacy through their hard work. Many people have differing opinions on whether a classic should be modified past its original design, but the truth is that the insane muscle cars of the 1960s and 1970s were meant for one thing, performance. In recent years, the sudden realization of this fact has sprouted a movement of restomodders and power-hungry classic car enthusiasts ready to compete with some of the craziest cars from the modern muscle car era. Of course, this particular car is the perfect example to show you just how amazing one of these projects can be, and the best part is that you could soon own it!"

The sight of the vintage Orange paint scraping up against trees, dirt, and tall grass as the Duke brothers ran from the cops is one that brought a smile to everyone’s face in the 1970s. However, most of the cars were demolished during the shooting of the show, which means that anyone with the dream of owning a General Lee of their own would be out of luck. Luckily we have a few particular automotive enthusiasts in the classic car community who are willing to put in the work to recreate one of those classic beasts. This car is a perfect example of that dedication!"

The sound pouring out of the exhaust pipes of the McLaren racing vehicles is purely musical as it has been designed for function, which has led to an intense form.

So how are those car enthusiasts, with a little extra cash to spare, supposed to find one of these incredible masterpieces of automotive innovation?"

These tiny vehicles boasted potent yet small, four-cylinder engines whose reputation for speed made the cars the perfect choice for any hot-blooded driver ready for some action. But, of course, to drive one of these cars, you had to be prepared for the ride of your lifetime, and that came in the form of a short wheelbase, lightweight body, and your choice of coupe or roadster body types. This particular vehicle was an iconic car for its day because of the sleek Porsche style that still stands out to this day. So what car is so incredible that it deserves the title of the best Porsche representative from the mid-1960s?"
