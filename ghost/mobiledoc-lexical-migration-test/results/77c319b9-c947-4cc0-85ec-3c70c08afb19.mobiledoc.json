People were pretty upset about this change, but sadly we think a lot of drivers these days are scared of managing a third pedal since that makes recording your TikTok while cruising down the road more difficult. And we wish that were completely a joke."

We recommend it not only because a stick almost always makes the driving experience more engaging and entertaining, but a stick shift will help keep your kitty safe from all the thieves looking to steal Mopar muscle cars."
