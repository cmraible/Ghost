Not everyone got the memo because for whatever reason we keep seeing stories of guys going over double the posted speed limit on different highway stretches. This time it was a C8 Corvette hitting 161 mph in a 70 mph zone. It didn’t end well for the driver."

After he called the vehicle in, a Be On The Lookout (BOLO) was announced to all local law enforcement."
