Whether you enjoy the company of some American muscle or JDM diamonds, it goes without saying that we would all be distraught, to say the least. We all love our cars and while we don't have information into what modifications were done to the car, it doesn't make the effort invalid. The wicked white Vette was a member of the C4 club, these slept on performance cars that had about 300-horsepower being made by a 5.7-liter V8 LT engine connected to a 6-speed transmission. Regardless of the performance, this dedicated car enthusiast has just lost one of his prized vehicles and we hope that he finds some better luck in the future."
