<p>Why people leave legendary <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/american-muscle">muscle cars</a> sitting to rust is inconceivable. After all, you’d just have to pick up the phone or even post something on social media to have potential buyers tripping over each other to pay good money for such a vehicle. That’s what makes finds like this 1970 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford/Mustang%20Mach%20I?filter=eyJtb2RlbHMiOlsiTXVzdGFuZyBNYWNoIDEgRmFzdGJhY2siXX0=">Ford Mustang Mach 1</a> sitting in a field in Texas so interesting and simultaneously horrific. Look at the poor car!</p>
<p>This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford">Ford</a> was originally discovered by Dennis Collins of Fast ‘N Loud fame. He ran over to the property once he found out about it, before anyone could beat him to the punch. Thankfully Collins has a YouTube channel and decided to monetize this adventure further by documenting the process, which you can see below.</p>
<p>Actually, the story behind this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIm11c3RhbmciXX0=">Mustang</a> is pretty sad. The previous owner had it in storage since 1983, so likely he cared for it. Well, he died and whomever inherited the car had it hauled to a family farm where it sat outside for a year. Nothing says unappreciative quite like that. So maybe it was a good thing this Ford was rescued and can now live a better life.</p>
<p>Even though the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/382579/ford-mustang-crossover">Ford Mustang Mach 1</a> has been in the same family for 42 years and is quite the valuable car, it looks pretty worse for wear. It’s amazing what a single year of exposure to the elements can do. The tarp which was covering the Ford has been destroyed, paint is chipping, etc. It’s no small wonder the owner, possibly the son, doesn’t want to show his face on camera.</p>
<p>Another thing about this video: it’s obvious Collins and his crew have been involved in some difficult recoveries in the past. They show up with a Jeep Wrangler with a winch and a heavy-duty Ram pickup to pull this Mustang Mach 1 out of the field and onto the trailer. Just like with any job, the right tools make it relatively easy.</p>

<p>While this is a nice, original car, there’s one major thing missing: the engine. That’s sadly not surprising but still disappointing. It’s still a solid find for Collins and hopefully will end up in the right hands after he sells it.</p>
