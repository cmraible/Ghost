For Afghanistan’s population of about thirty-eight million, the defeat has been incomparably more consequential. The Taliban are reimposing strict Sharia law on the country, which has lost billions of dollars in foreign aid, and the nation is now gripped by a spreading famine. The debates and decisions in Washington, Kabul, and Doha that preceded the Islamic Republic’s fall took place largely in private. Hundreds of pages of meeting notes, transcripts, memoranda, e-mails, and documents, as well as extensive interviews with Afghan and American officials, present a dispiriting record of misjudgment, hubris, and delusion from the very start.”"

Stockton described these discussions as largely logistical and focused on planning the members’ participation in objections to the electoral certification on the House floor and various events that were staged to protest against the election. They include Instagram messages Lawrence exchanged with Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) as she tried to get him to speak at the Ellipse rally. Cawthorn, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, ultimately appeared onstage at that event. ‘We’re turning it all over and we’ll let the cards fall where they may,’ Stockton says.”"

            "— “The drivers’ victory was a testament to the unifying power of collective labor action. Ninety-four percent of cab drivers are immigrants, and 95 percent are men, but there are few other commonalities among them. Cabbies represent almost every race, religion, and country of origin, and they speak over 120 languages. They spend their days isolated in their cabs, competing for a dwindling number of fares. Yet for decades, NYTWA—a 21,000-member union of cab, livery, and rideshare drivers—had brought them together around their common plight. Now, through relentless work, shrewd organizing, and ferocious solidarity, cabbies had moved the city. This is the story of how they did it.”"

BlackRock and other investment salesmen use these ESG ratings, as they’re called, to justify a “sustainable” label on stock and bond funds. For a significant number of investors, it’s a powerful attraction. Yet there’s virtually no connection between MSCI’s ‘better world’ marketing and its methodology. That’s because the ratings don’t measure a company’s impact on the Earth and society. In fact, they gauge the opposite: the potential impact of the world on the company and its shareholders. MSCI doesn’t dispute this characterization. It defends its methodology as the most financially relevant for the companies it rates.”"

            "story published Thursday noted that the ads are part of a larger ad blitz against the bill and that the Manchin spot features West Virginia residents who were vetted by the Chamber. But it appears that two of the four people may have another reason to oppose Biden's plan: They work for fossil fuel companies. ‘Maribeth’ appears to be Maribeth Anderson, who heads government relations for Antero Resources and once headed the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association. Antero describes itself as an ‘independent oil and natural gas company’ and operates both in Colorado and in West Virginia. ‘Mackenzie’ appears to be MacKenzie Morley, marketing director for CJ Hughes. According to its website, CJ Hughes was founded as a ‘drilling contractor for the gas and petroleum industries’ and now does construction for the ‘water, sanitary, natural gas and petroleum industries.’”"

So, if we can work out how to improve photosynthesis, we can boost yields. We won’t have to go on destroying yet more land for crops — we can try to produce more on the land we’re already using.’”"
