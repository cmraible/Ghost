<hr>
<p>Little red Corvettes, big black Cadillacs, and Hugger Orange Chevys are some of the most thought about paint jobs when it comes to vintage cars. That's why when we see a few stunning blue, especially light blue, classics in one place, it tends to catch our attention a little more. These three blue American vehicles respresent three distinct hobby collector car segments, and we can't decide which we like more - which one would you  choose? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.gregsclassicauto.com/vehicles/41/1956-chevrolet-bel-air-hardtop">Tri-Five Chevies</a> are among the most desirable American cars ever. Somehow, the ‘55s and the ‘57s get all the love, but this ‘56 Chevy deserves your attention. This Tropical Turquoise Bel Air is powered by a 265 Small Block Chevy V8, with power sent through a three-speed manual transmission that’s shifted on the column. It  benefited from a frame-off restoration a mere 280 miles ago.</p>
