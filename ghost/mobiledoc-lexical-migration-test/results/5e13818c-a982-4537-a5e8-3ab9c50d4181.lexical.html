<p>Cadillac fans have a new place to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pontiac-museum-could-open/">make their pilgrimage</a>, The Greenberg <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/betty-whites-parakeet-cadillac/">Cadillac</a> Museum, which contains the largest private collection of Cadillacs in the United States. Located in Brookville, Pennsylvania, it contains over 70 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/two-guys-start-1941-cadillac/">fully-restored Cadillacs</a> stretching virtually the entire history of the brand, with the oldest car in the collection being a 1905. This allows visitors to get a sense for how America’s premiere luxury automaker <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cadillac-xlr-turnaround-sports-car/">has evolved over the years</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn how the XLR helped turn Cadillac around <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cadillac-xlr-turnaround-sports-car/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Previously, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-wagon-hits-200-mph/">collection of Cadillacs</a> wasn’t open to the public. However, this June 17-20 it will be opening up to everyone for the first time ever. The Jefferson County Historical Society and Brookville Laurel Festival have worked to help make this unique opportunity a reality.</p>

<p>Spanning 9,000 square feet with 9 galleries and 12 exhibit areas, plus a research library, gift shop, and staff offices, The Greenburg Cadillac Museum should be a favorite destination for many fans. The fee of admission is a donation which goes toward the Jefferson County Historical Society.</p>
<p>Back in 1973, Dr. Steven Greenburg, who was a young eye surgeon at the time, moved from Detroit to Brookville with his cherished 1966 Cadillac. Throughout the years, the man added many more cars to his rapidly-expanding collection. After the man retired he really got busy with restoring the classic cars.</p>
