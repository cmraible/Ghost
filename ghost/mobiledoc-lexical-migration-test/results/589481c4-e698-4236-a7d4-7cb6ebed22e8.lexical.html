<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-cancelled/">SEMA may be a scratched</a> for this year, but if you don't feel like cancelling your trip, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic car</a> lovers just got another reason to love Las Vegas. Whether you've always wanted to drive a legitimate <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">JDM</a>-spec import or you just want to cruise the strip in a flashy car that isn't a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/">Ferrari </a>or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/five-things-lamborghini-miura/">Lamborghini</a>, a new company located just off the strip, called Rent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/widebody-ford-ranger-jdm/">JDM</a>, could have just what you want. </p>

<p>As its name suggests, Rent JDM will rent you a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/8-coolest-jdm/">JDM</a>-spec car, and your options will be vast. Obviously, there are popular cars such as the 1999 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/wrangle-godzilla-with-this-2001-nissan-skyline-gt-r/">Nissan Skyline GT-R</a> and 1993 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1994-mitsubishi-lancer-evolution-ii-gsr-lets-you-live-your-wrc-dreams/">Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution II</a>, but perhaps the coolest car in their fleet is a 1993 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/castrol-toms-toyota-supra-racecar-restoration/">Toyota Supra</a> painted up to look like the hero car from 2001's <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>. If sports cars aren't quite your speed, there are some of the more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/obscure-jdm-cars/">obscure JDM cars</a> like the 1993 Suzuki Cappuccino and 1990 Nissan Pulsar and 1991 Nissan Figaro.</p>
<p>For now, it looks like Rent JDM isn't quite yet ready to rent out cars, so you'll want to give them a call before getting your hopes up. The good news is that even if you can't rent one of these JDM legends, the collection is currently open for tours. In the safety video, Rent JDM wants to make sure its customers don't try to get too fast or too furious, and while pricing hasn't been announced, the rentals do include gas and roadside assistance.</p>
