<h3 id="and-it%E2%80%99s-a-great-example-of-the-first-generation-f-bodies">And it’s a great example of the first generation F-Bodies!</h3>
<p>The first generation of the Pontiac Firebird represented when GM threw its hat into the Pony Car game with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dead-chevy-camaro/">Chevy Camaro</a> and Firebirds on the now famous F-Body platform. By the time 1969 rolled around, the first generation of the F-Bodies was wrapping up, and GM was gearing up to give both cars a pretty major overhaul, the cars were exiting their first one with a bang - as seen in this example of a stunning <a href="https://www.triplefautomotive.com/inventory/213/1969-pontiac-firebird?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1969 Pontiac Firebird</a>.</p>

<p>You know a car is well loved when it stays in the same family for almost five decades. This beautiful ‘Bird was treated to an ultra deluxe, no expense spared, rotisserie restoration to bring it back to ‘as new’ condition. The restoration totaled over $114,000 in parts and labor, and was completed in 2010.</p>

<p>With a 350 cubic inch, backed by a three-speed manual, this is definitely a ‘driver’s car’, and its one of the best condition first-gen Firebirds around for sale right, especially considering the price tag. The 2-door hardtops had a relatively low production number with around only 74,000 made and an unknown amount still even in existence.</p>
<p>The restoration of this Firebird is very well documented, and the family heirloom needs nothing except a new home.
