Suddenly, your current job probably doesn’t sound all that bad. Pretty much everyone agrees the Mustang II was the worst pony to shamble out of the stable. But if your job is to make people want to buy one despite it being a complete dog, you start pulling out all the things you can from your bag of tricks."

That literally sets a fun tone, going perfectly with all the lifestyle shots of men and women at play, which look like they could’ve been lifted out of any beer ad."

It’s a pretty ridiculous claim being made implicitly, but the ad agency did its best to sell it. They even put in the part of about “how does it feel to be a hero?” Probably nothing like driving a second-gen Mustang, that’s for sure."

Maybe someone back in 1975 was fooled into thinking they were getting a product that was superior to a ’69 or ’70 Mustang, but time has not been kind to these cars at all."
