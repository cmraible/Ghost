<p>For those who missed their chance to buy a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-dodge-challenger-drag-pak">2021 Dodge Challenger Drag Pak</a> or perhaps wanted something that is street legal, this video proves that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</a> is still an epic choice when it comes to a factory <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-dodge-demon-drag-race/">drag racer</a>. Watch as one of these rare Demons heads the quarter-mile where it flexes its 840-horspower Hellcat Hemi against some classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-six-figure-muscle-car-would-you-buy/">muscle car</a> icons.</p>

<p>Even with the delayed reaction time on a few runs, the Demon's supercharged Hellcat V8 manages to outmuscle most of the cars it goes up against. Perhaps the coolest run to watch is against a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1971-chevrolet-chevelle/">'71 Chevelle</a> SS where the Demon lifts the front wheels off the ground from the launch. Equally impressive is watching this new-school Dodge Challenger go up against some old-school Mopars including <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-dodge-charger/">1968 Dodge Charger</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-plymouth-barracuda/">1970 Hemi 'Cuda</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1972-dodge-challenger/">1972 Dodge Challenger</a>.</p>
<p>The Dodge Challenger SRT Demon was only offered for the 2018 model year, and only 3,300 Demons were built (3,000 for the U.S. and 300 for Canada). With a curb weight of 4,280 pounds, the Demon is probably heavier than most cars it will line up against, but the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 makes up for any weight issues with up to 840 horsepower (on racing fuel) and 770 lb-ft of torque.</p>
<p>At the time it was released, the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon had the fastest 0-60 acceleration time of a production car at just 2.3 seconds, and Dodge states this car could run the quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds at 140 mph. In this video, the driver gets pretty close to that number with a best time of 9.83 seconds at 136.19 mph and plenty of runs in the low 10-seconds. Not bad for a factory-fresh, turn-key street car with a warranty!</p>
