<p>Good things are happening! The proposal of a new constitution in Chile leaves behind the Pinochet era, enshrining the rights of workers and the environment. Also, California is tired of dangerous prices for insulin and will invest in producing its own low-cost options. Californians will also receive inflation-relief checks, and congressional staffers are organizing to demand climate action from Democratic leadership. Many of the staffers have been working on key climate policy for years, and they are now escalating their organizing commitments to go after stalling leadership. </p><!--members-only-->

<p>In Chile, a democratically elected convention proposed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/164mMOeJjMZASucSPVOMuM8WhvlUV74QO/view">new constitution</a> that centers on environmental justice, gender equality, and <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/07/chile-constitutional-convention-neoliberalism-pinochet-labor">worker empowerment</a>. The document attempts to recognize Indigeneous autonomy and <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/07/chile-constitutional-convention-neoliberalism-pinochet-labor">guarantees access</a> to health care, abortion, housing, education, and pensions. This <a href="https://twitter.com/saaaauuull/status/1546537634503221250">Twitter thread</a> by a Green New Deal organizer with Rep. Cori Bush’s (D-Mo.) office translates and highlights what the constitution could mean for confronting climate change. The proposal emerges as a result of mass protests that started in <a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/12/gabriel-boric-kast-presidential-election-pinochet-neoliberalism">2019</a> against austerity and the Pinochet era.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://archive.ph/Dygwd#selection-597.0-601.44"><em>Economist</em></a><em><a href="https://archive.ph/uQSQ3#selection-597.0-597.70">articles</a></em> have attempted to discredit the new constitution. But as media critic Adam Johnson <a href="https://thecolumn.substack.com/p/the-economist-magazine-which-helped">noted</a> in response to these stories, “In defending the 1980 Pinochet-era constitution, <em>The Economist</em>, however, probably ought to note how much the magazine played an active role in not only overthrowing Chilean democracy 50 years ago, but how much it propped up and defended the subsequent dictatorship known for right-wing death squads and mass killings.”</p>
<p>The proposed new constitution is an exciting step that exemplifies what mass action can do to demand fundamental rights. It will be voted on in a mandatory referendum on September 4th.</p>

<h3 id="california-will-produce-insulin-to-tackle-prices">California Will Produce Insulin To Tackle Prices</h3>
<p>“Nothing epitomizes market failures more than the cost of insulin. Many Americans experience out-of-pocket costs anywhere from $300 to $500 per month for this lifesaving drug. California is now taking matters into our own hands,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1545122879649374209">recent video</a>.</p>
<p>Insulin prices are astronomical. For reference, prices in the U.S. are almost <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4991dc2b-78c9-48c2-a1d1-f2a5b474f4e8_1986x1252.png">four times</a> as much as in Chile, which has the second highest prices of countries compared in a 2020 <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/cost-of-insulin-by-country">study</a>. California has the <a href="https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/living-well/decreasing-diabetes-prevalence/">highest number</a> of new diabetes cases in the country.</p>
<p>In order to confront the market and price gouging, California will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/08/california-will-lower-insulin-prices-by-making-its-own-newsom-says.html">invest</a> $100 million to develop much cheaper insulin and an in-state manufacturing facility. California’s investment is a helpful reminder that when it comes to basic health services people need, we should not be hostage to a rigged market setup.</p>

<h3 id="union-momentum-finds-strength-in-numbers">Union Momentum Finds Strength In Numbers</h3>
<p>Growing labor momentum is showing up in the data! This week, the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/first-three-quarters-union-election-petitions-up-56-exceeding-all-fy21">announced</a><a href="https://twitter.com/NLRBGC/status/1547225779515363328">that</a>, “During the first nine months of FY22, union representation petitions filed at the NLRB have increased 56 percent — up to 1,935 from 1,240 during the same period in FY21. At the same time, unfair labor practice charges have increased 14.5 percent — from 11,451 to 13,106.”</p>
<p>In addition to the NLRB report, a <a href="https://www.zoomshift.com/blog/union-search-statistics/">new study</a> from Zoomshift shows Google searches for “join union” in five states have jumped: Oregon (up 126 percent), Kansas (124 percent), and Iowa (115 percent) top the list, along with New Jersey (96 percent) and Alabama (57 percent).</p>
<h3 id="california-to-send-out-inflation-relief-checks">California To Send Out Inflation Relief Checks</h3>
<p>Amidst the avalanche of inflation news, California has announced it will provide <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-check-2022-california-inflation-relief-payments/">inflation relief checks</a> of up to $1,050 per family with dependents. The checks are part of a larger $17 billion-dollar <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/06/30/governor-newsom-signs-budget-putting-money-back-in-californians-pockets-and-investing-in-states-future/">relief package</a> that will suspend the state’s diesel sales tax and assist many in paying past-due utility bills. The relief will be issued <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-check-2022-california-inflation-relief-payments/">as soon</a> as October. About 23 million Californians are slated to receive checks, and contrary to what the Federal Reserve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/watch-now-the-fed-chairs-war-on-workers/">thinks</a>, getting money into the hands of families and workers will be vital during these hard times.</p>

<h3 id="congressional-staffers-demand-climate-action">Congressional Staffers Demand Climate Action</h3>
<p>“We’ve crafted the legislation necessary to avert climate catastrophe. It’s time for you to pass it,” 200 congressional staffers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/congress-staffers-climate-letter-pelosi-schumer/index.html">wrote</a> in a letter to Democratic leaders on Tuesday. The letter started circulating on Monday and quickly amassed support in lawmakers’ home districts.</p>
<p>“We are tired of the merry-go-round, and afraid of what inaction will mean for future generations and millions of lives all over the world,” one congressional staffer <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/congress-bill-pelosi-schumer-manchin-b2122272.html">told</a><em>The Independent</em>. Earlier in May, staffers <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/congress-staff-unions/">won a raise</a>, demonstrating what their organizing can accomplish. Representing a much younger generation, they are demanding urgent climate action and their organizing efforts will be important to getting key climate policy over the finish line.</p>
<h3 id="finally%E2%80%A6">Finally…</h3>
<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Rita Dove’s poem on second chances, <em>“<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51663/dawn-revisited"><em>Dawn Revisited</em></a>”</em>:</p>
<p><em>Imagine you wake up</em></p>
<p><em>with a second chance: The blue jay</em></p>
<p><em>hawks his pretty wares</em></p>
<p><em>and the oak still stands, spreading</em></p>
<p><em>glorious shade. If you don't look back,<br></em></p>
<p><em>the future never happens.</em></p>
<p><em>How good to rise in sunlight,</em></p>
<p><em>in the prodigal smell of biscuits —</em></p>
<p><em>eggs and sausage on the grill.</em></p>
<p><em>The whole sky is yours<br></em></p>
<p><em>to write on, blown open</em></p>
<p><em>to a blank page. Come on,</em></p>
<p><em>shake a leg! You'll never know</em></p>
<p><em>who's down there, frying those eggs,</em></p>
<p><em>if you don't get up and see.</em></p>
