<p>We all love a good truck, the problem is that most 'cool' old trucks are pretty run down. Never fear, however, because as long as there have been cool cars there have also been garage queens. <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1990-ford-f350-xlt-lariat/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This particular truck</a> was bought brand new in Chicago and driven to a garage space 1500 miles away and that's where this truck's journey ended for 30 years. Then after an extraordinary length of time, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1990-ford-f350-xlt-lariat/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this treasure</a> was brought out and put at auction. </p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to preserve the past, from supporting local museums to collecting family photos. We prefer garaging a classic truck like this <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1959 Chevrolet Apache Step Side</a>. Part of the legendary Task Force lineup of Chevy trucks, these were the successors to the Advance Design series released not too long after WWII. At the time American was on the up and up having saved the world. With the economy booming and optimism everywhere, it seemed like nothing was impossible. The strong, optimistic worth ethic of the country is embodied in this classic workhorse, which is currently for sale through <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike Midwest</a>.</p>
