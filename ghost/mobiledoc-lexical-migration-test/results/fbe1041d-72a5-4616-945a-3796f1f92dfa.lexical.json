But then he also declared that such austerity must be a long-term priority.</p><p>‚ÄúWe should be cutting spending and lowering the deficit,‚Äù said Biden, less than two years after the government <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ending-pandemic-aid-created-a-disaster/\">cut millions of Americans off pandemic aid</a>.</p><p>Though Biden has rightly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-heads-new-york-talk-debt-ceiling-raise-funds-re-election-2023-05-10/\">pressured</a> Republicans to stop using the debt ceiling as leverage in budget talks, this brief but significant line raises the possibility of the White House capitulating to at least some GOP demands for crushing spending cuts.</p><p>One day later, <em>Reuters</em> further <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-mccarthys-friday-debt-ceiling-meeting-postponed-white-house-says-2023-05-11/\">reported</a>: ‚ÄúWhite House officials acknowledge that they must accept some spending cuts or strict caps on future spending if they are to strike a deal, two sources said.‚Äù</p><p>This posture no doubt thrills the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33decf89-aeaf-4a7d-802a-715d057d1e81\">Wall Street donors Biden is now courting</a>, though it may surprise rank-and-file Democratic voters. It shouldn‚Äôt.</p><p>Though Biden was repackaged and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/us/politics/biden-wanted-an-fdr-presidency-hows-he-doing-so-far.html\">sold</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/opinions/franklin-roosevelt-joe-biden-100-days-gergen/index.html\">to voters as a 21st century FDR</a>, Clinton-style austerity has been <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/13/biden-cuts-social-security/\">his brand for most of his 40 years</a> in public life. In deliberately building that brand, he gave Senate <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4843746/user-clip-biden-freezing-social-security\">floor</a> <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4846580/user-clip-joe-biden-cut-ss-4-times\">speeches</a> touting his push to freeze government spending. He <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna18381961#.XhQqyy2ZPOR\">appeared on national television shows</a> touting a plan to put Social Security cuts on the table. He also <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/25/joe-biden-social-security/\">spearheaded an Obama administration committee</a> pressing for deals with Republicans to enact social spending cuts.</p><p>This should have been the kind of thing Democratic voters considered when choosing their presidential nominee in 2020. After all, whether or not a Democratic president would even consider bipartisan deals for big spending cuts is (to use a Biden-ism) a big f-ing deal.</p><p>But when Sen. Bernie Sanders (Ind.-Vt.) tried to elevate the issue, he was scoffed at and ridiculed by the political and media class.</p><p>As recounted by <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/01/24/media-headlines-obscure-joe-bidens-false-statements-on-cutting-social-security/\"><em>Fairness And Accuracy In Reporting</em></a>, much of the national press obscured the truth by casting Sanders‚Äô criticism of Biden‚Äôs austerity record as a he-said-she-said spat rather than a fact-based dispute. Then the press amplified Biden‚Äôs demand that Sanders‚Äô campaign apologize for citing a video in which Biden literally said Social Security and Medicare ‚Äúneeds adjustments.‚Äù</p><p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/12/bernie-sanders/sanders-misleading-social-security-attack-biden/\"><em>Politifact</em></a> soon went into aggressive disinformation mode: The fact-checking website labeled as ‚Äúmostly false‚Äù a Sanders advertisement simply replaying Biden‚Äôs Senate <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4843746/user-clip-biden-freezing-social-security\">floor</a> <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4846580/user-clip-joe-biden-cut-ss-4-times\">speeches</a> boasting about his support for freezing Social Security funding.</p><p>Emboldened by a media that made clear it would eagerly erase his record, Biden then channeled a Donald Trump-level of pathological dishonesty and <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/video/joe-biden-falsely-claims-he-never-called-for-social-security-cuts-024212661.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAAXLuaYpIXCiqEccjCRqJGfWJUL6S1f3L3kT5CkpgZokENaNt6rNPd3yL8fOjKV2WdviARPco6l3AAR5SL5wg30cMw6M8acSaQgWrNAa67cgsDym4s--SQ80qlZ0PX9FyYfRhPO4N7WooHkY2KsJX58IzGMwcmz9F47uHE-oXiA\">straight-up</a> <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/17/biden-fact-check-social-security-bankruptcy/\">lied</a> to the entire country on national television.</p><p>During a CNN debate, he insisted with a straight face that he had never tried to freeze or cut Social Security ‚Äî a <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/video/joe-biden-falsely-claims-he-never-called-for-social-security-cuts-024212661.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAAXLuaYpIXCiqEccjCRqJGfWJUL6S1f3L3kT5CkpgZokENaNt6rNPd3yL8fOjKV2WdviARPco6l3AAR5SL5wg30cMw6M8acSaQgWrNAa67cgsDym4s--SQ80qlZ0PX9FyYfRhPO4N7WooHkY2KsJX58IzGMwcmz9F47uHE-oXiA\">fabrication</a> that went almost completely unchallenged by the press.</p><p>Fast forward three years, and here is Biden signaling that to Republicans he may still be the Biden that he‚Äôs always been ‚Äî the Biden that Sanders warned about but that wasn‚Äôt allowed to be discussed when voters were choosing a Democratic nominee.</p><p>To be sure, there was a brief moment when Biden seemed ready to break with his austerian past. Thanks to constant pressure from activists, Biden supported a significant social spending bill at the beginning of his presidency, which <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/politics/cnn-poll-biden-covid-relief-bill/index.html\">boosted his poll numbers</a>.</p><p>But after the same media that buried his record started <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/how-pundits-inflation-myth-crushed-the-working-class/\">manufacturing a fake narrative</a> about inflation being driven by government spending rather than corporate profiteering, Biden returned to his comfort zone.</p><p>In the name of belt tightening, pandemic aid was <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ending-pandemic-aid-created-a-disaster/\">terminated</a>, millions were thrown off the expanded child tax credit and <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/temporary-pandemic-snap-benefits-will-end-in-remaining-35-states-in-march\">food stamps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/15-million-people-could-lose-medicaid-in-the-next-year-heres-what-the-research-says\">millions more are being thrown off Medicaid</a> ‚Äî and Biden‚Äôs campaign <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/promise/1586/expand-and-increase-social-security-benefits/#:~:text=%22To%20bolster%20retirement%20security%20for,have%20exhausted%20all%20other%20assets.\">promise</a> to expand Social Security has vanished. Meanwhile, the administration is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mstratford/status/1656697645786710020\">pledging to restart the collection of student debt payments</a>.</p><p>Of course, that was fiscal hawkery in name only ‚Äî it happened at the same time Biden led the fight for the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/10/biden-pentagon-budget-debt-ceiling-00082302\">largest Pentagon budget in American history</a>, as well as for <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/a-chip-off-the-old-bailout/\">legislation</a> handing billions of dollars to tech CEOs, who can use the cash for stock buybacks and executive payouts.</p><p>Same thing for Republicans, by the way ‚Äî they are pretending to care about the deficit, only a few years after they passed tax cuts for the wealthy that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/\">inflated the deficit</a>, while pushing to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/tough-tradeoffs-under-republican-work-requirement-plan-some-people-lose-medicaid-or-states-could-pay-to-maintain-coverage/\">inflict more pain on the poor</a> to help cover the bill.</p><p>If anyone in Washington actually cared about the national debt, they‚Äôd be talking about the enormous tax gap recently spotlighted by the Congressional Budget Office (which isn‚Äôt some liberal bastion ‚Äî it‚Äôs <a href=\"https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/one-more-republican-needs-to-go-head-of-cbo/\">run by a Republican</a>).</p><p>In one report, its experts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeverNews/status/1656384748841996288\">documented</a> how corporate profits have been increasing but corporate tax collections have remained flat. In another <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/59129.pdf\">report</a>, the office explicitly linked the debt-limit crisis to a revenue shortfall that ‚Äústems mainly from smaller-than-anticipated payments of individual and corporate income taxes.‚Äù</p><p>But making sure the rich and corporations pay their fair share in taxes is not part of the discussion. Indeed, Biden‚Äôs promise to lift the Social Security payroll tax cap has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/us/politics/biden-budget-social-security.html\">disappeared</a>, and he has refused to use his executive authority to close an <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/will-biden-end-an-illegal-50-billion-tax-giveaway/\">egregious tax loophole</a> primarily benefiting the wealthy.</p><p>Instead, the conversation is all about how much more can be cut from programs that help the working class.</p><p>Republicans are the drivers of that rigged discourse, but Biden is now part of it, too. Rather than take cues from a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/f409a864-d58c-430a-8adc-ee6a8a344854.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_7\">new poll</a> showing the public wants him to stand up against austerity, he went ahead and validated Republicans‚Äô austerity argument.</p><p>He may yet end up holding out (keep the pressure on!), but by insisting that ‚Äúwe should be cutting spending,‚Äù he has helped create the conditions for more brutal budget slashing ‚Äî just like he has for so much of his career.</p>"
