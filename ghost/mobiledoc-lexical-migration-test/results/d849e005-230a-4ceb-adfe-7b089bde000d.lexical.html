<p>It only takes one glance to see that this 1972 Dodge Challenger <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-build-2/">Restomod</a> is a serious custom machine. After all, the factory never made it this bright or slick. But while the paint radiates, so does the big power inside. With a six-speed sequential gearbox, race-ready interior, upgraded suspension, and an Ernie Elliott 440 V8, this was built to bring some serious muscle to the streets. The story we're told is that this has only about 1k miles on it since it's full restoration.</p>
