After all, the man is loaded and certainly didn’t need the endorsement, which in the minds of many would be the only reason for his pushing the Korean brand. The truth is King James was already driving a K900 before Kia contacted him about the endorsement. It’s not only a big sedan, many who have given it an honest shot have been shocked at how refined and comfortable it is. LeBron’s endorsement helped build awareness, but we don’t expect the K900 to now be seen more favorably than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7 Series anytime soon."
