<p>Bred on the battlefields, the Mercedes-Benz Gel√§ndewagen celebrated its 40th birthday last year, and to celebrate that milestone, <a href="https://expeditionmotorcompany.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Expedition Motor Company</a> of Frenchtown, New Jersey started restoring and importing old military-spec 250GD models to the U.S. The result is nothing short of amazing with these bespoke off-roaders being rebuilt by hand from the ground up with a frame-off, nut-and-bolt restoration. This particular example is a gorgeous <a href="https://expeditionmotorcompany.com/builds/1993-250gd-wolf-091413/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">1993 Mercedes-Benz 250GD</a> painted in Mojave Silver with a brown interior and black soft top.</p>

<p>After being decommissioned from military service, each "Wolf" built by Expedition Motor Company undergoes an exhaustive restoration in Europe that takes more than 1,000 hours and about 16 to 20 weeks to complete. "Wolf" was the nickname given to specific military versions of the G-Wagen that must be 250GD models equipped with a convertible soft top and a folding windshield.</p>

<p>Rather than being restomodded, these two-door convertible G-Wagens are mildly updated with LED exterior lighting and a custom interior consisting of a quartet of saddle-colored vinyl seats and stitched wrappings on the steering wheel, transmission shift lever and transfer case shifter. All of the body lines are kept to factory spec as is the removable soft top, and the black steel wheels wrapped in meaty BFGoodrich tires show that this SUV means business.</p>

<p>Under that body is a frame that has been completely restored along with the axles and the components for the brakes, suspension and steering. The 2.5-liter OM602 five-cylinder diesel engine has been removed, inspected and rebuilt, and it's still paired with the five-speed transmission and manual transfer case.</p>
<p>Bottom line, <a href="https://expeditionmotorcompany.com/%23about-us?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Expedition Motor Company</a> will build you a vintage G-Wagen that has far more character than a brand-new G-Class, and this turn-key restoration is available for $92,150. Considering that small-body Broncos are getting surprisingly close to this price point, a like-new mil-spec G-Wagen will always win on the trails and at the car shows.</p>
