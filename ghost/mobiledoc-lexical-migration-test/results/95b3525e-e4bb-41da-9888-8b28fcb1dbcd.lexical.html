<p>As is the case with any customized motorcycle, the genius in these two BMWs is the simplicity of the design. Clean lines allow your eye to just glide ride over them, while the simple paint schemes play that up further. LED lights and a digital display add a decidedly modern touch, plus both have keyless ignition.</p>

<p>Of course, both of these BMWs feature the German brand’s well-regarded boxer twin engine displacing 980cc. Many riders can testify to the durability and reliability of these workhorses when they’re properly serviced. They’re also responsive and balanced, giving exactly what you ask from them.</p>

<p>Vintage valve covers and velocity stacks add to the customized feel of these motorcycles, plus there are Bayer aluminum engine covers with the airboxes deleted. The pie-cut stainless steel exhausts add to the flair of these rides without getting too wild.</p>
