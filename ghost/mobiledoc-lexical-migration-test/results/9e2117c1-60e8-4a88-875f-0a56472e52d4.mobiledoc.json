          "Foose really admired the fact the Chevrolet Corvette has had an evolutionary design he says is second only to the Porsche 911. Already he’s not winning over ‘Vette fans with that statement, but what he says next is even more of a gem. He thinks GM made too far of a leap in design for the C8. What’s with sticking the engine mid-ship on the car? Why when Foose was a youngling he could buy a hamburger for $0.90 and Corvettes had long, luxurious hoods to spread out on for watching the stars at night (fact checkers: I made that part up, it's what humans call a joke)."

I think it’s a noble effort and I can’t fault him for attempting it, but I also can’t believe nobody within the design team thought of such a thing. Perhaps there was a reason why they didn’t ultimately go down that path?"

As for the end result, it really lacks the in-your-face, exotic nature so many people seem to absolutely love about the C8. In other words, I think it’s too vanilla for such a machine. At least it’s not horrible and it’s not looking at its own rear quarters, so there’s that. Let us know what you think of Foose’s work in the comments."
