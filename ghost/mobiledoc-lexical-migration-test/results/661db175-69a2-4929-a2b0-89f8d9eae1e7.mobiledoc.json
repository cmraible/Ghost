With a perfect patina and loads of nostalgic cache, finding a workhorse like this that hasn’t been made ridiculously plush in one way or another is becoming increasingly difficult."

The tow shop icons on the doors along with the vintage “Towing” script on the side of the rear kit just scream nostalgia and add some character to this ride."

There’s a 350ci V8 GM crate engine installed, so you don’t have to pray before turning the ignition key each time. There’s also a modern Edelbrock carb, aluminum intake, and HEI distributor. Someone even installed an AC compressor and what looks to be a new alternator."
