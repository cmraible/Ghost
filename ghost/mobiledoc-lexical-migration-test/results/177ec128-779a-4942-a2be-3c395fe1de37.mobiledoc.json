They’re not the greatest, that’s for sure, so to keep a car which is so low to the ground in beautiful cosmetic and mechanical condition is no small feat. He obviously is quite careful. Also, he likely knows the different pitfalls in the stretches of road around the area, kind of like how you know where the killer potholes or loose gravel is on the roads in your city."

In other words, he’s a fan of little cars from Europe. While it might not be our cup of tea, we can certainly appreciate his enthusiasm for these vehicles and how immaculately restored they are."
