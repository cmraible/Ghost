<p>Friends,</p>
<p>This has been a huge week for the country — and <em>The Lever</em>. And we could not have done it without the support of our paid subscribers.</p>
<p>On Monday, we broke a massive story we had been working on with <em>ProPublica</em> for months. We exposed how an ultra-secretive Chicago businessman delivered the largest known U.S. political advocacy donation to a dark money group controlled by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/he-man-who-bought-the-supreme-court/">Leonard Leo</a>, the prime architect of conservatives’ efforts to reshape the judicial system. The exposé, which shed new light on how dark money is transforming the country’s political landscape, went viral, with the story’s lead author, Andrew Perez, appearing in media outlets nationwide. We link to several of his appearances below.</p>
<p>Then, on Wednesday, President Joe Biden agreed to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student loan debt for those earning less than $125,000 annually. The decision did not come easily — the president has long been a proponent of saddling Americans with debilitating debt, and, as our team uncovered, his Justice Department has made a habit of fighting student debtor victories in federal court. We have been covering the matter for years, amping up pressure on the Biden administration to act on its promise to help beleaguered student loan borrowers. We showcase the most important stories we’ve written on the struggle for debt cancellation below.</p>
<p>These developments are a powerful reminder of why <em>The Lever</em> exists. This is the sort of reporting that all too often corporate media refuses to do, so it is thrilling to see that our work is making a difference.</p>
<p>Read all about it in this week’s Lever Weekly, exclusively for supporting subscribers below.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our team, and helping us continue this work. We couldn’t do it without you.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of the reporting we have done to hold Biden accountable on his promise to address the student debt crisis:</p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-and-student-debt-a-40-year/"><strong>Biden & Student Debt: A 40-Year Love Affair</strong></a> (Feb. 23, 2021) — <em>“Throughout his career, Biden has had a reputation for being on the side of lenders. Between 2003 and 2008, he took $500,000 from the lending industry. In 2005, he was one of 25 Democrats to sign onto Republican-led bankruptcy reform legislation that removed protections on private student loans. The bill was considered a giveaway to lenders and helped create a $125 billion bubble in private student loan debt. For Biden, that kind of immiseration is not a new cause.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-moves-to-block-student-debt-victory/"><strong>Biden Moves To Block Student Debt Victory</strong></a> (Feb 2, 2022) — <em>“Despite increasing pressure to fulfill a campaign promise to forgive student debt, President Joe Biden is now going in the opposite direction: His administration has taken an initial step to try to overturn a key legal victory for borrowers, according to court filings reviewed by </em>The Lever<em>.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-withdrawing-student-debt-appeal-after-outcry/"><strong>Biden Withdrawing Student Debt Appeal After Outcry</strong></a> (Feb 4, 2022) — <em>“The Biden administration is abruptly withdrawing its attempt to block a major court ruling that could protect student borrowers, according to a new statement provided to </em>The Lever<em>. The announcement comes 48 hours after </em>The Lever <em>broke the news that the administration had moved to appeal the ruling, which could help the poorest borrowers who are being bankrupted by education debt.”</em></p>
<p><em>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/despite-pledge-biden-still-fighting-student-debtors-in-court/"><strong>Despite Pledge, Biden Still Fighting Student Debtors In Court</strong></a></em> (Feb. 10, 2022) — <em>“Last week, the Department of Education abruptly stopped trying to overturn a bankruptcy court victory for a struggling student loan borrower after </em>The Lever<em>’s reporting on the case went viral. But there are still dozens of cases where the Biden administration is fighting federal student loan borrowers who are trying to eliminate their debts through bankruptcy, according to court records reviewed by </em>The Lever.</p>

<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-biden-faces-mounting-pressure-on-student-debt/"><strong>YOU LOVE TO SEE IT: Biden Faces Mounting Pressure On Student Debt</strong></a> (Feb. 12, 2022) — <em>“At a Friday press conference on student debt cancellation, </em>The Lever <em>asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) if he supported these organizations’ demand [to drop its cases against student loan borrowers]. ‘Yes, absolutely,’ he said, adding, ‘It’s outrageous that other people get to declare bankruptcy but students can’t,’ referring to the carve-out for student debt in bankruptcy that makes it very challenging for people declaring bankruptcy to have their student loans discharged.”</em></p>
<p><em>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-dems-biden-student-debtors/"><strong>Senate Dems Demand Biden Stop Crushing Student Debtors</strong></a></em> (April 1, 2022) — <em>“Senate Democrats are demanding the Biden administration back off its attempts to overturn court rulings that help student debtors. The new demands were prompted by </em>The Lever<em>’s original series showing the administration has been betraying Biden’s campaign promise to allow borrowers to discharge their student debts through bankruptcy. Instead, the administration has fought debtors in bankruptcy court.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cheat-sheet-the-truth-about-student-debt/"><strong>CHEAT SHEET: The Truth About Student Debt</strong></a> (April 14, 2022) — <em>“At the end of the day, there is one truth that matters: Biden has the authority to do more than just pause student loan repayment, yet he’s been reluctant to do so, despite the broad appeal and notable benefits of opting for a permanent cancellation and moving toward making public colleges and universities free.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-means-test-con/"><strong>The Means-Test Con</strong></a> (May 2, 2022) — <em>“In trial-ballooning the college debt relief proposal, Biden is boosting the media-manufactured fiction that real, universal college debt relief would mostly help rich Ivy League kids — even though data from the Roosevelt Institute conclusively proves that canceling student debt ‘would provide more benefits to those with fewer economic resources and could play a critical role in addressing the racial wealth gap and building the Black middle class.’”</em></p>
