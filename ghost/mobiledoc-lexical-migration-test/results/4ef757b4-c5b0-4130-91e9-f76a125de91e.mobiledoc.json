After a 25-year hiatus, the Bronco name will return for the 2021 model year, and it will be a traditional body-on-frame SUV available in two- and four-door configurations with a rear-mounted spare tire and removable doors and top. Unlike the Jeep Wrangler, the Bronco's removable components will be stowable in the cargo area. By the time the sixth-gen Bronco launches, Ford also plans on having a full assortment of accessories for dealers to sell."
