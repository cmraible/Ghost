That might be a shock to many regular people who don’t come near to even blowing what new Nissan Versa costs to go on however many trips they take in a year. That kind of disparity no doubt means this news will irk quite a few people, particularly those who have been financially ravaged from losing their job or being furloughed thanks to the government-mandated shutdowns."

In fact, Aston Martin is no longer unprofitable after years of the British brand being in the red. Bentley, also from the UK, has recovered from less-than-stellar sales in the recent past. About the only exclusive brand which hasn’t just blown things out of the water is Rolls-Royce. The old mainstay in ultra-luxury automobiles had just begun retooling its factory for the new Ghost when the pandemic struck, and that’s what it’s citing for the 26 percent drop in sales last year."

In fact, one Bentley executive was quoted in a recent report stating, “It would take more than a pandemic to knock us off track again.”"
