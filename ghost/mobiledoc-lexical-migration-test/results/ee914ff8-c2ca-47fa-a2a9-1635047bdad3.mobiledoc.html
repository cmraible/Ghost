<p>West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin’s Washington boat, the Almost Heaven, has become a media darling, a place that corporate news outlets describe as a folksy political hideaway filled with pizza, beer, and unpretentious vibes. As a recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/joe-manchin-boat/2021/08/05/a3575508-f5e7-11eb-a49b-d96f2dac0942_story.html"><em>Washington Post</em> puff piece</a> put it, the vessel, which has become a key meeting place of beltway VIPs, is “somewhere between a trawler and a yacht” and “a place for Hawaiian shirts and shorts… instead of suits and ties.”</p>
<p>But before Manchin purchased it in 2013, the <em>Post</em> described this vessel very differently.</p>

<p>“A catastrophic failure of U.S. journalism and politics is that something like Biden's 10-year, $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill is not called a $350 billion annual bill… but the Pentagon's budget, which will exceed $7.5 trillion over a decade, is called a $750 billion annual bill” —  Northwestern University Journalism Professor <a href="https://twitter.com/thrasherxy/status/1443367035610730499?s=19">Steven Thrasher</a></p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>As corporate West Virginian Democrat Joe Manchin leans into his role as one of his party’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-bank-bailout/">most craven spoilers</a>, Almost Heaven, the 65-by-20-foot boat he lives in on the Potomac when he’s in Washington has become a star.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/joe-manchin-boat/2021/08/05/a3575508-f5e7-11eb-a49b-d96f2dac0942_story.html"><em>Washington Post</em> puff piece</a> declared, “Washington’s hottest club is Joe Manchin’s houseboat,” and went on to describe it as “a crucial destination for members of Official Washington” and the site of core group dealings on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/02/lindsey-graham-covid-19-breakthrough-infection/">tested positive for COVID-19</a> after a weekend cruise on the vessel, and a recent video captured Manchin <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a37824383/joe-manchin-yacht-activists-reconciliation-bill/">lecturing on the importance of fiscal responsibility</a> to a group of protesters who had kayaked up to the boat to demand he support a reconciliation bill that makes a transformative investment in the lives of most Americans.</p>
<p>Recent corporate media descriptions of Almost Heaven have framed it as a quirky, homey houseboat. The <em>Washington Post</em> story described it as “somewhere between a trawler and a yacht” and “a place for Hawaiian shirts and shorts (Manchin’s go-to boat attire) instead of suits and ties, where senators dine on pizza from Harris Teeter or pasta platters from Nostra Cocina.” A <a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/joe-manchin-the-outlier-time-magazine">2014 <em>Time</em> magazine piece</a> agreed, depicting it as an informal space of pizza, beer, and the occasional merlot. And a June <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/28/the-man-who-controls-the-senate"><em>New Yorker</em> Manchin profile</a> said “it resembles a small ferry” that “provides an offshore venue for the kind of casual evening that Manchin considers vital to politics.”</p>
<p>Most of these articles mention that while a 2018 Republican attack ad called the vessel a “$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht,” Manchin’s office reported he bought it used for $220,000.</p>
<p>But before Manchin purchased the vessel in 2013, corporate media described it very differently. According to a 2004 <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2004/04/25/at-home-on-the-water/df8f67d5-8c28-4845-82d4-e407523a7b0e/">article</a> on the boat, then called the Jennifer Anne, “You could call it a houseboat, but that would be like calling Air Force One a plane.”</p>
<p>The rest of the piece reads like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4N9OA6MYYM">Robin Leach voiceover</a> from <em>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</em>: “The 1,500 square feet of interior living space embrace 3 1/2 bedrooms (including a 14-by-20-foot master suite), 3 1/2 bathrooms, and a bright and open living/dining area (complete with a granite dining table) where the DeLanceys have comfortably entertained as many as 50 people to watch a Blue Angels air show or the colorful start of major yacht races on the bay.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>And that anecdote about how Manchin only spent $220,000 on the vessel? He clearly knew he had scored a good deal on the ship, since <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4946154-Coast-Guard">he has it insured</a> at a market value of $700,000.</p>
<p>Such misleading descriptions of Manchin’s floating mansion are par for the course for the corporate media, which has long mischaracterized the coal baron from West Virginia. Take how the <em>Time </em>piece on the Almost Heaven described the senator, who has now stalled the Biden administration’s $3.5 trillion social safety net legislation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-bank-bailout/">amid false platitudes</a> about the risks of “moving towards an entitlement mentality.” According to that article, Manchin has “a bias toward action rather than rhetoric.”</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>In 1995, the United States government <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1445605389702086660?s=21">dropped a requirement</a> for pharmaceutical companies to set “reasonable” prices for new drugs they create with the help of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. The clause’s elimination <a href="__GHOST_URL__/drugmakers-want-vaccine-pricing-decisions/">recently allowed</a> COVID vaccine manufacturers that received upwards of $10 billion in taxpayer funding to avoid offering fair prices for their drugs. <br></p>
<p>Now Merck is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/05/covid-pill-drug-pricing-merck-ridgeback/">charging the U.S. government $712 per five-day course</a> for a promising new COVID-19 treatment that costs only $17.74 to make. The company used NIH and Department of Defense funding to create Molnupiravir, the drug that is now being sold at 40 times the price of production. As soon as the medication receives FDA emergency use authorization, Merck will receive $1.2 billion from the government to supply 1.7 million courses of the drug at the $712 price. </p>

    <li><strong>HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER STEVEN DONZIGER FACES PRISON TIME: </strong>Human rights and environmental justice attorney Steven Donziger was sentenced on Friday to six months in federal prison for “criminal contempt” as part of Chevron’s <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/steven-donziger-chevron-sentencing/">long legal vendetta against him</a>. Donziger had spent decades fighting, and in 2013, winning, a landmark case against Chevron for polluting the Ecuadorian rainforest. “I have been attacked and demonized for years by Chevron in retaliation for helping Indigenous peoples in Ecuador try to do something to save their cultures, their lives, and our planet in the face of massive oil pollution,” said Donziger during his sentencing hearing. A day later, the same judge who charged him <a href="https://twitter.com/sdonziger/status/1445495296213991431?s=21">ordered Indigenous Amazonians</a> to pay Chevron’s steep legal fees.</li>

Last month, U.S. Special Envoy to Haiti Daniel Foote also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/23/us-haiti-migrant-deportations-513833">left</a> the administration in response to its decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and undocumented immigrants.</li>
