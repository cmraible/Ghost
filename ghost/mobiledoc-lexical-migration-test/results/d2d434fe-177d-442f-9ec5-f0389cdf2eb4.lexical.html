<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>Let me start off by thanking everyone who responded to our <a href="/personal-request/">fundraising ask</a> last week — we got so many great responses and it has really helped us. We are trying to expand our coverage as we head into the final weeks of the election, and your support is helping make that possible. And if you didn’t see our original ask, <a href="/personal-request/">click here</a> to see three ways you can still help.</p>
<p>Last week was one of the most intense weeks of political news I’ve ever seen. It was just endless news every minute of the day. I don’t even know how to organize my thoughts after it, other than to just offer up some random takeaways.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Senate has to halt the Supreme Court confirmation. The entire process is not only illegitimate, it is now wildly unsafe. The U.S. Capitol is a hot zone. Are we really going to see lawmakers on the floor of the Senate in <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1312139390114816000">full-on space suits</a>?</p>
<p>Of course, Mitch McConnell says he is moving forward. That’s hardly surprising — for McConnell, every single day is Game of Thrones. This is why in the battle for power and policy, mcConnell typically wins and Democrats typically lose. Jed Bartlet isn’t coming to save us.</p>
<p>Expecting McConnell and the Republicans will make responsible decisions seems silly. They aren’t going to refrain from holding floor votes out of some humanistic desire to avoid knowingly infecting other lawmakers and staff. They just do not care. They are T-1000 Terminators for a corporate agenda.</p>
<p>All of that means Democrats are going to have to use all of their power if there is any hope to stop the nomination. And we will be covering that story.</p>
<p>Speaking of coverage, we’ve been breaking really big stories — and when you look at the clips below, keep in mind that all those stories are being produced by a small team. I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to do.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in journalism for many years, and I have found this political and media environment to be among the most challenging I’ve ever faced. It’s difficult to know how to deploy limited reporting resources and which stories to focus on when there is just so much happening. We always want and need your input — so don’t hesitate to send me an email.</p>
<p>One thing I can say: when we make story selection decisions, we always try to follow the money and the power — and we couldn’t do it without your support. Your subscription is giving us the resources to do this work and make the impact we’re making. As always, thank you for being part of our team.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
