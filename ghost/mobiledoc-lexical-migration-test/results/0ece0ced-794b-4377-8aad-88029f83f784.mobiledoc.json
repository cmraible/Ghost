          "Let this be a reminder to everyone reading this who owns even just one classic to invest in a fire suppression system. You don’t even need to be working on your car in a space for it to catch fire, or for something else in the garage, etc. to spark a blaze that spreads quickly. The fuel, tires, and other parts of your vehicle will do nicely to keep any fire burning nice and strong. If you own multiple cars, that’s just more fuel for a potential fire. Stop delaying and get a fire suppression system and while you’re at it see if your insurance provider gives you a discount for having one."
