          "Let this be a reminder to everyone reading this who owns even just one classic to invest in a fire suppression system. You donâ€™t even need to be working on your car in a space for it to catch fire, or for something else in the garage, etc. to spark a blaze that spreads quickly. The fuel, tires, and other parts of your vehicle will do nicely to keep any fire burning nice and strong. If you own multiple cars, thatâ€™s just more fuel for a potential fire. Stop delaying and get a fire suppression system and while youâ€™re at it see if your insurance provider gives you a discount for having one."
