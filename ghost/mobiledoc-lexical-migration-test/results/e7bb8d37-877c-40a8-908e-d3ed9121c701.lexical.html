<p>Here we go again. In the past I’ve had to call Pando out for reusing my photos without attribution and payment. The last time they ‘fessed up, coughed up and I donated the proceeds to Cancer Research:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I work with PandoDaily on the financial side of the business. I want to apologize for the use of your photos without the proper credit/payment. This was an oversight on the part of our editorial team, and we’re taking steps to insure that this does not continue.</p>
    <p>We will be happy to pay you for the use of the 3 photos on the website. We have a standard rate of $50 per photograph, illustration, or other graphic used on the site.</p>

<p>And here’s my original in <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2011/12/le_web_dave_morins_path_from_facebook.html">my liveblog from 2011</a>:</p>

<p>My image. No credit. No payment.</p>
<p>The irony here, of course, is that Pando makes such a thing of their ethical superiority over other outlets. Let those without sin…</p>
<h2 id="update-photo-changed">UPDATE: Photo changed</h2>
<p>No contact from Pando, but all of a sudden, the photo’s changed:</p>

<p>I’ll update this if I hear anything from them.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
