However, Dennis Collins is one of the best in the business, using techniques to uncover awesome cars in unlikely spots. This time around he rescues a 1966 Chevy Corvette Stingray during a Colorado snowstorm."

Instead, the little red sports car was kept in a shed in the backyard. There’s no way they could’ve gotten the truck and trailer back there. As Collins correctly notes, it never hurts to show up to the job with too many tools. Sometimes, the extra stuff is exactly what you need but didn’t know it."

The black interior is basic but mostly there, with the exception of the door panels. But it does have a four-speed transmission and the heirs of the car threw in an old ’66 Stingray coffee mug, so that’s a nice plus."
