<p>Although most collectors appreciate the likes of Ferrari's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=F40">F40,</a> or even the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=F355">F355</a>, we secretly long for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Ferrari+308">Ferrari 308</a>. The model's recognition is immediately assisted by the fact it remains one of Ferrari’s most successful models in the marque's decorated history, having produced over 12,000 units over the course of its staggering 10-year production run. Oh yeah, and that <em>Magnum P.I</em> image...</p>
<p>Whilst the 308 itself is a fine piece of design, some may recognise its stockier brother. The drop-dead handsome one that resides in our automotive hall of fame - the 288 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/five-quick-facts-about-the-pontiac-gto/">GTO</a>. The car that was homologated for Group B rallying, yet never saw a single starting grid as the class was banned.</p>

<p>The 308 enjoyed two engine variants throughout its life cycle, with subtle differences attributed to each during a decade-long stint. One of which was a tiny V8 offered with just 2.0-liters worth of displacement, offered in the 208 models.</p>
<p>Released in 1975 at the Paris Motor Show, the 308 replaced the now highly sought after Dino 246 range. Although perhaps its most recognisable role is thanks to a certain heartthrob by the name of Tom Sellick, from <em>Magnum P.I</em>.</p>

<p>The car featured <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/283450912519?ul_noapp=true">here</a> is possibly the most sought after from the range, and was built in the penultimate year of production in 1983. Dubbed the Quattrovalvole it features, as the name suggests, four valves per cylinder with a mid-mounted 2.9 liter V8.</p>
<p>Not only does <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/283450912519?ul_noapp=true">this</a> stunning Ferrari host the cream of the crop in terms of power plants, but it also has a trophy to boot, including the highest concours award possible at Celebration Exotic Car Show. It even features the same colour combination as Thomas Magnum’s very own.</p>
<p>Unlike the choked-up American versions with power sapping catalytic converters, this one is actually a European model with the higher power output of 240 horsepower and dry sump lubrication. There can’t be many of these available on American soil, time to snap it up!</p>
