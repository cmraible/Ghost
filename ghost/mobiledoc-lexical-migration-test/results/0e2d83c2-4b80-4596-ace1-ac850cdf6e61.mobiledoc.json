This overall dark scheme makes the white wheels and what brightwork is left on the grille, bumpers, and such really pop. Shaved door handles keep everyone’s attention on that smooth body."

Even more importantly, a Chevrolet 350ci V8 crate engine with three dual-barrel Rochester carbs on top puts loads of power on tap. The aluminum radiator and electric fans keep this setup from running too hot, especially when you’re idling. Helping this truck to really sing are ceramic-coated headers and a dual exhaust system. But this truck isn’t just about the power, thanks to a Thorbecke tubular front suspension and four-link setup in the rear. Power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, and an automatic transmission make this truck easier to handle."
