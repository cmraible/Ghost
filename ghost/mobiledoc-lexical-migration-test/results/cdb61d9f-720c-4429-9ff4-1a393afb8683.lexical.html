<p>The LSE's Charlie Beckett takes a nuanced view of how the emerging breeds of niche newsletter creators fit into the overall evolution of the media ecosystem. He's clearly no more impressed with the general hype than I am, but the place he goes is valuable and interesting. </p>
<p>How can we take the best of the lessons from individual content creators, be they influencers or newsletter successes, and incorporate them into bigger news organisations?</p>
<blockquote>But the idea of a ‚Äònews organisation‚Äô at scale with an established brand, history and audience is valuable. I have long argued that these fortresses need to open up, become more diverse in their workforce and content, adapt to new networks and build more interactive, engaged relationships with their audiences. Mainstream journalism needs to be reinvented.</blockquote>
<p>As an industry, we're really not good enough ‚Äî yet ‚Äî at looking around ourselves and learning lessons from outside journalism. We need to do more of it. </p>

<h2 id="morning-brew-brews-up-a-sale">Morning Brew brews up a sale</h2>
<p>A newletter startup looks like it's about to be bought by <em>Business Insider. </em>Again, this is something the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/10/understanding-editorial-newsletters-a-brief-guide/">focus on star journalists with newsletters misses</a>: people have been quietly building successful businesses in this space for <em>years</em>. <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com">Morning Brew</a> (the business) is five years old and has 3 million subscribers. But, because they're doing business reporting, rather than mainstream news reporting, we don't get the breathless coverage about it.</p>
<p>As ever, it's much easier to get someone to pay for something when it's the company paying, not their personal credit card. Plenty of scope yet for great B2B newsletters, I think. </p>

<p>WordPress now allows you to turn your blogposts into tweetstorms automatically. I may have been unfair with the headline, but the idea of people just spamming Twitter with their longer form thoughts fills me with some dread.

<p>This is one for the techie and product people.
