<hr>
<p>There’s plenty that’s undeniably charming about the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tim-allen-roadster/">Ford Roadster</a>, a car that’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-military-vehicle/">about as American as apple pie</a>. A mainstay in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">hot rod culture</a>, the classic car from the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gale-halderman/">Blue Oval</a> is beloved not only for its charming good looks but also the ease of customization and a low curb weight. All of these positive attributes have been very much maximized in this build, which even includes quite a few modern amenities.</p>

<p>Underneath the butterfly hood is a 350ci small block V8 which has been modded with a 4bbl carb, Holley dominator intake, stainless steel shorty headers, Walker aluminum radiator, and HEI distributor. A three-speed automatic sends power to the rear wheels, where an independent rear like what you find on a Corvette provides the right level of grip. Up front is a four-link suspension. Toto tires provide good grip, while four-wheel power disc brakes help further with control.</p>

<p>That curvaceous body is a Gibbon fiberglass package, which adheres closely to the original panels, so you get the correct look. Covering that is a metallic silver which sparkles in the sunlight. Nearly perfect brightwork and intricate pinstriping done by Divine One Customs really highlight what makes this car so dazzling to see. Bonspeed alloy wheels add to that effect without detracting from the body lines. No matter where you take this Roadster, it will get people noticing and talking in a hurry.</p>

<p>Also included is a black removable top, for when you want to drive this car and the weather isn’t so accommodating. The back window is made of glass, showing that no corners were cut with this build.</p>

<p>A clean presentation for the black interior shows much thought and effort was put into this build. Recaro bucket seats offer large padded bolsters and extendable thigh support, so you can sit comfortably for long drives. You’ll also stay entertained with the AM/FM/CD stereo with USB input. A banjo sports steering wheel, AutoMeter gauges, and Lokar floor shifter also keep everything looking like it belongs.</p>
