The only weird part about the design is the factory rake of the windshield that makes the front end look a little too tall. The quality of work that went into this build is commendable, but the hardest part was probably getting those wide front fenders to blended seamlessly into the front doors. Well done! The best part of the whole design has to be the rear end where the \"CHEVROLET\" lettering is spelled out across the back; Chevy should take note of this for the factory Tahoe."
