<hr>
<p>A man in Wolfforth, Texas went to a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/used-car-prices-soar-pandemic/">used car</a> lot and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-almost-kill-employee/">took a BMW out for a test drive</a>. Then he used that Bimmer as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thief-takes-porsche-911-gts-on-a-shockingly-short-getaway-drive/">getaway car</a> after robbing a bank, using the cash from the robbery <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-man-porsche-911-turbo/">to purchase the car</a>. We’re sure Eric Dion Warren thought he was being <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/vehicle-rebirthing-growing/">super clever</a> or something like that, but his plan unraveled quickly and he soon found himself in a jail cell.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn how car thieves almost killed a dealership employee for a used BMW M4 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-almost-kill-employee/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>This genius plan involved the guy walking into the bank with an empty fast food paper sack. He put that and a not on the teller counter, indicating he had a gun and was ready to kill anyone who wanted to “play” with him. The note also directed the teller to give him $10,000 in large bills, since those are so much easier to use and all. Like we said, not exactly a criminal mastermind.</p>
<p>Just to make his eventual sentencing worse, Warren at one point pulled out a pellet gun and said, “I ain’t playing around, I only want 100s and 50s.” This is why a pellet gun ban, along with a Dodge Charger ban, is so urgent.</p>
<p>That’s when the teller threw a bunch of money in the bag, including a bundle of marked 20s. In total, he received $5,086 for his misdeed, which he greedily took back to the dealership and did the only sensible thing: buy the car he just used to commit aggravated robbery. A dumber criminal would’ve ditched the car afterward and disappeared into the wind, although 5 grand doesn’t go as far as one might think.</p>
<p>All those carefully hatched plans came undone when police called the dealership where Warren was going through the lengthy car buying process. They saw the dealer tags on the car, so that was a logical starting point. Luckily for them, the criminal was dumb enough to return to the dealership.</p>
<p>While the crime originally took place in the summer of 2019, Warren wasn’t sentenced until recently. He’s now serving a 20-year prison sentence. But at least he got the BMW for a few minutes, right?</p>
