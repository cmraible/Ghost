This particular gathering of automobiles showcases all three of the aforementioned attractions. So what is it about this collection that makes it so attractive?",

Having been very successful in his day, the artist purchased a home sometime in the late 1700s. After their eventual passing, the house went to a very wealthy heiress who apparently had a bit of an affection for automobiles. The heiress lived on until 1914, and the property would inevitably be auctioned off in 1952 and then resold in 1958. Since then, the house has been a hotel and tourist attraction and eventually was abandoned. That's what gives the exterior such a haunting vibe.",

Somewhere down the line, after being purchased by its current owner, the house was set for some significant renovations. These were likely the owners' property, but eventually, restoration was shut down after the owner fell on some hard times. Another exciting part of this house is one of the rooms used to grow weed and still holds some equipment. Overall, this is a property shrouded in mystery and will continue to be the center of much speculation by neighbors and explorers alike for many years to come.",
