          " was an iconically designed bus that was introduced in the 1950’s. Although it went on to represent the counterculture movement of the 1960’s, the Microbus was so much more than a hippie van to many enthusiasts. Despite its popularity, it is not very common to see one of these today and examples in good condition can be considered quite rare. That, combined with an eye-catching restoration, is what makes this "

Any rusted metal that could not be repaired by sandblasting was replaced with new metal before being professionally painted along with the rest of the undercarriage, interior, and exterior. The underside was painted black and the exterior was finished in Navy Blue and White. Sticking with the theme, the interior was painted white before being upholstered in Navy Blue and White Sunbrella fabric and accented with bamboo paneling, trim, and floors."
