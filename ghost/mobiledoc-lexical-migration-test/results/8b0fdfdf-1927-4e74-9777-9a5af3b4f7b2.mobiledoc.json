Approximately 10 years ago, the car went under the knife for a full no-stone-left-unturned restoration, and the engine and transmission were both rebuilt at the same time. Since its completion, a mere 100 miles have been clocked."

Peeking underneath the car, the undercarriage looks to be in perfect shape with no signs of cancerous rust can be found. The deep Gray Metallic paint is still in excellent condition, and that also rings true for the brown and cream-colored vinyl interior complete with woodgrain accents. The whole  exterior aesthetic wouldn't be complete without the fancy whitewall tires on all four corners."
