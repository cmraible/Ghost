<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-block-hoonifox/">Ken Block</a> is the hoonigan we all know and love known for his insane antics while piloting a bunch of high-horsepower and <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/">epic rides</a> in his Gymkhana series. Recently, Block announced a new partnership with Wheel Pros, the parent company of Rotiform, American Racing, Fuel Off-Road, Kinesis, and American Force. Ken will be teaming up with these brands to release signature designs such as KB1 wheels to be offered by Rotiform and The Block by Fuel Off-Road which will be available for pre-order this fall through <a href="https://www.hoonigan.com/pages/carcaine?utm_source=duPont_Registry&utm_medium=duPont_Daily_Article&utm_campaign=kenblockwheels">Carcaine Part Supply</a>'s website. In celebration of this new collaboration and partnership, Block decided to grab his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">massive fleet of cars</a> and show off their new shoes.</p>
<p>One would think they might know what Ken Block's fleet looks like if they keep up with Gymkhana, but it may go deeper than you think. Check out Ken's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/amazing-car-collection-is-hidden-in-tennessee/">amazing car</a> collection below.</p>
