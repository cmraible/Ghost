          " is centred around strange creatures called the aforementioned Nephilm whose origins are currently unknown. These creatures appeared in three separate Districts in 2036 and have caused untold amounts of destruction upon the world. As a result, a special task force called the Defence Alliance Worldwide Network (or “DAWN” for short) was established which was backed by the UN. They carefully selected four unique fighters: Eiji who has the ability to transform into Aegis Prime, a 55-metre-tall giant; Jamila Senai who pilots a giant robot with a large hand cannon; and two captured Nephilim called Megaton and Ganira who are control by two unknown operators. The story and characters have a lot of personality and the narrative greatly benefits from being fully voiced acted, with each character having their own distinct personality."
