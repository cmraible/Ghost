Sadly, a few alleged gearheads also thought the “sports car” grocery getter was cool, but now it seems the novelty of the thing has worn off. Now, GM is offering discounts on 2022 and 2023 models, according to GM Authority. How embarrassing."

But we also know automotive executives and their marketing hired guns don’t give a damn about legacy or enthusiasts at the end of the day. After all, wine moms’ husbands work two jobs to attend to their woman’s every whim."

Unsurprisingly, the trend chasers who jumped on the bandwagon have moved on, meaning GM is left offering cash incentives to move 2022 and 2023 Chevy Blazers. We’ll call this justice and a big fat “we told you so.”"

Sure, designing a real off-road rig is harder than slapping together something like this alleged Blazer, but real enthusiasts and of course the poser hangers-on would’ve rewarded GM for the effort for years to come. Instead, the automaker went for instant gratification, got it, and now is left with shame and regret. But modern GM has done this before and it will do it again."
