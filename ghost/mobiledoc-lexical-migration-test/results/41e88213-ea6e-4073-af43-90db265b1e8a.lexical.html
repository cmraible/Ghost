<p>Ever since <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> – the lightweight publishing platform – looked like <a href="https://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2013/04/ghost_funded.html">it would actually happen</a>, co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnONolan">John O’Nolan</a> has been talking about it facilitating journalism. And he’s been putting Ghost’s resources where his mouth is – several students of mine have had free <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(pro)</a> accounts for the length of their studies, and one group ran a site on it for the (now defunct) online journalism module at City.</p>
<p>Ghost is taking that commitment a whole step further, as they announced today, with <a href="https://blog.ghost.org/journalism/">Ghost for Journalism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We’ve created the very first Ghost Journalism Development program to find and work with three great new publications.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to find three fantastic new publishers to work with and help them grow their audiences throughout 2017, as we build out these features (and others) explicitly around their needs. In addition, we’ll be offering up $45,000 in Ghost(Pro) credit, along with access to our internal tools, data, and technology partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically an offer to become your hosting and technology team for a year, for free. That’s your second biggest cost – after people – out of the equation for the first year of a journalism startup. That’s <em>huge</em>.</p>
<h2 id="scaring-up-some-revenue-for-journalism">Scaring up some revenue for journalism</h2>
<p>What’s the other major problem with a journalism startup? Revenue, of course. That’s why <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2017/01/mediums-direct-shift-why-we-should-welcome-it.html">Medium is taking a step back to explore it</a> – and Ghost wants to work with its partners in this scheme to help figure out some useful models. And they’re willing to put development time behind it. The major next step in the platform’s development is around making money from your content.</p>
<p>Ghost has three priorities:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Memberships</strong>: Logged-in experiences for visitors & better data for publishers</li>
    <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Content delivered directly to readers, wherever they are</li>
    <li><strong>Payments</strong>: Integrations to allow publishers to build new revenue models</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these are direct revenue models that could potentially help support niche sites – and the future <em>is</em> niche sites, unless you have truly massive scale. I’ve been planning a switch to Ghost for a while, and this is even more of an incentive for me to just get on with it. I’ve been keen to launch a membership model for this site, providing deeper analysis for busy people in journalism, in a model not unlike that of <a href="https://stratechery.com">Ben Thompson’s Stratechery</a> – which i subscribe to and read avidly – and this has the potential to turn Ghost into a one stop shop for those sorts of business models.</p>
<p>Why is Ghost getting itself enmeshing in one of the biggest challenges for journalism in such a public way? I asked John, and this is what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>So many reasons. But really it all boils down to one core truth: No amount of features or good design for a platform matter if journalists aren’t getting paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can’t argue with that.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>By no means am I suggesting that we have the all in one solution to fixing that problem, but providing a platform which independent journalists can build on top of to easily take payments directly – is solid a prerequisite to anything else.</p>
    <p>Being able to build something like TheInformation or Stratechery is something which should be widely available, easy to set up, and free from the impending fear of a VC-backed overlord shutting it down. That’s the goal 🙂</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the aim of building something new – with new revenue models – pretty much demands that you adopt a really tight approach to costs. And if what you’re selling is content – and the intelligence that underlies it – technology’s main job is to facilitate that, not to be a competitive advantage that you spend huge sums on developing. That’s a mistake we need to stop making.</p>
<h2 id="the-sort-of-journalism-ghost-is-looking-for">The sort of journalism Ghost is looking for</h2>
<p>If you’re interested, here’s the sorts of startups they’re looking for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Local, political, social, cultural and investigative reporting</li>
    <li>Scientific, economic and philosophical analysis</li>
    <li>Journalism about journalism (ooo meta)</li>
    <li>Memberships, subscriptions & audience engagement</li>
    <li>New revenue models for journalism</li>
    <li>Use of emerging tech like chatbots, data, VR & APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t hang around though – you’ve got around a month – but it looks like people have been pretty interested in the announcement:</p>
