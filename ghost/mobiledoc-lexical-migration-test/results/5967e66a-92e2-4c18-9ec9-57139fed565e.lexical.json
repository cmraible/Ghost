Thirteen of these Lister Costins were built including twelve production examples powered by different engines - 3 by Jaguar, 8 with Chevy V8s, and a Maserati V8.

The car is believed to have won a South African Championship with driver John Love behind the wheel. In 1986, the car was found and purchased by Cedric Selzer a mechanic that previously worked for Team Lotus F1, but he has since become a restorer. Selzer  brought the car back to the UK. Not long after that, David Beckett, a veteran club driver, bought the car and have it a full restoration. Beckett raced the car through the late '80s and early '90s at historic events winning the HSCC and AMOC Championships in 1988 and 1991. It was sold again to David Clarke in the early '90s, and again to a new owner who put accomplished drivers Tony Dron and Soames Langton behind the wheel.",
