Thankfully this automobile went through a full engine restoration process which has the powertrain up and running like the mighty fighter it  was always supposed to be. In today's world of constant innovation and overwhelming modernity when it comes to automobiles, this is a wonderful example of how Engineers were able to make the best of what they had to work with in the 1970s. Somehow they figured out how to build something that would combine performance, good looks, and great gas mileage without breaking the bank.
