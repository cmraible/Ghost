<p>Each week, we partner with<em> Breaking Points</em> to review some of <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s most impactful efforts. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDJbQB2STrU">this week’s discussion</a> with Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti, David Sirota discusses how big business has successfully used all-expense-paid “law and economics” conferences to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pro-business-law-and-economics-interests-pushed-the-courts-right/">indoctrinate a generation of U.S. judges</a>, and how this influence may impact a new, landmark Supreme Court case that could hobble the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate emissions.</p>

<p>We send out the clip of these discussions once a week. You can also find <em>Breaking Points</em>’ YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDRIjKy6eZOvKtOELtTdeUA"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This collaboration adds to our partnerships with <em>Jacobin</em>, <em>Newsweek, The Guardian</em>, <em>The Hill</em>, <em>The American Prospect</em>, <em>The Intercept,</em> and <em>Earther.</em> All of these partnerships help defray the costs of doing our labor-intensive investigations, allow our work to have wider distribution and a bigger impact, and add to the movement to build an independent, non-corporate media.</p>
