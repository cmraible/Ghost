<h3 id="2-new-appearance">2. New Appearance</h3>

<h3 id="3-performance-model">3. Performance Model</h3>
<p>To beef up the lineup as well as boost sales, a new high-performance package was introduced called the R/T which stands for "Road and Track".

<h3 id="4-engines-offered">4. Engines Offered</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-hellcat-charger/">Charger</a> R/T was equipped with a 440-cubic-inch V8, but there were plenty of other options to choose from as well. Another option included the Slant 6, but it proved to be a poor seller. Other displacement engines included: 318ci, 383ci, and 426ci.</p>
<h3 id="5-production-total">5. Production Total</h3>
<p>For the '68 Charger, a healthy 96,100 units were produced. Out of that number, 17,000 of those were R/T models. The movie Bullitt may have had something to do with the large spike of old-school Mopars sold for the '68 model year.</p>
<h3 id="6-vinyl-top">6. Vinyl Top</h3>
<p>The last fact stated that 96,100 total '68 Chargers were produced. A fun fact to know is that 75 percent of those sold featured a vinyl top.</p>
<h3 id="7-engine-power">7. Engine Power</h3>
<p>In the video, the '68 Charger R/T featured is equipped with a 426-cubic-inch V8. This large-displacement engine produced a staggering 425-horsepower.</p>
<h3 id="8-transmission">8 .Transmission</h3>
<p>To shift the staggering power output from the Hemi V8 engine to the rear wheels requires a heavy-duty transmission. Dodge gave the car a Chrysler 727 TorqueFlite automatic transmission for the job.</p>
<h3 id="9-trademark-headlights">9. Trademark Headlights</h3>
<p>With the extensive redesign of the '68 model year, Dodge introduced concealed headlights that would become a trademark for the Charger.</p>
<h3 id="10-movie-mopar">10. Movie Mopar</h3>
<p>This may be an arguable fact, but the '68 Dodge Charger R/T involved in the epic car chase scene in the movie Bullitt was more talked about than the Bullitt Mustang driven by Steve McQueen, although the Mopar was driven by the bad guy. The Charger was also more powerful as it was stuffed with a larger engine, a 440-cubic-inches big block while the Mustang had a 390-cubic-inch engine. The Charger made 375-horsepower, and the Mustang had 325-hp.</p>
