<p>It is looking increasingly likely that COVID-19 will be with us forever — but that doesn’t mean we need to prepare for the end of the world. For those who have wisely embraced vaccines, COVID is on the verge of resembling just another virus. So, as argued in several of the articles that we highlight below, it may be time to weigh the risks of infection among the fully vaccinated against the costs of poorly planned policies and mounting COVID fatigue.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/briefing/when-will-covid-end.html"><strong>How Does This End?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New York Times) <em>— “The bottom line is that Covid now presents the sort of risk to most vaccinated people that we unthinkingly accept in other parts of life. And there is not going to be a day when we wake up to headlines proclaiming that COVID is defeated. In many ways, the future of the virus has arrived. All of which raises the question of which precautions should end — now or soon — and which should become permanent.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/what-americas-covid-goal-now/620572/"><strong>America Has Lost the Plot on COVID</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Atlantic) <em>— “On the ground, the U.S. is now running an uncontrolled experiment with every strategy all at once. COVID-19 policies differ wildly by state, county, university, workplace, and school district. And because of polarization, they have also settled into the most illogical pattern possible: The least vaccinated communities have some of the laxest restrictions, while highly vaccinated communities — which is to say those most protected from COVID-19 — tend to have some of the most aggressive measures aimed at driving down cases. ‘We’re sleepwalking into policy because we’re not setting goals,’ says Joseph Allen, a Harvard professor of public health. We will never get the risk of COVID-19 down to absolute zero, and we need to define a level of risk we can live with.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://theappeal.org/rikers-nyquil-theft-new-york-clemency/"><strong>A Homeless Man Has Spent 800 Days At Rikers After Stealing Cold Medicine. Now His Prison Sentence May Be Beginning</strong></a> (The Appeal) <em>— “Randolph’s case is one of many examples of New York’s continued criminalization of mental illness, substance use disorders, and poverty. As of Oct. 15, almost half of the more than 5,500 people incarcerated in the city’s jails received mental health services, according to city data. ‘Clients like Reggie have been failed by nearly every system they have touched since birth — from health care to education, housing, mental health, courts, and beyond,’ Legal Aid attorney Jeffrey Berman, a member of Randolph’s legal team, told </em>New York Focus<em> and </em>The Appeal<em> in a statement. ‘There is an opportunity to right a wrong here, and to release Reggie from the shackles of this system so he can take a step forward in his journey of healing and recovery.’”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/who-is-inflation-hurting-and-what"><strong>Who Is Inflation Hurting And What To Do About It?</strong></a> (Stay-At-Home Macro) <em>— “This CNN interview was a hot mess on many levels. They talked with a family about how much they are spending on milk. Yes, milk. It led to a Twitter meltdown. Sigh. There’s a lot to get riled up about in that clip. New organizations, please use FRED to do fact checks. My main complaint was the narrow coverage of their grocery bill. The interview totally ignored the extra income support the family is getting this year. The new Child Tax Credit for this family with nine kids totals at least $2,250 per month and adds to their $15,400 in stimulus checks in March. Together, this money must exceed the higher cost of milk and the other things they buy. Again, context.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/11/corporate-archives-lack-of-access-problems-for-historians.html"><strong>Why Companies With Long Histories Should Open Up Their Archives</strong></a> (Slate) <em>— “Firms build worlds. On this, historians and businesspeople agree. Corporations have always been among the greatest forces shaping American life. And the many corporations that hold private archives documenting their past activities have unique powers to disclose — or hide — their contributions to racial injustice in America. That’s why, if they truly want to advance the cause of social justice, companies should throw open their archives for researchers to use.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/11/democrats-fake-culture-wars-crt-republicans"><strong>America Needs Help. Yet Democrats Are Getting Sucked Into Fake Culture Wars</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Guardian) <em>— “Walk around your town. Explore a major American city. Drive across the country. What are the most important problems you see? There is poverty. Homelessness. A lack of affordable housing. Vast and jaw-dropping economic and racial inequality. There is a lack of public transportation, a broken healthcare system, environmental degradation, and a climate crisis that threatens to upend our way of life. These are real problems. These are the things that we need our government to fix. These are what we need to hear politicians talk about. These are what we must debate and focus on, if we are really concerned about human rights and our children’s future and all the other big things we claim to value.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/15/the-great-organic-food-fraud"><strong>The Great Organic-Food Fraud</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “Organic crops are those which, among other restrictions, have been grown without the application of certain herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Close scrutiny of a crop of non-organic tomatoes might reveal that they had been exposed to these treatments. But it might not. And an organic product can become accidentally tainted if proscribed chemicals carry across from a neighboring crop… The real difference, then, between a ton of organic soybeans and a ton of conventional soybeans is the story you can tell about them. The test, at the point of sale, is merely a question: Was this grown organically? That’s not like asking if a cup of coffee is decaffeinated. It’s more like buying sports memorabilia — is this really the ball? — or like trying to establish if a used car has had more than a single, careful owner.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/irish-crown-jewels-theft"><strong>The Greatest Unsolved Heist In Irish History</strong></a> (Atlas Obscura) <em>— “Four days before the king was due to arrive in Dublin, the jewels went missing. The story of this theft would eventually involve a sex scandal, conspiracies that pointed the finger at both sides of the political spectrum, the occult, drunken pranks, bankrupt celebrities, sham trials, and an incredibly effective hush campaign from the top rung of the political ladder. The jewels have never been recovered.”</em></li>
