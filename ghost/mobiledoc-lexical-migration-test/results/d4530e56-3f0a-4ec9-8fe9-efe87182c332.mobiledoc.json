          "Cloaked in the iconic Highland Green, a color made famous by Steve McQueen in Bullitt, the body of this GT500 tribute is in fantastic shape. Covering the engine bay is a fiberglass hood with dual scoops, and the front features an extended nose. Other Shelby upgrades include the scoops on the quarter panel and the trunk spoiler. Even more, iconic white Shelby stripes were painted over the top, and it was given matching decals on the rocker panels. Further adding to the Shelby attitude is the driving lights embedded in the grille, Cobra badges, and correct-style 15-inch wheels that sit on all four corners. Black vinyl in excellent shape protects the roof."

Even more, the engine is adorned with Cobra ribbed valve covers and a matching long air topper. Providing additional oomph and rumble is the glasspack-style dual exhaust that plays in symphony with the small block. Navigating the turns comes easy thanks to power steering."
