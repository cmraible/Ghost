Copart, a salvage yard auction company, has yielded many interesting finds over the years, and their collection of C8s does not disappoint. At the time of writing this story, Copart currently has 4 wrecked C8s in their inventory, and they’re actually pulling in some decent bids."

          " is ending soon, and has an estimated retail value of $110,502. It has just a hair over 3,500 miles on it, and seems to be in fine condition from the fenders back. Without paying a couple hundred bucks to find out for sure, we think the price driver means this Vette is equipped with the Z51 Performante package. The bid is currently in the $60Ks, a far cry from the estimate, but it could jump pretty quickly when the auction is closer to ending."

Copart has it listed as having “biohazard/chemical” damage, and the interior looks just as trashed as the rest of the car. The current bid is $3,400, which could end up being the most expensive passenger side headlight assembly anyone will ever buy."
