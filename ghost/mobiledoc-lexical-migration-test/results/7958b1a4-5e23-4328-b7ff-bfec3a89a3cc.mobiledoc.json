Proceeds from the event benefitted Tennessee Baptist Children’s Home in Brentwood, which serves 250 children and teens in the state through foster care as well as three residential locations. More specifically, the Kars4Kids program raises money for summer activities and programs for youth residents at the Brentwood home. The show was held at Elks Lodge 72 in Franklin."
