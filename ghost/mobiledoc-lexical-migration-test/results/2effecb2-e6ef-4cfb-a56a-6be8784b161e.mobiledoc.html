<p>In place of the Fairlane's original inline-six engine and three-speed manual gearbox, this car is packing a 460 cubic-inch V8 circa 1972 paired to a three-speed automatic transmission. To give this powertrain a modern flair, the engine has been upgraded with electronic fuel injection and upgraded MSD ignition, while the transmission gets a B&M ratchet shifter. An aluminum radiator, power steering and power disc front brakes ensures this Ford is ready to cruise anywhere, while the dressed up engine compartment means this car is ready to show.</p>
<p>While the stock powertrain is long gone, this car still like it did when it rolled off the assembly line back in 1958. That's thanks to the Raven Black over Colonial White paint scheme that matches the original paint codes on the trim tag, although the 15-inch American Racing wheels  – about the only visual cue that this car isn't bone stock. Likewise, the interior has been kept close to stock with the two-tone cloth seating, and even the aftermarket stereo has been mounted in the glove box to keep the cabin looking factory fresh. The only noticeable mods made inside the cabin are auxiliary gauges under the dash and the ratchet shifter.</p>
<p>This gorgeous 1958 Ford Fairlane restomod packs cool style and cruise-ready performance, and it's being listed for $26,900. Contact Showdown Auto for more information on this vintage Ford or any of the other classic and collectible cars the Detroit-area dealership has up for sale.</p>
