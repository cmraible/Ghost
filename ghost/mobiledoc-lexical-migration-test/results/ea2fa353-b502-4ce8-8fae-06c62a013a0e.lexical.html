<p>President Joe Biden has pledged to address environmental and racial justice issues in marginalized communities by backing programs to reconnect minority communities split apart by highway projects and to replace large amounts of lead pipes, among other initiatives. But over the summer, Biden quietly agreed to slash funding for such efforts, and Democrats accepted the move without complaint.</p>

<p>“One of the biggest scams in the history of forever.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/amyhanauer/status/1432724425716142082?s=20">Former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp</a> talking last April about the stepped-up tax basis rule, a loophole that allows heirs to inherit investment assets without paying any capital gains taxes.</p>
<p>Heitkamp is now the chair of a dark money group, Saving America’s Family Enterprises (SAFE), which is lobbying against efforts to repeal the stepped-up basis. According to a<a href="https://doubledeathtax.org/heidi-heitkamp-launches-saving-americas-family-enterprises-safe/"> press release</a> last week, the newly launched group will run a six-figure media campaign to attempt to preserve the tax loophole. (<em>The American Prospect</em><a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/building-back-america/infrastructure-summer-heidi-heitkamps-lobbying-journey/">has more</a> on Heitkamp and stepped-up.)</p>

<p>The five largest military contractors in America received $2 trillion in public dollars from Congress over the course of the war in Afghanistan, <a href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/the-top-5-military-contractors-ate">according to an analysis</a> from Stephen Semler of the Security Policy Reform Institute.</p>

<p>When Biden <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2021/06/30/biden-says-no-double-dipping-on-infrastructure/">pledged</a> in June that any program that received funding in the bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill would not be included in Democrats’ reconciliation bill, the party <a href="http://www.hillheat.com/articles/2021/08/31/with-no-double-dip-deal-biden-has-quietly-acquiesced-to-enormous-climate-justice-cuts-in-infrastructure-plans">quietly acquiesced</a> to the arrangement — meaning <a href="http://www.hillheat.com/articles/2021/08/31/with-no-double-dip-deal-biden-has-quietly-acquiesced-to-enormous-climate-justice-cuts-in-infrastructure-plans">they signed off on massive cuts</a> to vital environmental justice initiatives.</p>

<p>A century ago, the largest labor uprising in United States history took place in the coal fields of West Virginia. Nearly 10,000 miners battled strikebreakers, local law enforcement, and the U.S. military, resulting in nearly 100 deaths. Read <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/blair-mountain-coal-union-anniversary/">this dispatch</a> in <em>The Nation </em>about the battle and what it means for labor politics today.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>PURDUE PHARMA PRESSURES DOJ NOT TO APPEAL SETTLEMENT: </strong>Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, has undertaken a stealth operation to stop the Department of Justice (DOJ) from appealing its bankruptcy settlement, which protects the Sackler family and their associates from legal liability for the opioid crisis. “We collectively speak for the overwhelming majority of the state and local governments, organizations, and individuals harmed by Purdue and the Sacklers,” noted the company in a letter urging the DOJ to accept the settlement, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/31/1032778376/purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-doj-justice-department-sackler-oxycontin-opioid">according to a copy obtained by NPR</a>. The letter, which was sent to groups supportive of the bankruptcy arrangement, did not disclose Purdue’s role in organizing the appeal.</li>
    <li><strong>BENEFITS CLIFF LOOMS: </strong>Biden’s American Rescue Plan, the COVID-19 relief package passed in March, temporarily expanded the country’s social safety net in ways that were incredibly <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/2021-poverty-projections-assessing-impact-benefits-and-stimulus-measures/view/full_report">effective</a> — and reflected the success of progressives in rejecting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-american-rescue-plans-money-cannon/">decades of austerity politics</a>. But now, millions<strong></strong>of Americans are staring down a financial cliff as those benefits are set to end. The first cliff will arrive on Labor Day, when <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/7-5-million-workers-face-devastating-unemployment-benefits-cliff-labor-day/?session=1&session=1">7.5 million people</a> will lose federal unemployment benefits, a loss that will <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/07/27/in-41-days-20-million-americans-will-lose-ui-benefits/">affect 20 million</a> Americans, including dependents of people receiving the aid. This the <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/7-5-million-workers-face-devastating-unemployment-benefits-cliff-labor-day/?session=1&session=1">largest such benefit cutoff </a>in recent history — and with the nation struggling through a resurgent pandemic, many say it’s far too early for the program to end.</li>
    <li><strong>FOSSIL FUEL INTERESTS TWEET THROUGH FOSSIL-FUEL-CREATED DISASTER: </strong>As Hurricane Ida, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163470/hurricane-ida-climate-change-oil-industry">powered by</a> the burning of fossil fuels, pummeled the United States, the fossil fuel industry took to Twitter. ExxonMobil, the company that <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming/">invested in climate change research</a> in the 1970s and then <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/ending-the-climate-crisis/exxon-and-the-oil-industry-knew-about-climate-change/exxons-climate-denial-history-a-timeline/">spearheaded efforts</a> to block solutions, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hey-exxon-maybe-stop-tweeting-1847592820">tweeted "thoughts and prayers"</a> for survivors of Hurricane Ida. The American Petroleum Institute, the trade association for oil companies, didn’t even attempt to greenwash: One day after Hurricane Ida made landfall, <a href="https://twitter.com/APIenergy/status/1432360973361459200?s=20">the group tweeted</a> an appeal for the Biden administration to approve new oil and gas drilling permits.</li>
    <li><strong>ABORTION RIGHTS UNDER ATTACK:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court allowed a radical anti-abortion law to take effect early Wednesday morning. The move meant a Texas law passed earlier this year now "effectively bans abortion at six weeks, a time at which many people don't realize they're pregnant," <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/scotus-allows-texas-abortion-ban-sb-8_n_612e6044e4b04778bffd6f1f"><em>HuffPost </em>writes</a>. The law deputizes Texas citizens to sue anyone helping people obtain abortions, with a potential $10,000 reward for those who bring about successful suits. <br></li>
