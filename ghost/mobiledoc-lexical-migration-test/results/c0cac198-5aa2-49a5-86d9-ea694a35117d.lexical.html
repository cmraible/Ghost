<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Last week, we offered <strong>one of our biggest deals ever, </strong>so as many people as possible could score a copy of our important new e-book: <em>John Roberts’ Revolution.</em></p>
<p>The effort was so successful, we decided to open up the discount for one more day: <a href="https://bit.ly/3RxzInR"><strong>Click here</strong></a><strong></strong>or use the button below to get a <strong>full year of membership to <em>The Lever</em> for only $4 per month</strong>.</p>

<p>As soon as you subscribe, you will get access to <em>John Roberts’ Revolution, </em>our 135-page e-book in which we reveal point by point how a court led by a celebrated “moderate” like John Roberts has become the most extreme in a century — and explore what can be done to stop it.</p>

<p>This e-book weaves together years of original reporting and new expert Q&As to explore the far-reaching jurisprudential revolution that is laying waste to America. It is a critical resource as we watch the current judicial coup unfold.</p>
<p>Once you take this special deal, you’ll be sent an email with access to <strong>both</strong> of our e-books: <em>John Roberts’ Revolution</em> and our <em>Citizens’ Guide to Following the Money and Holding the Powerful Accountable</em>. You can download and read them at your convenience or read them on the e-reader of your choice — plus you’ll have immediate access as we release more e-books.</p>
<p>You’ll also get access to all sorts of supporting subscriber-only benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access to exclusive content like <em>Left Wondering</em>, <em>Cheat Sheet</em>, <em>You Love To See It</em>, and <em>Lever Weekly</em>.</li>
    <li>A subscription to our extended weekly podcast <em>Lever Time Premium</em>.</li>
    <li>Full commenting privileges on articles and chat threads.</li>
    <li>Invitations to special member-only monthly <em>Lever Live</em> chats with <em>The Lever</em>’s editorial team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, for a very limited time, you can get full membership, including these books, for only <a href="https://bit.ly/3RxzInR"><strong>$4 per month</strong></a>. That’s less than you’d pay for two books on their own, and you get all sorts of other exclusive content, too.</p>
