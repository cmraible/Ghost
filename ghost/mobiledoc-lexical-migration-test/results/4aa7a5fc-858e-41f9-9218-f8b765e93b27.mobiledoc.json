The best part though is the exhaust notes this engine makes from those chrome, vertical stacks when it's fired up. The engine is backed by a strong Ford C4 three-speed automatic transmission making this truck perfect for cruising car shows or tearing up trails."

Getting into the truck is easy thanks to the tube side steps, and opening the doors to the cab reveals that this truck still has a mostly stock interior with the exception of an aftermarket stereo system, four-spoke Challenger Series steering wheel from Grant and billet shift levers for the transmission and transfer case. Like the body, this cabin is in great shape with no wear or stains on the cloth seats and no cracks or fading on the dash."
