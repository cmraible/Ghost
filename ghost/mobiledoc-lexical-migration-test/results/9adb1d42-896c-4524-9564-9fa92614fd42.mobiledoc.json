It served as an all-purpose vehicle for carrying small groups of soldiers over treacherous terrain. Climbing rocks, driving through the mud and handling lots of bouncing around while still keeping on the straight and narrow path. Initially produced in 1941, Jeep quickly carved out a piece of the American automotive industry as the military's front-line manufacturer in tactical vehicles. These great utility vehicles made crossing rough terrain far less difficult for the soldiers whose lives depended on their reliability and ability to get the job done."

GM has been particularly influential in Sport Utility vehicles, especially with the GMC Suburban, which initially boasted an exceptionally high carrying capacity and stylish design for the time. This means that many GM fanatics regard these SUVs as their dream ride and would jump at the opportunity to own one of these great cars. So what if you want to obtain one for yourself?"
