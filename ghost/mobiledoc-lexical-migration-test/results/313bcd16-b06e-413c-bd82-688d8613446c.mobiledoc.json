The paint looks great and the Dark Gold vinyl top isn’t splitting, cracking, or fading, which is a huge plus for a car this age. All the body panels are straight and don’t have obvious damage, showing careful use over the past 49 years. Just as amazing is the factory interior, which doesn’t show any major signs of wear. In fact, the front and rear seats almost look as if nobody has sat in them."
