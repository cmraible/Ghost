This example (chassis 417885) won its very race at the 1988 Rallye de Portugal, and the Delta HF Integrale 8V went on to win a dominating 11 WRC rounds that year. This car was sold after just one year of factory racing, but it kept performing well through the 1990 WRC season. In its retirement, this Lancia was fully restored and it was displayed at the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance in 2017 and The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering the following year.",
