It certainly doesn’t look like it had a cover over it, even though the barn provided some shelter from the elements, because the paint has some imperfections. Call it some character over time or patina, many people these days pay handsomely for that kind of effect."

Keeping with that theme is the red upholstery, carpeting, and dash. Original details are visible everywhere. The seller states there’s a Dewitts radiator, new wiring harness, new front disc brakes, new Bilstein shocks, new top, new upholstery, new radio, and vintage air which still blows cold. Powering this ride is a brand new small block V8 fashioned to look period-correct, while a manual four-speed backs it up."
