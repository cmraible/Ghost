And while the worst is the loss of life, it’s still awful to see homes and livelihoods ruined by nature. There’s a mixture of the two for popular car YouTuber Adam LZ whose Florida compound where he lives, works, and stores his collection of cars flooded."

Even though his property, according to him, basically sits at sea level, the ponds and low-lying areas were doing a sufficient job capturing and managing the excess water. Well, there was the issue of the front gate to the property being essentially cut off by several feet of water. Oh, and the potential for alligators in all the water on the compound sounded like fun. But at least the cars and his house were safe."

However, Adam LZ didn’t seem too concerned since he and his team elevated the most valuable vehicles and items. Sure, some rollers and parts cars sitting out in the open were probably getting soaked, but his many other impressive vehicles were safe and dry."

Normally, people assume a nice blue sky means the risk is over, but instead the worst of it was to come thanks to flooding up north triggering a surge of water in his area."
