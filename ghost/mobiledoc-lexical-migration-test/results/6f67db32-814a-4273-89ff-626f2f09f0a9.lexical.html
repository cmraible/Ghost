<p>When it comes to the best designed automobiles, pre-war cars are always at the top of the conversation, and the Cord 810/812 lineup is an excellent example. Although this car was only offered for two model years (as the 1936 810 and 1937 812), it was at the cutting edge of vehicle design, and this gorgeous <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-HZOD5/1937-cord-812">1937 Cord 812</a> would make the perfect addition to an elegant collection as it is currently up for grabs through the Classic Car Club of America's <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/auctions/4-FVZBB/ccca-full-classics-online-auction">Full Classics Online Auction</a>.</p>

<p>Following a detailed restoration in the 1990s, this Cord 812 survives today in its factory-correct shade of cream exterior paint called Cigarette Cream with an Oxblood Red leather interior that is absolutely elegant. Despite the restoration being as old as a classic itself, this vintage beauty still shows incredibly well and is a stunning example American automotive design. The highlight of the Cord 810 and 812 is definitely its timeless design consisting of the instantly recognizable coffin nose styling with a wraparound grille and the massive round fenders with hidden headlights, but everywhere you look on this car, there are intricate details that catch the eye.</p>
<p>In addition to its artistic body design, the Cord 810 and 812 are known for their front-wheel drive configuration. Under that long, coffin-shaped hood is a 289 cubic-inch V8 paired to a four-speed transmission, and the engine compartment of this Cord is as show-worthy as every other aspect of this beautiful convertible. Top up or down, 1937 Cord 812 is absolutely artwork in motion!</p>
<p>This fully restored <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-HZOD5/1937-cord-812">1937 Cord 812</a> is ready for anything from a concours d'elegance to a CCCA Grand Classic or CAN-AM CARavan, and bidding will be available until June 16. <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/login">Register to bid</a> on this Cord 812 or any of the other elegant vintage cars that are up for auction. </p>
