That’s definitely the case with this Pro-Touring 1969 Chevrolet Camaro LS. This muscle car has been modified six ways to Sunday and is nowhere near what it was when new. Plus, it looks fantastic, making this Chevy the package deal."

Backing that up is a Tremec T56 Magnum 6-speed manual transmission and a McLeod hydraulic clutch. To handle that kind of power this Chevrolet Camaro now wears a Strange 9-inch rear axle with a Posi-traction differential and 4.10 gears."

Power locks and windows are another great convenience. A custom leather interior is pretty plush, plus the trunk is lined with leather as well, for good measure."
