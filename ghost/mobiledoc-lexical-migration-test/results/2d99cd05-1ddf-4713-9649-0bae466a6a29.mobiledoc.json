Instead of whining about the lemons given to them by NASCAR, these guys took the bull by the horns and found a way to keep squeezing value of the car. In the process, they made even more of a name for themselves."

Of course, while Bobby Isaac and Harry Hyde were the ones literally risking life and limb pushing the Dodge Daytona to its limits, there was a whole crew there making this miraculous attempt a reality. It’s a great story and definitely worth the 16 some-odd minutes of your time, so check it out."
