<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-target-dealership/">dealership</a> located in Rolling Meadows, Illinois was burglarized in the early morning hours of August 4, the criminals getting away with a Dodge Hellcat and a 2017 Jaguar F-Pace. This is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-c7-corvette-z06/">shocking trend</a> we’ve been monitoring since last year, with thieves deciding to hit dealerships <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-durango-hellcats/">in the middle of the night</a>, often getting away with multiple cars since nobody is there to stop them.</p>

<p>We know, we know, everyone is super, duper shocked to hear some cars were stolen in the Chicago Metropolitan Area since <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-delivery-driver-attacked/">crime is like really rare there</a>.  The dealership in question is called Exotic Motors, a name which probably drew the criminals’ attention, sadly.</p>
<p>According to a local report, two men drove a vehicle of some sort (they seriously don’t say what it was) through an “overhead door” (like a garage door they have at the service bay) to gain entrance to the dealership.</p>

<p>Once they were able to get inside using the one vehicle as a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-stealing-economy-cars/">battering ram</a>, the genius thieves selected the Hellcat and Jag. There are no details about how they took the two cars, but it’s likely they were able to break into whatever was used to store the keys for all the vehicles at the dealership.</p>
<p>Police believe the two stolen cars were likely damaged by the broken door, because these two thieves are like super smart and thought of everything. What’s truly troubling is the local report says there was no description of the two suspects or info about the vehicle used to break down the door.</p>
<p>As stated before, dealerships have become popular targets for car thieves, but so have private residences. Many criminals prefer to work under the cover of darkness, making it vital to secure your rides each night. If you can park in a garage, do. Using aftermarket security devices can help make your vehicle harder to steal, which might encourage genius thieves like these two to move on to something else.</p>
