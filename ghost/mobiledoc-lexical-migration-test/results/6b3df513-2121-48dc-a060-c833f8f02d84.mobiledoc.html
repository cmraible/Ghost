<p>The automobile in question is a white 1967 Chevrolet Nova, a real collectors car in the automotive industry. Without a doubt, it was a valuable car but vehicles like this usually mean a lot more to the driver than could ever be expressed by a blank check. It was taken from the owners property, and a patch of land spanning about three acres which everyone in town referred to as the farm. It seems the area might have been just a bit too well known.</p>
<p>It’s actually really unclear at this point as to how the thieves managed to pull off such an elaborate heist. The Nova was apparently built to be a pretty fast car, or at least the sound that way. So the owners definitely would’ve heard had the thieves driven off with it, this leads the family to think they trailer did away. Needless to say the car‘s owner and his family are pretty devastated by this whole event and it’s a sad sight for car people everywhere. Hopefully, the Nova will be recovered someday and the man behind the wheel will have his justice.</p>
