We established a base within this outback reserve, collected resources and we even had warring feuds with other kids who established their own bases. It was a time of my life that seemed like it would never end, that was until my brother got a bit older and no longer wanted to play with me. It's an oddly unique feeling looking back on it today with a mix of nostalgia and self pity, but this is the "

But here, there is no health bar; there are no enemies aside from cardboard cut-outs of imaginary monsters; the adventure is as grand as the imagination of a child's mind (limitless). Your primary objective (in order to impress your sister) is to be the legendary hero and help every anthropomorphic character with their (re)quests in the hope that they'll join your town base. For example, one kid atop a waterfall wants you to take arms as cardboard slime enemies storm the \"base\"; or another wants you to talk to a bull who's been standing on a dock for a long time contemplating whether or not to jump into a lake because \"there is no such thing as a floofy bull\". It's exactly the nonsensical hilarity you'd expect to come from a child's mouth who has perhaps drunk a little too much red cordial."

As a younger sibling, it could be that I can relate to the game's plot personally; I know that my brother didn't stop playing with me because he didn't like me anymore, he just grew up to face life's challenges and after a few years, so did I.
