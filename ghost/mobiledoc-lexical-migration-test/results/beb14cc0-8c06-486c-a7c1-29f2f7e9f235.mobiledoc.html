<p>When you’re a globally-recognized <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">basketball superstar</a>, along with the fame comes <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/googled-celebrity-collections/">plenty of money</a>. If you’re a car guy in the least, that means you can make all your <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/musicians-car-collection/">wildest automotive dreams</a> come true. That certainly seems to be the case with LeBron James, who has a car collection worth well over $1 million.</p>
<p>The man doesn’t just collect expensive supercars and luxury sedans. He likes to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">personalize</a> many of his vehicles, making them truly unique.</p>
<p><strong>Chevrolet Camaro SS</strong></p>

<p>A perfect example of King James buying a rather <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/robert-herjavec-really-loves-cars/">affordable yet fun</a> vehicle and making it his is the Camaro SS in his collection. Instead of just leaving it completely stock, the man had larger white wheels fitted to the muscle car, matching the pristine body. You’ll notice other trim pieces have been painted white to match, while the Chevrolet bowtie on the front grille is black to really make it pop.</p>
<p><strong>1957 Chevrolet Impala</strong></p>

<p>LeBron has indicated many times that the most valued car in his collection is a 1957 Chevrolet Impala. We can respect that the man has a soft spot for the classics. Rather than just leaving the car stock, when he had it restored, the convertible was gained a flashy purple paint job with white accents. It rides on bigger wheels with purple accents and low-profile tires are wrapped around for a statement you can’t help but notice.</p>
<p><strong>Ferrari 458 Spider</strong></p>

<p>Just about everyone loves a red <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ferrari-banned-celebrities/">Ferrari</a>convertible, including King James. While this Italian stallion is flashy, it backs up those brash looks with a 4.5-liter V8 pumping 570-horsepower, helping it move in a hurry when needed. Even with all that performance, the vehicle won’t let the basketball player drive around unnoticed, because Ferraris always draw plenty of attention.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini Aventador Roadster</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---4--2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Motorious---4--2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Motorious---4--2.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Motorious---4--2.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---4--2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>Even more of a standout than his Ferrari, James’ Lamborghini Aventador Roadster features one wild paint job. These cars are brash with the sharp angular aesthetics, but Nike wanted to do something special for one of its biggest spokesmen by commissioning Lou La Vie, an exotic car rental company, to make the Aventador match the basketball player’s special Kings Pride floral shoes. Everyone knows this supercar belongs to LeBron, which is the whole point. This Lambo is valued at $670,000, making it one of the most expensive the NBA player owns.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Maybach S650</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---5--3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Motorious---5--3.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Motorious---5--3.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Motorious---5--3.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---5--3.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>While not as flashy as his supercars, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/pierce-brosnan-car-collection/">ultra-luxury sedan</a> is still quite impressive. The base price of one of these Mercedes-Maybach s650s is $240,500, but it looks like James has quite a few bespoke options added to his, so the actual cost had to be much higher. The man is often chauferred in this car, which features incredibly plush rear seats with extendable footrests and many other plus amenities.</p>
<p><strong>Bentley Continental GT</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---2--3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Motorious---2--3.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Motorious---2--3.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Motorious---2--3.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---2--3.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>This British grand tourer is about a mix of extreme luxury and solid performance, which is why some believe it provides the best of both worlds. We’re thinking LeBron likely was drawn to this Bentley for those same reasons, plus the man is very much into aesthetics and there’s no denying that this is a one fine-looking car.</p>
<p><strong>Kia K900</strong></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---6--3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Motorious---6--3.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Motorious---6--3.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Motorious---6--3.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/Motorious---6--3.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>A few years ago LeBron James shocked many when he was announced as the official spokesman of the Kia K900 luxury sedan. After all, the man is loaded and certainly didn’t need the endorsement, which in the minds of many would be the only reason for his pushing the Korean brand. The truth is King James was already driving a K900 before Kia contacted him about the endorsement. It’s not only a big sedan, many who have given it an honest shot have been shocked at how refined and comfortable it is. LeBron’s endorsement helped build awareness, but we don’t expect the K900 to now be seen more favorably than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7 Series anytime soon.</p>
