<p>Good things are happening! For starters, Biden is less militaristic than many expected. A controversial pipeline project has been defeated in Oregon. In New York, meanwhile, regulators are starting to take climate risk seriously, while the state attorney general is carrying on the good fight against Amazon. Finally, the Pentagon has enlisted nuclear-disarmament advocates to study alternatives to its longstanding intercontinental ballistic missiles system.</p>

Mayor Todd Gloria says the policy aligns city investments with city values and will boost progress on San Diego’s climate action goals by not providing financial support to corporations that increase greenhouse gas emissions.”</em></p>
