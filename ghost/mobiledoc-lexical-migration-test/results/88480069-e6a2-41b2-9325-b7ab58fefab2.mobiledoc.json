Aside from a dose of cynicism — the only incentive to move seems to be the fear of PR damage — , Facebook’s numbness is rooted in its insularity. Mark Zuckerberg has yet to understand that you don’t fight global misinformation from the shores of the San Francisco Bay. As demonstrated by a New York Times [investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/world/facebook-moderators-takeaways.html), Facebook is unable to think beyond its hyper-centralized system when it comes to fighting the junk that litters its pages"

Like most of the big platforms, Facebooks wants all the advantages of scale without the problems. As reporting has shown over the last year, the nature, characteristics and spread of disinformation and propaganda very wildly worldwide, and algorithmic solutions coded up by  non-diverse workforce in one of the richest parts of the world are not really going to cut it."
