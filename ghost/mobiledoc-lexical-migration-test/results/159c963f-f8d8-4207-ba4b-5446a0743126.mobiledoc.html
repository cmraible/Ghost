<p>Back in the late '60s, Pontiac introduced a new sports car to the lineup and called it the Firebird.  Originally, Pontiac wanted to create a two-seater car based on their Banshee concept car, but GM feared that it would take sales away from the ever-popular Chevrolet Corvette. The solution was to introduce the Firebird into the pony car market and have it share the F-body platform and much of its sheet metal with its cousin, the Camaro. Of course, the Firebird was given a look and identity all its own. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Classic+Cars+of+Sarasota">Classic Cars of Sarasota</a> is excited to offer the opportunity to add this stunning first-generation <a href="https://www.classiccarsofsarasota.com/vehicles/533/1967-pontiac-firebird-400?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1967 Pontiac Firebird 400 convertible</a> to your garage.</p>

<p>Shining brightly in its factory hue of Montego Cream, the body of this '67 Firebird shows in excellent shape including the paint and chrome accents. Unlike the Camaro, the Firebird's front bumper is integrated into the front end's overall design, and it featured slit-style taillights that were inspired by the '66-'67 Pontiac GTO. Protecting the cabin is a new white convertible top. A set of PMD wheels sit on all four corners.</p>
<p>Tucked under the hood of this 'Bird is a numbers-correct 400cui V8 engine mated to a Muncie 4-speed transmission that sends power down to the rear wheels. Open the doors or drop the top to an immaculate original black interior complete with bucket seats  that perfectly complements its light exterior. Even the undercarriage of this vintage Pontiac is free of rust.</p>
