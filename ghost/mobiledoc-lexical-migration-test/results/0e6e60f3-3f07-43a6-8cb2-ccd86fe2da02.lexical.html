<p>"<a href="https://www.audrainautomuseum.org/landyachts" rel="noreferrer">Land Yachts, Cruising the Interstate Highways</a>,” the latest Audrain Automobile Museum exhibit, which opens on Saturday, June 4<sup>th, </sup>invites automotive enthusiasts to travel back in time to when land yachts ruled the highways and the byways. The exhibit runs from June 4<sup>th</sup> through September 4<sup>th</sup> and will feature cars as large and in charge as the motor yachts that grace the historic Newport harbor during the summer season.</p>
<p>On display in the museum’s intimate gallery will be 14 of the finest and best-known examples of “Land Yachts,” created between 1948 and 1970.</p>
<p>No exhibit on “Land Yachts” would be complete without a 1948 Hudson Commodore Eight. The Commodore was the largest and most luxurious model produced by Hudson at the time. Though the production period was paused from January 1942 through August 1945 due to the War, an all-new aerodynamic design was introduced for 1948, representing one of the first newly designed postwar automobiles when the hunger for new cars was hotter than ever. This example has covered just 27,000 miles since 1948 and has won a first-place award in every car show it has been entered in.</p>

<p>The epitome of 1950’s style and status were never more evident than in the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz, the most elegant Caddy you could buy. While most Cadillacs touted the best craftsmanship offered in a General Motors vehicle in the 1950s and appealed to more conservative wealthy buyers, the stylish flagship Eldorado 2-door model convertible was re-badged the Biarritz, named after the elegant seaside town on the coast of France. Itshardtop counterpart became the Eldorado Seville. The Biarritz was a huge hit with the rich and famous who wished to see and be seen in this elegant car.</p>
<p>In the 1960’s “Land Yachts” also ushered in the era of muscle cars. The 1955 Chrysler 300 hardtop was considered by many as the first real muscle car, with its famous 331 <a href="http://cu.in/" rel="noreferrer">cu.in</a>. Hemi V-8. Designer Virgil Exner with Head Engineer Bob Rogers' “Forward Look” hit its stride in 1957, with the Chrysler's egg-crate grille and four headlights body lines led back to huge fins and cathedral window taillights. The 1961 Chrysler 300G would be the last iconic “big fin” car in the Chrysler "letter-car" series having been inspired by the 1955 Ghia Gilda concept car. A pricey $5800 limited production with the front heavily modified to accept four angled headlights framing an egg-crate grille with body lines heading back to huge fins and cathedral window taillights. Sales climbed to 1,280 300G hardtops and 337 convertibles being produced in 1961.</p>

<p>The 1970 Plymouth Superbird 2-door was both a large car and one of the most powerful to ever to take to the streets. The Plymouth Road Runner Superbird along with its sister car, the Dodge Charger Daytona, showcased the design that changed NASCAR forever. With its extended nose cone and massive rear wing, the car was much faster and more capable than all competitors in 1970 and was the first NASCAR to surpass the 200 MPH barrier. The Road Runner Superbirdlives on today as perhaps the most iconic muscle car of all time, and the car that changed NASCAR forever. While it was dominant on the racetrack, it carried a friendly persona off the track. The Road Runner cartoon was included in multiple places on the car, giving the car a friendly charm. The car also includes a horn that resembles the cartoon’s ‘meep meep’ sound. The overall design was seen as extreme by many enthusiasts, and was clearly designed to compete on the NASCAR circuit.</p>

<p>“Many of the cars in the exhibition are among the largest of all time and brilliantly communicate the postwar confidence and booming economy of the USA in the 25 years following World War II,” said Donald Osborne, Audrain’s CEO. “These iconic vehicles are a fascinating look back at a time when the engineering and design philosophy of American companies was to build vehicles to take full advantage of the newly created smooth roads across the United States. We invite you to travel back in time to when land yachts ruled the roads.”</p>
