After graduation from the University of Pisa in 1953, he started working for Alfa Romeo and helped with development for the Giulietta. However, he gravitated to the company’s far more experimental ventures, earning quite the reputation."

As chief engineer for the fledgling automaker, he’s credited for much of the work in creating the 250 GTO, perhaps the most revered Ferrari ever. Legend has it Bizzarrini lent his own 250 GT as a guinea pig for development in the quest to turn out a true track threat."

The man was persuaded to come onboard and of course developed a vicious V12 engine which was first used in the 350 GT. Used in different models in one form or another until the Murcielago, including mid-ship in the Miura, Bizzarrini’s creation strongly shaped the tone of Lamborghinis for decades."
