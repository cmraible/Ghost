<hr>
<p>If anything good has come from the COVID-19 shutdowns, it's the expanded use of online car auctions to make bidding on your favorite classic even easier, but what you gain in convenience you lose in being able to experience the action in person and see the cars up close and personal. For those who have been missing physical car auctions, there's good news: GAA Classic Cars' upcoming July auction event will be host the <em>first</em> major physical auction since the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance back in early March!</p>
<p>To ensure the safety of employees and attendees, the GAA Classic Cars auction will be following CDC guidelines including temperature checks for everyone upon arrival, face masks will be handed out to everyone in attendance, social distancing of at least six feet will be required and hand sanitizers will be available throughout the venue. The only major change from previous auctions, though, is that no spectators are permitted â€“ registered bidders and consignors only.</p>
<p>Of course, this auction will also take bids from the telephone and online, and the lots are already shaping up to be extremely unique. A rare, late-model gem is this 2020 Chevrolet Camaro that was just one of 200 created in a partnership between Hertz Car Rental and Hendrick Motorsports, while classic car lovers have vehicles like this 1941 Dodge Command Car restomod to drool over. If you're looking for something more in the middle, there are options there as well including this Ferrari Daytona replica based on a C3 Corvette.</p>
<p>The GAA Classic Car Auctions will be held July 23-25 in Greensboro, North Carolina, so regardless of whether you'll be there in person, over the phone or online, make sure you're registered to bid if you want a shot at owning any of these classic and collectible vehicles.</p>
