<p>This year has been an interesting one thus far, and it's only mid-March. COVID-19, or the Coronavirus, is sweeping the nation and has people confined to their homes in attempts to stop it from spreading even more. This virus, which all started from a nice, healthy bowl of bat soup, has sent people into a widespread panic which has made toilet paper rather hard to come by. Not only that, this pandemic has sent entire cities into lockdown, cancelled events far and wide, left a sports void, left countless people without employment, and has shut down our favorite restaurants and bars until further notice. Since the world as we know it is in confinement for the next few weeks, we wanted to bring you a list of well-known and lesser-known car movies to help you pass the time.</p>
<p><strong>Bullitt - 1968</strong></p>
<p>Of course <em>Bullitt</em> the first movie on the list as it is arguably one of the best car movies of all time. Steve McQueen plays a hard San Francisco cop and goes on the hunt for an underworld kingpin that killed a witness in his protection. Who else can't resist the epic car chase involving the 1968 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-miles/">Bullitt Mustang</a> and '<a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/176749/1968-dodge-charger-r-t">68 Dodge Charger</a> through the hilly streets of San Francisco? </p>
