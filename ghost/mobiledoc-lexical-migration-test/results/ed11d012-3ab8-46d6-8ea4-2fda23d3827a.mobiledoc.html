<p>When you subscribe to <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you get all of our podcasts, live events, and exclusive content, and you get our new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizens-guide-to-holding-the-powerful-accountable/"><em>Citizens’ Guide To Holding The Powerful Accountable</em></a>. And you directly fund our journalism that powerful politicians and corporations hate — because they hate being held accountable.<br></p>
<p>The past two weeks give you a good example of what you get as a paying subscriber. </p>
<p>We had a great <a href="__GHOST_URL__/podcast-elite-groupthink-and-the-lab-leak-theory/">podcast with Thomas Frank</a>, we had an amazing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dennis-kucinich-live-chat-on-6-23/">live event with Dennis Kucinich</a>, we broke open a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-business-is-coming-out-against-nina-turner/">huge story in Nina Turner’s congressional race</a>, and we published two major investigative reports — one on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/nothing-is-more-important-than-you-paying-them/">politicians colluding with predatory debt collectors</a>, another on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/theyve-been-doing-it-forever/">rapacious health insurance industry</a>.<br></p>
<p><strong>We are a reader-supported independent media outlet, which means none of this kind of journalism is possible without YOUR help. We have proven we can be successful and make a big impact — but the only way we can keep doing this work is with YOUR help.</strong><br></p>
<p>So please, <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0"><strong>click here RIGHT NOW to use this special discount</strong></a> and help us hire more journalists ASAP. </p>

<p>Together, we can continue challenging power and build a media outlet that is far better than corporate media. But we can only do it with your help.<br></p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
