<p>Restoring any car can be a time-consuming adventure, but restoring a rare, vintage Ferrari can take years. Three years to be exact if you want an award-winning restoration from <a href="https://farlandcars.com/">Farland Classic Restoration</a> on a <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1960-ferrari-250gt-pf-cabriolet-s2?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1960 Ferrari 250GT Cabriolet</a>.

<p>During the <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1960-ferrari-250gt-pfcab-gray-sale?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">restoration process</a>, this Ferrari was completely stripped down to the bare metal and restored back to like-new condition with everything from the tires to the top being rebuilt or replaced along the way. It still has the original drivetrain, and it was repainted and refinished in the same Grigio Ferro exterior paint over Natural leather interior; it even comes with a matching hardtop, which apparently is a rare option.</p>
<p>This car was shown at Cavallino in 2017 shortly after its restoration, and no surprise, it won the Platinum award from the International Advisory Council for the Preservation of Ferrari Automobiles (IAC/PFA) as well as the Wayne Obry Excellence in Restoration Special Award. Due to "jumpy" market conditions right now, Farland Classic Restoration isn't putting a price tag on this 1960 Ferrari 250GT Cabriolet, but recent sales of this make/model include a just under <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/am19/amelia-island/lots/r0126-1960-ferrari-250-gt-cabriolet-series-ii-by-pinin-farina/747168" rel="noopener">$1.3 million in 2013</a>, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az16/arizona/lots/r153-1960-ferrari-250-gt-cabriolet-series-ii-by-pinin-farina/175070">$1.65 million in 2016</a> and a little over <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/AZ18/Arizona/lots/r114-1960-ferrari-250-gt-cabriolet-series-ii-by-pininfarina/544471" rel="noopener">$1.4 million last year</a>.</p>

<p>Only 200 of these cars were ever built, and it's hard to believe that one might be in better condition than this one (although in the world of restored Ferraris, that is completely possible).</p>
