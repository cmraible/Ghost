<p>I’ve just finished an hour or two looking at Paris hotels. Why? Because it’s coming around to the <a href="http://www.leweb.net/">Le Web</a> time, and I need to get my ducks in a row.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Le Web has become, I think, the major gathering point of the European Web 2.0 community each December – significant enough now that more and more major players from the states are making the trip over. This will be my fifth Le Web, and my first as one of [the official bloggers](http://www.leweb.net/community/2010/bloggers-program). What does that mean? I’ll be doing [all the liveblogging I normally do](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/business/le_web_3/), except with a little more access to speakers and organisers – which will be cool. </div>

<div>Here’s a video outlining what to expect this year:</div>

    </object></div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m really looking forward to it. Le Web seems to go through cycles of controversy, from 2006’s “[political hijack](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2006/12/le_web_3_the_sa.html)” to 2008 “[deepfreeze](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2008/12/le_web_blogger_dies_of_starvat.html)“. That makes this year a controversial year – and that should be a blast.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There’s still time to sign up [to join us in Paris](http://www.leweb.net/register). Let me know if you’re going to be there…</div><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
