          "File this under one of the weirder stories we’ve seen this week: a man in Chicago rammed into his own car which had been stolen in an attempt to stop the thieves. It’s the kind of vigilantism that police usually tell you to not engage in, especially since the thieves started shooting at him when they noticed the guy was following the car. It also highlights how everyday citizens are getting fed up with a system which refuses to crack down on crime."

That’s when the guy decided to follow his stolen property but the three guys inside must have noticed, because they opened fire."

Considering the thieves had already demonstrated a willingness to kill him, that was probably not the wisest move. The suspects thankfully just jumped out of the HRV and ran."

He was taken to the hospital and was in good condition. The state of the two cars wasn’t mentioned, but we wouldn’t be surprised if both were totaled. We’ve heard of some insurance companies just totaling stolen cars, so even if you get your ride back it will have a salvage title should you decide to keep it."

Perhaps that’s why citizens are becoming more willing to take matters into their own hands instead of just trusting the justice system to work."
