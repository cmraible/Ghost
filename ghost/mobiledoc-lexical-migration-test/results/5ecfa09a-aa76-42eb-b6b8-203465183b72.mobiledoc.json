Literally, every part of this car has been gone over in detail, including being treated to a fresh application of Cameo White and Hurst Gold with hand-painted black pinstripes for authenticity. The concours-level restoration is complete with a black grille, dual racing mirrors, factory badging, and of course the fiberglass hood with functional scoops."

The engine bay is absolutely worthy of showing off at even the most competitive events. The winner will also enjoy a Turbo 400 automatic transmission with a Hurst shifter. A Positraction 3.23 rear helps put that power to the road for plenty of tire-smoking fun."
