Some people seem to not understand even if your ride isn’t swiped, as more are all our insurance rates are increased to cover the costs. If you’ve had your vehicle stolen, you know what a pain it is to file a claim and go through the process of replacing it. Then there are the cars you can’t really replace because of the sentimental attachment. That’s what a woman in the Seattle area is dealing with after her 1967 Ford Mustang was stolen from an auto shop recently."

On January 27 she received a call letting her know the Ford was ready to pick up, however she wasn’t able to make it there before the shop closed. Thinking she would pick it up in the morning, she received a call from police before she could head over there, learning the business was broken into and her beloved vehicle was stolen."
