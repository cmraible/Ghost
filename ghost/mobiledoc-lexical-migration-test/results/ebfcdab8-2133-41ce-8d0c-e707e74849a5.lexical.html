<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Nissan/Skyline%20GT-R">Nissan Skyline GT-R</a> holds a fearsome reputation for supercar slaying even to this day. Its combination of powerful turbocharging and all-wheel drive enabled it to punch well above its weight, but this formula for success was first put into practice with the R32 model of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Arguably the founding father of the modern GT-R, the R32 is a coveted machine that is becoming increasingly hard to come by. Its popularity with tuners means that a bone-stock example is something of a hidden gem, however, we’ve found this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167272/1990-nissan-skyline-gt-r">clean coupe</a> in our classifieds.</p>

<p>Brought into America by import specialist Toprank Motorworks, this 1990 car can now be freely driven stateside thanks to being over 25 years-old. Presented in a deep cherry red, the car appears exactly as the manufacturer intended. There’s no information on any restoration work that may have been undertaken, but either way, this sub-50,000 mile car appears pristine.</p>

<p>Its immaculate presentation continues through to the cabin where it appears almost untouched. Blue fabric and Alcantara sports seats hug occupants just as they did back in 1990, and its plastic trims look to be free of scuff traditionally associated with age. The only aftermarket add-on in the car in a stereo unit ironically made by Mitsubishi. In the trunk you’ll note that the car has also retained its original spare wheel.</p>
<p>Under the hood is the seemingly bulletproof RB26DETT 2.6-liter inline-six engine. Twin-turbocharged, the unit is capable of 276-horsepower and 260lb ft of torque — however, it is often said that these official figures are conservative. A 0-60mph sprint of just 5.6 seconds meant that the R32 GT-R was faster than an E30 BMW M3 or a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1989-porsche-911-carrera-for-grabs/">1989 Porsche 911</a> Turbo.</p>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167272/1990-nissan-skyline-gt-r">car</a> is currently listed for $41,995 and is sure to continue on as an appreciating modern classic.</p>
