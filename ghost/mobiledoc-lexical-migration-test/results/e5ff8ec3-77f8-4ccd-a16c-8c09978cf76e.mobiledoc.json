It has been fitted with a Holley 4V carburetor, an Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold, and a Comp Cams CB-270H camshaft. This combination of parts produces an estimated 360-horsepower. Supporting all of the newfound power is a GM HEI Distributor with MSD ignition wires, an Edelbrock high volume fuel pump, a set of Hedman ceramic coated headers, and an M20 Muncie 4-speed transmission with a Hurst shifter."
