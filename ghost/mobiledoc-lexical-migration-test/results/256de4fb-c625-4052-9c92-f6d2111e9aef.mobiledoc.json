When officers originally responded to the call, they were told about two stolen vehicles kept in the area. After securing a search warrant, cops returned and checked 100 of the cars on the property, finding 20 of them had been stolen."

We’ve tried to highlight before the security flaws many claim are present in modern Mopars. Thieves seem to be able to reprogram the ignition in a matter of minutes, making it a popular way to boost Hellcats and other high-performance models."

Thieves are looking to steal your ride, especially if it’s a modern Mopar, so you need to take extra precautions. We could list out what those would be, but you likely know of more than a few ways. One big thing you can do is park your car in a garage at night and not rely on a powered opener to act as security."
