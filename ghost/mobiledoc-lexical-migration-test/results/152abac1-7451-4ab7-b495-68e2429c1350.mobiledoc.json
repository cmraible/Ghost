A great example comes via an awful incident involving a stolen Dodge Challenger Hellcat in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania which went down way back on September 10. The end result was two people lost their lives."

Just because someone is riding in a stolen car doesn’t mean they stole it or that they know it was stolen. Yes, the driver was speeding and ran from police, so that doesn’t look good, but we don’t think anyone deserves to die just for that. Instead, two people were victims of the driver’s poor choices."

If you’ve ever had a vehicle stolen, you know the kind of stress it causes and the additional expenses insurance just doesn’t cover. Plus, as insurance companies have to pay out on more stolen cars, the rates in different areas increase, so we all end up being victimized financially."
