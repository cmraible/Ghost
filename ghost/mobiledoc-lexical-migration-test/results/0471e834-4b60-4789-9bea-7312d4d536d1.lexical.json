And so, if you're reading these words, I know you're reading the newsletter, not the blog post.</p><p>I've done this in the past - but manually. I published the email version first, and then went back and edited out the email-specific content afterwards. Now, I can do it all in the CMS before I press \"publish\". <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnONolan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">John</a> and his team are doing really interesting things building a CMS built for a level of audience engagement work from the start. And it's exciting getting new features to explore every month or so.</p><p>You can read more about <a href=\"https://ghost.org/changelog/email-cards/\">this new feature of Ghost</a> over on their blog.</p><p><em>If you enjoyed this newsletter, please consider recommending it to others whom you think would find it useful.
