Classic car collectors love these things in stock form as the split window models are some of the rarest cars ever to hit the nation's sales floor. That means that, for purists, modification is a big no-no, but we car enthusiasts don't like it when other people tell us what to do with our cars. This particular car serves as a testament to the ever-present rebellious energy that lives within all of us. Despite being one of the most desirable and valuable cars on the classic collector market, this vicious 'Vette has been customized to fit the exact personality of its owner. So what is it about the car that makes it so terrifying to classic purists everywhere?",

It's simple and clean with a ton of attention to detail without all of the \"in your face\" luxury that modern luxury cars seem to love. Additionally, it would appear that Roadster Shop did some work to open up the inside space. The seating is reportedly very comfortable, despite the Corvette always having a bit of a problem with vertical space.",
