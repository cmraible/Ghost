Apocalypse, which is based in Florida, loads the big, heavy Jeep with plenty of power via a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 like what you find in a Hellcat, only tuned for even better peformance. Claimed 0-60 acceleration is 3.7 seconds, so even though it might looking like a lumbering tank to many, it can scoot in a hurry."

While Doncic and many others use these rigs in urban environments, they‚Äôre good for at least some off-roading situations, although we question how well they‚Äôd handle certain technical trails. Still, the aggressive looks and the sheer size of these things always cause a ruckus no matter who‚Äôs driving them."
