<p>Good things are happening! The Debt Collective is organizing to cancel all kinds of debt and just notched a huge victory that could change the lives of thousands of people on probation. Georgians elected two Democratic senators on the promise of expanded health insurance coverage, and they could get just that if Biden’s compromise reconciliation bill passes. And the city of Chicago is using American Rescue Plan aid to send cash to thousands of households each month.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s You Love To See It, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p>

The effort went dormant over the last five years as activists turned their sights to other projects they felt would bring about more systemic change. On Friday, the group announced a return to extinguishing debts outright, saying it had canceled $3.2 million in probation debt as ‘an act of solidarity’ amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In the portfolio purchased by the group, the average debtor owed $159. The Rolling Jubilee Fund had been able to purchase all of it for just $97,922.”</em></p>

Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have been vocal proponents of Medicaid expansion in Georgia. Biden’s Build Back Better proposal includes a provision to close the Medicaid coverage gap in Georgia and the 11 other states where states have refused to expand Medicaid. Warnock’s office said the expansion will provide health insurance to about 646,000 Georgians who make too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage but make too little money to afford coverage on the marketplace.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
