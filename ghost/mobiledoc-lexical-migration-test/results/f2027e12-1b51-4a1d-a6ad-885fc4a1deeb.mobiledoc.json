After all, with the 427ci V8 pumping out a mighty 425-horsepower and 460 lb.-ft. of torque, few can stand up to that kind of power. Add to the setup a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission plus 4.10 rear gears and this thing is pretty tough to beat on the drag strip. Plus, this thing only weighs 3,526 pounds with the driver inside, making for a killer power-to-weight ratio."

While the official output is a mere 270-hp, keep in mind how that was measured changed, so this isn’t an apples to apples comparison on paper. Torque comes in at 390 lb.-ft. and the engine is paired with a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission. Helping get this Buick scooting at 3.42 gears in the rear. With a weight of 3,956 pounds including the driver, this big boy should have its hands full with the COPO Camaro."
