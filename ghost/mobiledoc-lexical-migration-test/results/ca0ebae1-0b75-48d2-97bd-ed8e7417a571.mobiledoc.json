Although specified as having only six cylinders, this vehicle still pushes out a healthy 130 horsepower, a considerable number for its time. Furthermore, a set of triple Solex Carburetors allow this incredible power figure to be achieved and keeps maximum power at around 4,400 pm. This all adds to a great performance vehicle from its era with plenty of road capabilities for an enthusiastic driver."

In addition, a deep blue paint covers the entire body, which gives the car a shiny figure with extenuated curves and a great contrast against the wheels. This car is like the echo of a time when style and uniqueness still mattered to most automotive manufacturers. That's what makes this car an excellent choice for any collector looking for a new vehicle to complete their collection and stand out in the crowd."
