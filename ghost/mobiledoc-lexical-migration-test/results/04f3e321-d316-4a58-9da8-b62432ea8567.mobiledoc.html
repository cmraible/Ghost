<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=13491">Wearing a clean</a> green and woodgrain, this Ambassador has been optioned up to the hilt. Among the factory-included options is air conditioning, something you don’t always get in classic cars like this. Power steering and power brakes help you keep that exterior free from blemishes. Even more of a pampering feature is the reclining twin comfort lounge seating, which is fantastic for long trips and presents very well.</p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=13491">This 1973 AMC Ambassador Brougham</a> 4 door Station Wagon is a  blast from the past and has plenty of power, thanks to AMC dropping a massive 401 cubic inch V8 engine, which is mated to a torque-command column shift. The drivetrain feeds into a Twin grip differential. This vintage wagon was ordered new at Hill View Motors in Greensburg PA as a demo.</p>
