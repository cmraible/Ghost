            "text": "German Milivié restomod shop likes to take iconic German cars and transform them into modern-day machines. Its latest creation, a restomod Volkswagen Beetle, is really making waves for several reasons. First off, the cost is a steep €570,000 or about $603,487 which is enough to make anyone’s eyes water. Perhaps the company realizes precious few would be interested in dropping that kind of cash on such a creation, especially when you calculate how many people can afford such an extravagance. That would explain why production is limited to a mere 22 examples.",
