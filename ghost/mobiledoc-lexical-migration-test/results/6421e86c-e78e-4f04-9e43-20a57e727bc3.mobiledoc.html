<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Today we published investigative reporter Andrew Perez’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/we-still-dont-know-who-is-paying/">major story</a> about how the darkest of dark money is now trying to buy another Supreme Court seat. We are digging through IRS and corporate records to try to discover who is funding a massive new ad campaign to install Trump’s Supreme Court pick.</p>
<p><strong>Can you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here and pitch in</a> and become a supporting subscriber to help fund this kind of reporting?</strong></p>
<p>We are 100% grassroots funded — when you become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber, those resources go directly to helping us hire more reporters and do more digging into these kinds of stories. We have already been breaking major stories (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/likely-trump-scotus-pick-worked-to/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/barrett-crushed-gig-workers-weeks/">here</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/memo-suggests-tactics-for-dems-to/">here</a>) on the Supreme Court battle — and we want to do much more.</p>
<p><strong>But we need as many free subscribers to <a href="#/portal/signup">click here and pitch in</a> to become supporting subscribers.</strong></p>
