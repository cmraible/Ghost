The interior of this car looks even better with no rips, tears or obvious wearing apparent on the seats or carpet, and like the exterior, all the interior parts seem to be there as well."

Under the hood is a 300-horsepower 351 CID V8 with four-barrel carburetor, which is paired to an automatic transmission and a nine-inch rear end with 3.00 gears. With this particular engine, Mach 1 Mustangs vary in value from an average retail price in the mid-to-high $30,000 range up to more than $60,000 for a councours-quality example."
