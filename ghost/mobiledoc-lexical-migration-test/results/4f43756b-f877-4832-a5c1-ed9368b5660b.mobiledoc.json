That brings us to this junkyard somewhere in Nebraska, a state which is especially stimulating to drive across, trust us. Littered across the landscape is a shocking amount of really cool old iron, so much it makes us excited and a little sad at the same time."

They got access to this junkyard, which is on private land, because they know the owner. And they say he’s always bringing new vehicles home, and by that we mean troubled classics. So before you start whining that all the cool old rides are all gone, just remember guys like this one sure seem to have little trouble finding them hiding in all the nooks and crannies."
