It features a full steel tube frame and a 195-horsepower 2.3-liter flat four mid-mounted engine. For those that see a pre-200-horsepower rating as too little, remember the RS010’s lightweight design means that the engine is only carrying 1,350-lbs. What this means is that the car's power-weight ratio, .014:1, is equivalent to the average V8 powered car but without the weighty feel that degrades a cars ability in the corners. This recipe should make for a car with staggering performance, strong acceleration and nimble handling."

The dash draws inspiration for 1950’s era aircraft and actually features a clock from a Soviet MiG jet. While the cockpit does look a bit cramped and the frame is visible from inside the vehicle in a sort of roll cage type fashion, there is an elegance about the interior that is very easy to appreciate."
