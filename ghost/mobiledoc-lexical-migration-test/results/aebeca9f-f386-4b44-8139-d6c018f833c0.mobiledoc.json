First it did away with couch co-op for a more robust online suite, and then they dropped multiplayer altogether in order to focus more on single-player gameplay, which developers and publishers now know, without a doubt, definitely sells.

Each level has a set amount of goals that must be completed in a small amount of time, with plenty of hazards and not a lot of room to work.

It removes all of the stress and chaos from the game that is the game’s main selling point, and turns it into a boring chore simulator. The normal difficulty when played alone isn’t balanced, which makes the game difficult in a very annoying sense. Every task you’re given has a time limit, and failure to complete the task within the time limit resets the task completely. Imagine being halfway across the map, and your tent explodes into a pile of sticks and rope while you’re gathering rocks. By the time you start heading back, the squirrels have come to take your sticks, as is of course the usual concern when camping, and scatter your rope and packed tent to the four winds."

They are made to look cartoonish with things like big, wide eyes and four fingered hands, however there is a little too much detail which ends up making them look uncomfortable. One particular issue I want to mention is the character Covington, while he wears a turban, it was fairly hard to tell when looking at his character in-game as the amount of detail made it look like hair. Finally on this topic, I respect the team for putting racial diversity in the game by making two of the three characters nonwhite, however I must raise an eyebrow on the racial sensitivity front. Quintana is a black, Australian Indiginous girl who has a little bit too much attention given to her lips when no other character has lips at all."
