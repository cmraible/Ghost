<p><a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1974-porsche-911-targa-7/">Porsche is possibly</a> the most iconic and recognizable European automotive brand of the <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1974-porsche-911-rs-outlaw/">early 1970s</a> for its innate ability to change and grow with the ever-fluctuating restrictions that beseech the automotive industry. These vehicles were somehow able to provide just as much performance and be just as fun to drive as the pre-gas-crisis cars that we all know and love today. Models like the 911 and other variants of the flagship Porsche sports car were taking over the European performance car market, which is why this particular car is an excellent option for any automotive enthusiast looking for some track fun in a Porsche of their own. These two impressive 911s can join, or start your Porsche collection.</p>

<p>A prior owner of this Porsche 911 tastefully modified the car to include widened RS-style bodywork, new interior, and a beefed up 2.7-liter engine. The work including fitting it with with wide fiberglass fender flares along with an RSR-style front bumper, RS-style ducktail rear spoiler, and modern projector headlights. Itâ€™s only been driven less than 200 miles since the modifications, and it looks sharp. See it <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1974-porsche-911-rs-outlaw/">here</a>.</p>
