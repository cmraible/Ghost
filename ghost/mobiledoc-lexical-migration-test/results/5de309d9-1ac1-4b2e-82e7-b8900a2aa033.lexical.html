<p>Today at 4pm ET / 1pm PT, we are excited to host a special live Callin show for <em>The Lever</em>’s paid supporting subscribers. As we begin another year of independent journalism, we are asking the question, “What’s Going To Be The Biggest Story Of 2023?” This is a great opportunity for subscribers to hear about our priorities for the coming year and give input and feedback. David Sirota will be taking questions and suggestions from supporting subscribers LIVE on-air.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting subscribers will receive a private link to the event shortly before it begins. If you are not yet a supporting subscriber, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/membership/?utm_source=newsletter-email&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=newsletter-upgrade"><strong>click here to upgrade</strong></a> and gain full access.</strong></p>
