<p>No, your eyes aren’t playing tricks on you. This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/170263/1938-chevrolet-master-deluxe">1938 Chevrolet Master Deluxe</a> is sporting a pretty wild and colorful exterior. What if we told you that it had a matching interior to boot? Well, such is the case here. The Chevrolet Master (the HB) and Master Deluxe (the HA) are American passenger vehicles that were produced between 1933 and 1942 to replaced the Chevy Eagle. The Chevrolet Master was also one of the more expensive models in the automaker’s range at this time. A top-of-the-line Special Deluxe was launched from 1940 onward.</p>
<p>Regardless of the trim level, the HA cars sold over 302,000 units and were very popular with hot rodders. This is mainly because of the ease of availability when it came to parts, as well as the simplicity of replacing the engine. Many versions survive today, but that does not make this example less valuable or less desirable in any way – especially when you see all of its unique touches. It's currently up for sale through <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Classic+Auto+Mall">Classic Auto Mall</a>, so act fast if this is your cup of tea.</p>

<p>The exterior is mainly two-toned; it’s dressed in purple with yellow up top. What’s more, it has some additional rainbow striping that really sets it apart. The pink, teal, and yellow prismatic stripes are somewhat “Pink Floyd”-esque and are splashed across the front of the rear quarters to the bottom of the front fenders. All in all, this two-door sedan is in great shape and shows no rust. It sits proud on American Racing Torq II chrome wheels at all four corners. The sealed beam headlights illuminate the path ahead, while the bright LED taillights signal your passage to the cars that fall behind.</p>
<p>The interior of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=1938+master+deluxe">1938 Chevrolet Master Deluxe</a> is just as loud as the outside. Open the door and you immediately see the pop of rainbow color on the doors and panels, while the two-tone seats, purple dashboard, and tan background solidify the look. Cabin goodies include Rocky Hinge power windows, Bear Claw power locks, an AM/FM/CD stereo, vintage air conditioning, and a pristine stainless dash that houses the gauges.</p>
