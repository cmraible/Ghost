<hr>
<p>Some people feel extremely passionate about which gas station they use for all their caffeine and MSG consumption needs, which presumably is why 7-Eleven is upping the ante by giving away a customized Ford Mustang. Called Model 711 (get it?) this thing makes me want to vomit, and not because it’s a Mustang. Some people might just love it to death, but to me it represents everything wrong with gas station culture, which I’ve been told is going to be obliterated once electric cars sweep the landscape clean. After seeing this abomination, I wish that were true.</p>

<p>Immediately, the most striking thing about this Mustang is the striping which is just like what you find on your local 7-Eleven. A lot of people will be impressed by that just before they ask you to put $20 on Pump 5 and ask where the churros are.</p>

<p>You’ll also note the pony grille badge has been replaced by a night owl because reasons. Around back by the fuel filler is the declaration “Build For Speed & Snacks” as well as “Need For Slurpee.” On the other side is “Another One Bits The Crust.” Everyone wants a Mustang with dad jokes slapped all over it. But wait, the interior has plenty more cringe kitsch.</p>

<p>Not only can you fit your Big Gulp in the cupholder, which you can do in any Mustang, this build comes with a pizza slice holder which slides into the other cupholder. That means you can easily consume both corn syrup and grease while cruising around town.</p>

<p>There’s also a shifter knob made to look like a Slurpee, which we’re sure just fits right into the palm of your hand with the straw sticking up. The seat inserts repeat the same color scheme as the famous stripes on the 7-Eleven storefronts. Finally, there’s an air “freshener” that smells like the burned coffee you’re always greeted with at the convenience stores. The only thing the car is missing is sticky floors.</p>
