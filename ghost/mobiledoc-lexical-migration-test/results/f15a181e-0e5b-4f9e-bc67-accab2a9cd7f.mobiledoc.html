<p>If I were to describe DoNotPay in a single word it would have to be: <strong>superhero</strong>. The service is multi-functional, it can act as a robot lawyer that disputes parking tickets on your behalf, automatically cancels your free trials (it even gives you separate virtual credit card numbers, so you never have to worry about canceling a trial and having it billed on your CC), plus a whole slew of other things like finding you refunds you never knew existed and suing people.</p>
<p>How awesome is that?! I know!</p>
<h2 id="virtual-credit-cards-for-free-trials">Virtual credit cards for free trials</h2>
<p>The very first feature I decided to test out was the virtual credit card feature. With this feature you can painlessly sign up for free trials using the card number provided by DoNotPay, this way you never have to use your real credit card. What's even better is that DoNotPay is so convinced and sure of their technology that if there is a charge on the card, you're not responsible for it. </p>

<p>In my tests, I generated a credit card number using the company's tool and used it to sign up for a free trial of Paramount Plus – and despite the card generator seemingly indicating it only works for a handful of services, the card generated worked just fine for Paramount Plus. I had to enter a fake address when signing up, but the actual card number, CVC, expiry, and zip code all worked perfectly. In fact, I'm currently watching <em>NCIS</em> while typing out this article.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-burner-phone-number">Get a burner phone number</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/dnt-burner-number.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1394" height="1060" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/dnt-burner-number.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/dnt-burner-number.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/dnt-burner-number.png 1394w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>With DoNotPay, you have the ability to generate temporary phone numbers that you can use to bypass verifications for subscriptions, dating apps, and other services that require phone authentications. To ensure privacy and prevent spam, the numbers generated are intended for one-time use only, meaning once the user creates a number, it is only accessible for 10 minutes before the text message is deleted and the number is deactivated. </p>
<p>If for some reason the system tells you no burner number's are available, simply retry creating one. This happened to me once and a few seconds later it worked.</p>
<h2 id="take-back-your-email">Take back your email</h2>
<p>If you want your email to actually work for you, then look into DoNotPay email. It's an AI powered email that automatically analyzes every incoming email and identifies a way for you to save time or money using one of DoNotPay’s hundreds of consumer rights products. It's pretty magical. For example, if you get an email from your gym, your DoNotPay email will ask you if you want to cancel your membership with just one-click. Or if you receive an email receipt for terrible in-flight WiFi (once you start flying again), DoNotPay will fight the airline for a refund – all automatically.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you forward a message to the anti-spam tool and then keep getting emails from the same entity, the service will take the hallmark DoNotPay approach and automatically help you sue the spammer in small-claims court for up to $500 under the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/01/open-up-a-can-of-spam/">CAN-SPAM Act</a>. It's a small way to try to take on the spamming industrial complex, but with DoNotPay on your side it's certainly a lot less daunting to assert your rights.</p>
<h2 id="but-there-s-lots-more">But there's (lots) more</h2>
<p>In total, <a href="https://donotpay.com">DoNotPay</a> has <strong>more than 120</strong> different tasks it can do, all with the focus to make your life easier. Heck, DoNotPay can even write your will (no joke)! That being said, even with DoNotPay writing your will, I'd likely still have a human lawyer take a look – just to be sure. But overall, I'm impressed by the wide range of services offered by DoNotPay. The service costs $36/year which is charged to your credit card upon signing up. As of last month, DoNotPay has 150,000 paid subscribers, and has aided in more than 1.5 million cases so far.</p>
