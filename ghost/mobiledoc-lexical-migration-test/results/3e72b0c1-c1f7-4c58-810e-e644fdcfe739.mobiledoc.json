In place of the big-block V8, this Chevelle is powered by a supercharged LSA V8 that started with a 6.0-liter displacement and was then bored and stroked to 408 cubic inches (almost 6.7 liters). This engine received LS3 heads, a custom camshaft and upgraded internals resulting in 597 horsepower measured at the rear wheels on a dyno. A 4L80E automatic transmission was built up to handle all that power, and a Ford nine-inch rear end with a Detroit Locker helps send all that power to the ground."

The Marina Blue paint job is perfectly accented with gorgeous chrome elements, and the all-blue interior looks as good as it did back in 1967. This cabin was upgraded with digital gauges and an aftermarket sound system, but the seats, center console and steering wheel are all stock."
