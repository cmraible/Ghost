If you do work out a way to snag one, be prepared to pony up big. Each one is selling for about 15 million yen, which is approximately $145,000 USD. That price point makes it even more exclusive and will only add fuel to the fire when it comes to collectibility."

Considering the lofty price, if that were the case customers would be shelling out even more cash."

Even though it’s not the most powerful option for the 8 Series it’s still a wonderful engine. You also get to choose four different paint options to dress up the car: Aventurine Red, Azurite Black, Davit Grey, and Tanzinite Blue. All are BMW Individual colors with a richness and depth which will dazzle the eye."
