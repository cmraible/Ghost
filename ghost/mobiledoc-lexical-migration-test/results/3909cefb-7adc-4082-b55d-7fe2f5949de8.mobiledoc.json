It was mildly changed with an eggcrate grille insert to replace the previous horizontal bars and the roof-mounted extractor vents were ditched in 1966. Head rests became an option. Even without a major change for the year, it would prove to be a record busting year in sales, with 4,200 more units sold than 1965, for a total of 27,720 1966 Corvettes sold. To date, they also tend to be the cars the pull in record setting bids through auction house."
