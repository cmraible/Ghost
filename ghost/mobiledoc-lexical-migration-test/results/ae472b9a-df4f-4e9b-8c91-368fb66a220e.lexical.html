<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/off-road-lincoln-limo/">Off-road racing</a>, one of America’s favorite automotive pass times in which a driver is tasked with dealing with the various challenges that accompany a dirt track. For most, the answer to the lack of grip, extremely rough terrain, and highly competitive attitude surrounding the sport is the iconic trophy truck. However, for those who crave a more powerful, better handling, and sleeker vehicle this focus on the world of trucks is simply not enough. That is exactly where this build comes in. With the might of a thousand Italian thunderstorms, this car was quickly turned from a corner-carving track monster to an offroad beast. </p>
<p>Of course, we're talking about one of Italy's finest and fastest supercars, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/liberty-walk-twin-turbo-lamborghini-huracan-breathes-fire/">Lamborghini Huracan</a>. When most people think of the perfect Lamborghini they may not picture it doing some of the stuff that this thing can do. Rather than showing off its various vehicular abilities on the autocross track on some drag strip, this raging bull barrels through the dirt at ridiculous speeds to show the pretty boys of the show truck industry how it's done. Of course, this is done via the use of a variety of modifications including a set of gigantic wheels and offroading tires, a plethora of engine upgrades, and some suspension work which gives the car a hell of a lot more ride height over its stock counterparts. </p>
<p>It should be quite obvious, from the looks of it, that this thing is ready to throw down with the best of the best. This is further driven home by the fact that the driver is extremely experienced and capable of using the car exactly how it should be wielded. However, no good build would be complete without a track day to test and showcase the car’s ability. This proved to be quite necessary for the car as the team would later find out that they need a lot more ride height and a skid plate once they hit the whoops. The car did pretty well with the jumps however it would appear that the car’s high power and awesome acceleration is going to be a bit of a challenge with the larger jumps. Overall, this car has a lot more boogying to do before it can officially hit the track but we hope to follow it closely on its journey to superstardom. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBQrnSykjhU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
