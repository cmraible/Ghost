Well, you have to read to find out!&nbsp;</p><p>Also, I wanted to take this time to let everyone know about a new app which I'm obsessed with: <a href=\"https://listory.onelink.me/q8of/curators?name=besttechie\">Listory</a>. The company is focusing on helping people discover content from quality creators and I'm all about it. It's kind of funny because this app has a similar approach as I had when I released the Shout app. Anyway, you should definitely check out the app and <a href=\"https://www.listory.com/techieticker\">give me a follow</a>.

Any content that has Dolby Atmos will work. I'm still exploring to see if I can find more content that can take advantage of the functionality but so far that's all I've gotten to work. Now many services such as Disney+ offer content with Dolby Atmos sound, including Star Wars and Marvel movies so that's a good place to start. Unfortunately, Apple TV (even the most recent 4K model) isn't powerful enough to offer spatial audio but I'd imagine that future versions will be."

But what about the audio transparency feature that lets you hear your surroundings? Is that any good? As it turns out, yes it's very good. I tested it while ordering some munster cheese at the deli counter. With the transparency feature enabled I was able to hear the clerk and interact with them without having to fully remove the headphones. Now, I say fully because there was a time or two where I had to partially move one of the ear cups to ensure I heard what the clerk said to me, but I'm currently attributing that to the fact she was a wearing a mask.
