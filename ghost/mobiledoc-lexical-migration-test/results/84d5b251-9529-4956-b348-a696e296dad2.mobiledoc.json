We played in a fashion whereby one of us focused on getting the ball and making things happen, while the other one did the dirty work; tackling opposition players off the ball and grabbing Hyper Shot balls when they appear (Hyper Shot is a power up that, if pulled off, means you score two goals for the price of one). You pick a team of four outfield players (the goalie is always Boom Boom) and each cup you choose to tackle has opposition with a different bias such as shooting, tackling, movement, etc. So you need to pick your roster accordingly for each cup in how you think is best to win, which puts a fun tactical spin on things."
