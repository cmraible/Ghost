To ensure that it is ready for anything, the buggy features a rigid tubular chassis, solid axles (sourced from a Nissan Patrol) with air-locking differentials front and rear, a 32-gallon fuel cell and a 9,500-pound winch. The equipment list includes just about everything a race team would need to tackle the most challenging of off-road events, and that includes the racing seats with racing harnesses as well as a proper navigator's cockpit featuring an in-dash computer and a sturdy grab bar."
