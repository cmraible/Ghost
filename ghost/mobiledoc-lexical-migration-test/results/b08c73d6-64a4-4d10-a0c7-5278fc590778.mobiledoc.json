          "While in a meeting with some of the movie top dogs such as Director, John Singleton, Picture Car Captain, Ted Moser, and David Marder as well as many crew members, the topic came up about a sponsorship deal with Dodge. This sounds like a great idea on the surface, that is until you see what car they were going to use. Unfortunately, the head of product placement had decided on using a Dodge Neon SRT4 which Craig describes as little more than a cheap rental car. After a long argument and clever negotiation, he was able to convince them that the car they should’ve picked was the "

          "Another story with a semi-happy ending started with a rental car and ended in a potentially fatal accident. In the movie 2Fast 2Furious, there was a scene in which the S2000 had to jump a bridge in a glorious display of movie special effects and the franchise’s signature focus on stunts. As the S2000 only came in manual and the fact that the stunt was too dangerous for a human driver, the team had to rig a remote control system for the car.

Thankfully no one was seriously injured and the Durango was fixed before being brought back to the rental company."
