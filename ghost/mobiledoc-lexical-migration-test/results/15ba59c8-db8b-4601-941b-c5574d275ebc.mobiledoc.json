Such problems can be anything from the engine failing to the infotainment touchscreen not being responsive enough. Most of the problems reported were electronic, according to J.D. Power, with mechanical issues in 3-year-old cars quite rare. You can frame that information however you want, but we think that’s a positive sign."
