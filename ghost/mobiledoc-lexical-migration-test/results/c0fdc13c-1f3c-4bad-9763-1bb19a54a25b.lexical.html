<p>This is a great read, full of ideas you can plunder for your own strategy. </p>

<h2 id="community-management-lessons-from-the-gather-modsquad">Community management lessons from the Gather ModSquad</h2>
<p>I've had this tab open for a week, and finally read it last night, while procrastinating over something else. Some good insights about how to shepherd a volunteer team and delivery a good experience for a community. </p>

            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">When we started Gather Slack in early 2018, the idea was that it would be a place for our community of practice, to, well, gather and engage with one another. At that point, Gather as a site was just…</div>

<h2 id="civils-end">Civil's End</h2>
<p>Well, I was able to cross something off my "to do" list, just by reading a headline. I like that efficiency. "Figure out what Civil is actually doing" has been sitting there for over a year, and perhaps that was the heart of the problem. When someone with 15 years of interest in journalism innovation can't quite figure out - or isn't inspired to understand - what you're doing, how are you going to get the word out? </p>

<h2 id="social-video-positivity">Social Video Positivity</h2>
<p>Forget "if it bleeds, it leads". How about "if it's cute, it shoots"? CBS have been finding that <a href="https://www.wochit.com/blog/cbs-news-found-a-social-video-format-that-overperforms/">a positive style of social video</a> is massively over-performing for them:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>They generate nearly 200% higher link clicks per post</em></li>
    <li><em>Reach 500% more people per post</em></li>
    <li><em>Receive nearly 2,000% more engagements (comments, likes, shares) per post</em></li>
    <li><em>Have an 18% higher completion rate with an average video length of 1:19</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example: </p>
