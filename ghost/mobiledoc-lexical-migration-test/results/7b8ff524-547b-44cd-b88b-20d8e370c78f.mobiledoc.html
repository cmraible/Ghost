<p>After Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away last September, the Judicial Crisis Network, the darkest of conservative dark money groups, immediately launched a multi-million dollar campaign to push forward a conservative nominee, even before President Donald Trump selected Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee. It turns out that, in the lead-up to the court fight, the organization received $14 million from a single mystery donor, according to documents obtained by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>

<p>Over half of emergency ground ambulance rides result in patients receiving an out-of-network charge, according to <a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/ground-ambulance-rides-and-potential-for-surprise-billing/">new research</a> from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Those out-of-network charges, which arise in emergency situations where patients don’t have the chance to seek out alternatives, are also known as surprise medical bills. Congress passed a law to address surprise billing as part of the December 2020 budget bill, but it didn’t extend the new rule to include ground ambulance rides.</p>

<p>The conservative dark money group that led the campaign to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat with Amy Coney Barrett received more than $14 million from a single mystery donor in the lead-up to the confirmation fight, according to documents obtained by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>
<p>The Concord Fund is the new parent nonprofit of the Judicial Crisis Network, a secretive dark money group that has been bankrolling campaigns to install GOP judges and funding conservative advocacy campaigns around the country since 2004.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>After Ginsburg’s death in September last year, the Judicial Crisis Network immediately started <a href="https://judicialnetwork.com/in-the-news/jcn-launches-multimillion-dollar-initial-ad-blitz-to-fill-scotus-seat/">spending millions</a> on ads calling on Senators to “ignore the extremists, stick to precedent, and confirm the nominee,” who had not yet been named. The group then spent millions more to <a href="https://judicialnetwork.com/in-the-news/confirm-amy/">support</a> Barrett’s confirmation after former President Donald Trump selected her to replace Ginsburg.</p>
<p>The Concord Fund’s latest IRS tax return shows the organization raised $20.4 million between July 2019 and June 2020. While the group is not required to publicly disclose its donors, the tax return shows it received $14.3 million — nearly 70 percent of its total revenue at the time — from a single anonymous source.</p>
