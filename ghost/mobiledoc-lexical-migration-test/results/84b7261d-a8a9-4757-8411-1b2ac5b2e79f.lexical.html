<p><a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">WIN</a>, using promo code 'WIN', this Arctic White <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">2021 Corvette</a> convertible features many Carbon Flash accents that will have you in awe of the style. However, what created that style was <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">Chevrolet’s</a> pursuit of supercar equivalent power. Moving the 495-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 engine to behind the driver’s seat allowed for a remarkably aerodynamic design and an 8-speed automatic transmission offered performance to match. <br></p>

<p>When fitted with the 3LT Equipment Group and the Z51 Performance Package <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">this car</a> moves from supercar level to dream car status. Inside the cockpit you’ll find GT2 bucket seats and a black interior more akin to a luxury car rather than a sports car. Coming standard with the Z51 packages are an electronic limited-slip differential, a performance ratio rear axle, and Brembo anti-lock brakes that take the new Corvette’s performance capabilities to an all new level. Meanwhile a Carbon Flash painted nacelles and Carbon Flash painted 5-open-spoke aluminum wheels, a rear spoiler, and a hard top that can be operated at speeds of up to 30-mph add even more style and performance. </p>
