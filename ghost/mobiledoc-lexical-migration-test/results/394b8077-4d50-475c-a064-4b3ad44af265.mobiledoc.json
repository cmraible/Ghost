          "The crucible of motorsport is a never-ending arms race between teams to develop technology to gain an advantage. This is a huge draw for road car manufacturers to get involved as this fast paced innovation can be applied to its road cars. Renault did exactly that with the turbocharged engines it developed for Formula 1. At Rétromobile in France, it will be celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first turbocharged F1 victory, and its contribution to road cars."

          "The turbo-dedicated display at Rétromobile 2019 includes several iconic boosted French cars. A central fixture is the 1979 Renault F1 RS 10 - the first ever turbocharged winner of a world championship F1 race. This car aptly won the French Grand Prix and in doing so, highlighted the advantages of turbocharging to the rest of the grid. It sparked a paradigm shift that lead to the explosive 1000-horsepower F1 cars  of the 1980s."

This high-performance hot hatch featured a mid-mounted 1.4L turbo and was designed with Group 4 rallying in mind. Alpine also got its hands on this car and produced the Renault 5 Alpine Turbo, a car that will also be in attendance."
