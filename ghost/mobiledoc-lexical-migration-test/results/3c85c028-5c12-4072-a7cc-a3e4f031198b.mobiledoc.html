<hr>
<p>We’ve been seeing quite a few <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/digital-concours/">amazing vehicles</a> entered in the <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/">Motorious Digital Concours</a> over the past several weeks. One of them is this pristine <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-shelby-mustang/">1968 Shelby GT500</a> owned by Miguel who obviously and for good reason is proud of his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-mustang-mach-1/">American muscle car</a>.</p>

<p>Not only is it a beautiful machine, this is one of the more desirable <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby</a> models. Miguel said it wasn’t always such a looker. Back in 1983 he was looking through Auto Trader (not the website, kiddies, because that didn’t exist back then) and saw a listing that said “1968 GT500 needs TLC $5,500.” When he went to look at the car it was a mess with cracked paint, plus problems with the engine and drivetrain. In fact, to take the Shelby for a test drive, Miguel had to help the owner replace both rear axles.</p>

<p>Miguel drove the car around, but people didn’t pay much attention to the old gas guzzler. After all, in the 80s many loudly declared American muscle was dead and the future was fuel-sipping cars from Japan.</p>

<p>In the early 90s Miguel gave this Shelby GT500 the attention it deserved, a full restoration. Finally, in 2010 the car attended its first show. No doubt people paid plenty of notice to it by then. That Wimbledon White paint and blue graphics look pristine, as does everything else about this ride. Instead of just letting it sit in the garage, Miguel says he takes it for a drive twice a month, which is fantastic.</p>

<p>As many of you know, the Shelby GT500 was launched with the 1967 model year as Ford and Carroll Shelby’s partnership grew after sweeping the podium at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, humiliating Ferrari. That legendary status combined with the rarity of these early Shelby Mustangs makes a well-sorted example like this one a real treat to see. We’re glad Miguel took the time to share his car with everyone. If you enjoyed it, consider voting for this Shelby GT500 <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries/2/American-Muscle/412">here</a>.</p>
