<p>Adobe is working with Reddit for an art project. Guess what happened. Go on, guess.</p>
<blockquote>Although the subreddit has only been around for a little over a day, individuals attempting to poison the well of this interactive experience are uploading concealed, offensive content.</blockquote>
<p>First rule of any user-generated content project: plan for the trolls. If it's on Reddit, it's the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rule, too. </p>

<p>The old mantra of "if it bleeds, it leads" might be excluding some audiences, according to new research:</p>
<blockquote>These results suggest that if the media want to attract audiences, they don’t necessarily need to only show negative content, say the authors.  “Even as the average tendency may be for viewers to be more attentive to and aroused by negative content, there would appear to be a good number of individuals with rather different or perhaps more mutable preferences,” they write.</blockquote>
