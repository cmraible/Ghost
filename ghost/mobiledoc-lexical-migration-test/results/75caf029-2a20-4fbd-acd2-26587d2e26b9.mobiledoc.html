<hr>
<p>If you’re looking to have some fun behind the wheel but don’t have a huge budget, it might feel like there aren’t many options out there. That’s probably because you’re just looking at new and very old performance models. By going in the middle, say to the 80s or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c4-corvette-rearending/">especially the 90s</a>, you can pick up a fun car without spending that much cash. That’s what this video comparison of the C4 Corvette and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lt1-trans-am-rediscovered/">Fourth-Gen Pontiac Trans Am</a> is about.</p>
<p><strong>Watch three American muscle car rivals race <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-vs-chevy-camaro-vs-dodge/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As TFLclassics points out, you can potentially get either car for under $10,000. Sure, it might take some hunting to find one that’s clean and runs well enough, but your efforts will be rewarded with something that was cool and interesting after that embarrassing feud between MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice everyone thought they had to take sides on.</p>

<p>Now we know what you’re probably thinking: there are faster, more powerful cars out there. True, but can you afford them? If you’re on a tight budget, likely not. It’s always best to stay within your financial means. After all, getting a car you can barely afford to buy, but not being able to maintain it properly, is a boneheaded move. Unlike some more exotic options from Europe, these American performance machines are much more affordable to keep running well.</p>
<p>But which one should you choose? We know all the Corvette fans and sitting there in bright white New Balance shoes as they laugh about how the Camaro is the Corvette’s little brother. That smug attitude often blinds them to the biggest pet peeve of most Firebird owners: it’s not just a reskinned Camaro. And the Trans Am is a legitimate performance vehicle.</p>
<p>Things in the video get really interesting when they decide to benchmark both cars against a modern Mazda CX-30, a little grocery getter your mom or grandmother would probably drive. How do these two cars stack up against each other and the 21st century crossover? Watch the video and find out.</p>
