<p>The <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933">Austin Healey 3000 Mk III</a> is the kind of car you would expect from a car designer, rally driver, and speed record holder. It is both stylish and aerodynamic but not to the point where one takes precedence over the other. A 3.0-liter inline-six balances weight and power and provides the car with a proven record of being able to handle speeds in excess of 100-mph for hours on end. Although well designed, rust is notoriously problematic for these cars especially when it comes to the chassis. A fact that makes finding one of these fun to drive <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933">Big Healeys</a> in good condition hard to find.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Ball-Auction-Service/OK-CLASSICS-FEBRUARY-2021-CLASSIC-CAR-AUCTION/event-catalog/192933">OK Classics February 2021 Classic Car Auction</a>, Proxibid is offering a beautiful example with no history of damage or rust.

<p>Inset in the walnut dash is a set of three gauges with chrome bezels framed by the optional wood grip steering wheel. A black boot cover and full tonneau hides the retracted soft top and perfectly matches the upholstery on the 2+2 seating and the interior is equipped with shoulder seat belts for a more modern touch of safety. Included in the sale is a full-size matching spare and a wooden tool for safely removing the knock-off wheels.</p>
