<p>Classic cars to have to be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/callaway-c7-z06-championship-edition/">rare or expensive</a> to be cool. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-this-2021-chevy-corvette-z51/">Some cars</a>, which we lovingly refer to as "bellybutton cars," are common enough that you can see an example of one at every cruise-in in America.</p>
<p>Of course, due to the pandemic, we haven't gotten out to many car shows and cruise-ins this year, so we're starting to missing seeing those familiar automotive faces. Cars like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/american-icon-1957-chevrolet-bel-air-convertible/">1957 Chevy</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ls-powered-vehicles-on-motorious/">1969 Camaro</a> are popular for a reason – they're gorgeous to look at.</p>

<p>Another great "bellybutton car" is the late C3 Corvette. They're just about everywhere, they aren't particularly expensive, and when they're photographed right...boy, they look terrific.</p>
<p>We love <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/212129/1977-chevrolet-corvette">this 1977 Corvette coupe</a>. it's red over black, with a 350 and an automatic. On paper, there's nothing too special about this car. However, looking at the photos makes us wish we could add it to our garage.</p>

<p>What makes this Corvette special is its impeccable condition. With just 36,000 miles, it still looks like a new car. It's simply beautiful from every angle.</p>
<p>1977 was the last year for the "flying buttress" rear window treatment, replaced with the bubble window a year later. It's hard for us to pick a favorite – we like both styles more or less equally.</p>

<p>Close-up photos show that the body, interior, and engine bay are all incredibly clean. It's what you would expect from a 36,000 mile car, but it's still impressive.</p>
