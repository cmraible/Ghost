The Blue Oval guys will say the fifth-generation pony car is grossly underrated and takes mods incredibly well. Meanwhile, the bowtie crowd will laugh in small block V8 at the idea such a thing could hold a candle to America’s sports car. However, when your Z06 blows up during a race, all of this really doesn’t matter."

We don’t have specs, but we do know he was running the car on E85 and had a 200 shot of nitrous. In other words, it was an aggressive setup. But we don’t know what the S197 Mustang was running, just that it was turbocharged."

When it went to the 6th it hit the rev limiter and the nitrous was still spraying.” That’s when all hell broke loose, the engine blew, and the Chevy caught fire."

We’re not endorsing street racing at all: it’s a dangerous, selfish, and stupid thing to do. But boy do we love seeing someone blow up their car while trying to show off."

It really does illustrate how dangerous drag racing on public roads is, but we know there are still some people who think it’s cool or better than going to a track. There are a couple of drag strip incidents thrown in there, too, before anyone thinks racing on a track means there are no dangers, just that you won’t kill a whole family coming back from visiting grandma."
