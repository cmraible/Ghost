After all, the average transaction price in India was paltry, plus for likely a myriad of reasons the brand really didn’t appeal to shoppers there. Pulling back on focuses on the home turf in North America was the smart sensible thing to do, and thankfully it was what company brass chose. That paid off big as sales on this continent surged 43 percent for Q2."

That wasn’t from a sales success anywhere else, proving that focusing on the home turf is vital for Harley moving forward."

Just keep in mind Harley will have to stay on its toes and innovate even as it relies on premium offerings and nostalgia, because the ground is shifting under everyone quite a bit these days."
