<p>Time can do horrible things to automobiles, and this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/184129/1950-ford-custom-2-door-sedan" rel="nofollow">1950 Ford</a> is proof. After years of sitting, this car was rescued from its slumber, and now it awaits an enthusiast ready to take on an intense restoration. There's no denying the fact that this Shoebox will need a lot of work, but at least all of the major parts are all still there.</p>

<p>Even in its rough condition, this old Shoebox has a cool look to it. If it wasn't for the rotted floorboards and rusted rocker panels, this Ford would actually have a neat patina to it. Adding a little extra personality, the missing hood and headlight gives this neglected car a look similar to Mater the tow truck from <em>Cars</em>.</p>
<p>Without a hood, the non-running 239 CID V8 is hanging out for all to see, and this engine is paired to a three-speed manual transmission with a column-mounted shifter. Although it retains all its windows, the interior has suffered just as much as the rest of the car with water and exposure damage visible on the seats, headliner and floor, but again, this is a mostly complete car.</p>
<p>Unlike some barn finds, this Ford is still a viable project as it wasn't disassembled before being parked to rot away. Many of us have always dreamed about saving a classic or vintage car from a similar fate, and this is your chance!</p>
