          "Two Top Fuel drivers for the NHRA, Dominick Lagana and Richie Crampton, were both seriously injured in an accident involving a 1957 Chevrolet Station Wagon not far from Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis. The turbocharged LS-powered '57 Chevy Wagon was built by Crampton and his friend Jonnie Lindberg to compete in Hot Rod's Drag Week. On Sunday evening, Lagana, 34, was piloting the '57 Chevy when, for reasons unknown, the car left the road and smashed into a utility pole."

Sources also said that Crampton suffered a broken hip after he was ejected from the car, and they said that Lagana is in critical condition after suffering life-threatening injuries from the accident and is currently on a ventilator. There was another person in the vehicle, 30-year-old Jake Sanders, who is being treated at a nearby hospital for his injuries."

For reasons unknown, the wagon restomod went off the west side of the road and made contact with a utility pole, as mentioned above. According to Captain Amanda Goings from the Hendricks County Sheriff's Office, the wreck is still being investigated but speed is believed to have been a big factor."
