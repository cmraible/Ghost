<p>Restomod cars present a great opportunity for their creators to not only improve upon the original model, but also put their own stamp on it. However, it’s often all too easy to create a polarizing machine that’s hard to admire. That’s not the case with this 1948 Ford Coupe offered by <a href="https://www.classiccarliquidators.com/vehicles/2507/1948-ford-coupe-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Classic Car Liquidators</a>, as its author has real taste.</p>
<p>Respecting Ford’s original design, this restored car doesn’t look much modified from stock at first glance — it even sports original paint. It retains that proud hood and the model’s flared wheel arches, and leaves the coupe profile as intended. The first hint that not all is as it seem comes from those red wheels and a squatted ride hight.</p>

<p>All of the magic has taken place out of public view, with serious mechanical changes beneath the skin. Lift the hood to reveal a 5.7-liter LS1 V8 motor of an unspecified output, courtesy of rival General Motors. We’re willing to bet that this classic’s new heart gives it an impressive power-to-weight ratio.</p>

<p>New TCI independent front suspension, four-link rear suspension, and Ride Tech HQ coilovers contributes to the drop in ride hight, but primarily serve to boost handling. A set of wide BF Goodrich Silvertown radial tires deliver some modern rubber while maintaining a vintage whitewall look. Other improvements include a new EFI tank and wiring harness.</p>
<p>Open the passenger doors to show off the more visual element of the custom work undertaken, a bespoke interior. The polished tilting steering wheel is presented to the driver ahead of a beautifully crafted dashboard. A set of Dakota VXH digital gauges preserve the instrumentation’s vintage look, while providing more information to the driver. Upholstered in grey leather with red trim, the craftsman ship appears impeccable.</p>
<p>This refined restomod has covered just over 41,000 miles, with plenty more to give. The asking price for the 1948 model is $44,999.</p>
