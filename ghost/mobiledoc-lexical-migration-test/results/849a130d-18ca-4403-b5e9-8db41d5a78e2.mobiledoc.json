          "'s gameplay is what makes it so unique. Being forced into a seemingly endless loop doesn't sound appealing at first but as the hero reshapes the world in his image, it all seems to come together. The most interesting aspect is the concept of finding the balance between upgrading your hero and the player balancing the difficulty; the latter centres around the autonomy that the player has to place tiles around the road that summons enemies - by default, one would think to simply not summon enemies, however doing so allows you to collect resources to build up and upgrade your town (which provides you in-game bonuses and abilities) and gives you more equipment to upgrade your character in the run. The idea is to get strong enough to defeat the boss and yet, you don't want to make it too difficult where you won't even make it to the boss. It's a balancing act which takes a lot of strategic planning."

The pixel art does wonderful shading work whilst purposely adopting a not-so-pixel-perfect approach.

Its implementation of touchscreen works well for shifting around environment tiles (as moving the cursor around with the left joystick is cumbersome) and icons for command options and menu navigation are quite small and awkwardly placed (making simple button commands on the controller the better way to go). If you're exclusively playing in handheld mode (with the Switch Lite, for example), you'll likely find yourself awkwardly fumbling with the console as you go from buttons to touchscreen and if you're playing docked, well, you better get used to that cursor control."
