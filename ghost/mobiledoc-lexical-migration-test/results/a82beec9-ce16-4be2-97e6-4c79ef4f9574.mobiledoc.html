<p>GM has been one of the biggest participants in the Indy pace car program. With the exception of the few years that another automaker got involved,  every year GM would put its best foot forward helping to kick off one of the biggest racing events in the US and hoping to get the attention of the public. One of the most used models is the Camaro and one of the most popular is the first generation examples of the model. Although a 1967 model is probably the rarest, the 1969 Camaro Pace Car is an icon.</p>

<p>2018 was a historical year for Dodge, the introduction of the Demon cemented the Mopar name into the minds of younger car enthusiasts. This particular Demon makes its presence known by sporting one of the most flamboyant colors that the car was offered in. Taking things up a notch, the Demon yawns at the 707 horsepower of the Hellcat while itself makes an insane 840-horsepower when equipped with the one-dollar optional Demon crate. Another thing that makes the Demon so popular is the fact that Dodge was able to push the car to a 9.65-second quarter-mile.</p>

<p>It is not really all that surprising that car restorers have turned to restomodding as somewhat of an industry standard. The very concept, though completely unnatural, seems somewhat natural in a very strange way. If you think about it, who would have ever thought that a large portion of the remaining cars from the 1970s would have fuel injection, independent suspension, and rack and pinion steering and yet at the same time it is very fitting that a restorer would want to add the best features of the modern world to their favorite classic body style.</p>

<p>Chevrolet changed the course of history in 1955 and revamped their brand with the introduction of the newly redesigned Bel Air. It featured an all new, almost futuristic look that had the ability to make the average American feel as though they were driving a much more expensive Cadillac. Available as a hardtop, convertible, or Nomad wagon the new Chevrolet was truly a car for everyone. So much so that Chevy ended up garnering a whopping 44-percent of the low-priced market segment.</p>
