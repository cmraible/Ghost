The red-on-red color combinations add an even sportier presence to this ZR-1, and the interior still has protective plastic on the seats and the Monroney sticker taped to the windshield. This car is so original that it still has the wheels and tires that it came rolled off the assembly line with! Bottom line, while the ZR-1 was built for the track, this low-mileage survivor is destined for a museum."

Its 375-horsepower output eclipsed the 245-horsepower rating of a base 1990 Corvette, and it received a unique look thanks to a wider rear that was necessary to accommodate the massive rear wheels and tires. The 1990 model year was the only year that the ZR-1 had the squared-off front end, and the ZR-1's distinctive rounded rear bumper was eventually added to all 1991 Corvettes."
