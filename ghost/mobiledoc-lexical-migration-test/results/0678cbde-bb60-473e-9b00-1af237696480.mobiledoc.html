<p>We'll start big, with a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/186535/1988-ferrari-testarossa">1988 Ferrari Testarossa</a>. To many, this is the ultimate 1980s exotic. What can we say about the Testarossa that hasn't been said already?</p>
<p>The wide, wedge body, the cheese-grater strakes along the side, the pop-up headlights...even the wheels are iconic. This car is simply unmistakable.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, Testarossas are surprisingly affordable, considering their pedigree. You can buy this one from <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/186535/1988-ferrari-testarossa">GR Auto Gallery</a> for just under $100,000.</p>

<p>The basic design of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/212250/1984-porsche-911-carrera-3-2">the Porsche 911</a> dates back to the early 1960s, and the impact bumper facelift came along in the 1970s. Regardless, the Porsche 911 is inextricably linked to the 1980s.</p>
<p>The car seen here is a beautiful metallic black 1984. That means it's the first year of the 3.2 Carrera, with a larger engine than the outgoing 911 SC that utilized Bosch Motronic fuel injection.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/carrera2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1440" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/carrera2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/carrera2.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/carrera2.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/carrera2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>That fuel injection system aided performance, reliability, and fuel economy – a killer trifecta by anyone's standards. In fact, Bosch Motronic is partially responsible for Porsche's amazing 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans in 1984.</p>
<p>This car was subtly modified at the factory, and was used as a company car by a Porsche employee when new. You can find this beautiful, one-of-a-kind 911 Carrera at <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/212250/1984-porsche-911-carrera-3-2">Reimel Motor Cars</a> for just under $160,000.</p>

<p>We've been looking at some high-dollar exotic machinery today. Let's take a step back and look at a car that's considerably less expensive, but still quite exotic.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/179630/1986-chevrolet-corvette-coupe">1986 Chevrolet Corvette</a> coupe has all of the right options – the Z51 performance package, the clear targa top, and the excellent (for its day) Delco Bose stereo. Don't worry about the seats getting too hot in the summer – they're cloth, another rare option.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/c42.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1210" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/c42.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/c42.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/c42.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/c42.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>Speaking of rare options, this Corvette's yellow paint makes it pretty rare. Usually, when we see a yellow '86 Corvette, it's a convertible.</p>
<p>C4 Corvettes may not get much respect now, but when they were new, they could run circles around much more expensive machinery for thousands less – often tens of thousands less. That's still true today. You can find this Corvette at <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/179630/1986-chevrolet-corvette-coupe">Classic Auto Mall</a> for $13,500.</p>

<p>Our final selection is indeed a Lamborghini, but it's not the vaunted Countach. No, instead, we found an example of its smaller sibling, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/189565/1987-lamborghini-jalpa">the Jalpa</a>.</p>
<p>Just 410 Jalpas were produced. This 1987 example falls near the end of the line. It's in gorgeous condition, with shimmering pearl white paint and a bright red interior.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/jalpa2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1900" height="1209" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/jalpa2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/jalpa2.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/jalpa2.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/12/jalpa2.jpg 1900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

</figure>
<p>Jalpas were powered by a 255 horsepower 3.5 liter DOHC V8. The Jalpa competed with cars like the Ferrari 328 and the Porsche 911.</p>
<p>This example can be yours for just $85,000. If this '80s dream machine speaks to you, ring up the folks at <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/189565/1987-lamborghini-jalpa">Charles S. Crail Automobiles</a>, and tell them that Motorious sent you.</p>
