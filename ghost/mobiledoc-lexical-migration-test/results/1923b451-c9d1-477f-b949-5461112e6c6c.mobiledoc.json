He’d seen the rather large collection of these you can see on the wall in our office.\n\n“Yup, we’re killing the trees,” said Karl.\n\nGiven the news earlier in the week that [deforestation is responsible for more global warming than air travel](http://andrewkbrown.wordpress.com/2007/02/01/fact-of-the-morning/), I can’t help wondering whether the slow death of the published magazine at the hands of the internet might not be a good thing, at least in terms of the environment.\n\nOr is the production of all the technology and energy needed to sustain an online communications infrastructure more damaging than print publishing ever was?\n\n\n"
