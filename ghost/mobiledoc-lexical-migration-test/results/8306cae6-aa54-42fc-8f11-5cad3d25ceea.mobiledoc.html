<p>One month ago, Save Our Healthcare entered the scene, marking the latest in a string of dark money groups targeting congressional Democrats and their economic, health care, and climate reconciliation package.</p>
<p>Save Our Healthcare appears to be among the darkest of dark money groups. It’s difficult to paint a clear picture of who’s behind the operation, allowing the organization to skirt public scrutiny.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>A new dark money group called <a href="https://saveusahealthcare.com/">Save Our Healthcare</a> has spent nearly $150,000 on digital ads this month targeting congressional Democrats, disparaging the party’s plan to hike corporate taxes and reform health care.</p>
<p>“Do you dare enter America’s haunted hospital?” one Halloween-themed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&id=391931899241696&view_all_page_id=102318922223063&search_type=page&media_type=all">ad</a> asks viewers, urging them to tell their lawmakers “to keep this socialist nightmare in Pelosi's dreams.” The nightmare? Democrats’ budget reconciliation package that Save Our Healthcare claims “will harm patients, limit access to lifesaving treatments, and completely halt medical innovations — all while killing jobs and slowing America’s economic recovery from the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Little is known about Save Our Healthcare, among the darkest of dark money groups, since it has completely flown under the radar since its incorporation in Delaware <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/de/save-our-healthcare-inc.html">on September 27</a>. The group has been running digital ads for the better part of October, but it does not appear to have made any television ad buys that would require the group to disclose the identities of people involved with the effort to the Federal Communications Commission.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>While it’s unclear who is behind the operation, we have a few hints about its origins. The group’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&id=391931899241696&view_all_page_id=102318922223063&search_type=page&media_type=all">Facebook ad disclaimer</a> lists a Massachusetts address shared by <a href="https://www.redcurve.com/services/compliance">Red Curve Solutions</a>, a Republican campaign finance management and compliance firm. Bradley T. Crate, <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00762591/1471958/">campaign treasurer</a> for former President Donald Trump with <a href="https://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4uKagy0oyMA/LepVZLGvx4PDLRGW0IX7r">longstanding ties</a> to Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, heads up the company. According to a 2016 <a href="https://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/local-company-assists-trump/article_503f128f-6b62-586a-bd9e-e3beabfc566d.html">article</a> by <em>The Salem News</em>, “Red Curve Solutions raked in $1.1 million by the Trump for President Committee, $510,000 by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, and $490,000 by the Trump Victory Committee.”</p>
<p>For now, that’s all we know about Save Our Healthcare, one of several shadowy groups that are being launched by political operatives to sink the progressives’ agenda for the sake of their corporate and conservative masters. It’s very scary indeed.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>On October 16, 2015, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., then chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and chief architect of the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, wrote to then-Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000150-81e6-ddfb-a3f0-97fe287c0000">scolding the Arizona Democrat</a> for misrepresenting him in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/depoliticizing-elizabeth-warrens-pet-project-1444861338">opinion piece</a> she had co-authored with Texas Republican Congressman Randy Neugebauer about the structure of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which had been created by the Dodd-Frank Act.</p>
<p>In the op-ed, Sinema and Neugebauer advocated for a five-person bipartisan commission to run the CFPB, rather than a single independent director — an idea they claimed was held by Frank, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and the Obama administration. “A single-director structure solidifies the policy positions of the political party in charge of the White House,” Sinema and her co-author noted, adding: “A bipartisan commission allows for greater diversity of viewpoints, forcing more dialogue and a more balanced approach to rule-making.”</p>
<p>Frank fired back in his letter to Sinema, slamming her for doing Wall Street’s bidding by lying about his and Warren’s strong preference for a sole director, since a single person in charge would let the agency be <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/banking-industrys-attempt-weaken-cfpb_b_8340792">more nimble and definitive</a> in responding to threats to consumers.</p>
<p>“I strongly disagree with you on this,” wrote Frank, “and I assume you know that your allies on this are overwhelmingly those who do not want any CFPB at all, while supporters of the Bureau in and out of Congress believe that your position would diminish its effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Regarding how he’d been misrepresented, Frank added, “I am not surprised when right-wing Republicans do this, but disappointed that you joined them in this tactic.” After all, Sinema was a true-blue Democrat — who could imagine she would do anything to complicate her own party’s agenda?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong><strong>BELTWAY JOUR</strong>NO<strong>S SCORE ALONE TIME WITH MANCHIN:</strong></strong>On Monday night, Virginia Senator Joe Manchin spoke at an off-the-record event with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's top business lobbying group. <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1452995754314936320/photo/2">Several</a> prominent Capitol Hill journalists were present, ostensibly <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1452995754314936320">hanging on Manchin’s every word</a>, yet nothing of substance was reported on why the corporate Democrat is leading the plot to massively water down the Biden Administration’s Build Back Better social spending package. The pointless tidbits that <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshNBCNews/status/1452833331935076361">did land in the Twittersphere</a>? Manchin is out of sync with his party, he loves Republicans, and he is “just trying to survive.” Poor guy!</li>
    <li><strong>DEMS DELIVER ON BOEBERT GOAL:</strong> Democrats are <a href="https://twitter.com/JarrettRenshaw/status/1452717098061422592?s=20">likely to kill their own proposal</a> to impose a methane fee on U.S. oil and gas producers from the budget reconciliation package. Just last month, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/boeberts-anti-climate-self-enrichment-scheme/">we wrote about</a> how Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) was aiding fossil fuel industry lobbyists in their push to weaken climate policy, in order to enrich her husband’s fossil fuel business.. It looks like the Democrats’ intra-party fighting may allow Boebert to get her wish, since one of her proposed <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II00/20210909/114022/BILLS-117-CommitteePrint-B000825-Amdt-1.pdf">amendments</a> would have removed the provision subjecting fossil fuel companies to new fees when their fracking operations emit methane.</li>
    <li><strong>BIG TECH PUTS PROFIT OVER CHILDRENS’ PRIVACY:</strong> New unredacted documents from an antitrust lawsuit expose <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/google-kids-privacy-protections-tech-giants-516834">Google’s coordination with fellow tech giants</a> in 2019 to slow federal action on strengthening the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., a champion of the legislation to protect kids’ privacy, said of the finding, “Big Tech and its army of lobbyists are working hard to block Congress’ efforts to enact privacy legislation because it would cost them money.” He added, “Even when it comes to children, these companies put their bottom line before their users’ well-being." Unsealed documents from the filing by Texas’ Attorney General and attorneys general from 14 other states and Puerto Rico also detail Google and Facebook’s alleged collusion to <a href="https://twitter.com/Sludge/status/1452321505736601604">control the online ad market</a>, a strategy the companies nicknamed  “Jedi Blue.” Read more about those documents <a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1452053938195341314?t=h4LSeMr1FhKvC6WBCFxGZg&s=19">here</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>HOUSE DEMS’ SECRET GROUP PLEASES CORPORATE DONORS: </strong>House Democrats’ Steering and Policy Committee, which is responsible for deciding how to fill most committee seats, has <a href="https://readsludge.com/2021/10/21/the-secretive-group-steering-the-dems/">maintained secrecy</a> by avoiding releasing its member roster and rules to the public. “This secretive process was thrust into the spotlight last year when New Democrat Coalition member Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., was given a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee over progressive member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,” <em>Sludge</em> reports. Committee membership is crucial to federal policymaking, as evidenced by Rice’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/follow-the-pharma-money/">House committee vote</a> last month to do away with a proposal allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>PRIVATE EQUITY DAMPENS LOCAL CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: </strong></strong>A new <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=564097067103025119098122082096012066055084000087056003103000080014073101098099121124007057116106052004021005076022000091083099103052022029022005019118088123094088006090060086020127067086093084089008113086000064073084103114116088028106117088017121025110&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE">analysis</a> details how private equity firm buyouts of daily newspapers have shifted content toward national issues and away from local matters, ultimately depressing voter turnout and public awareness of local politicians. “This civic engagement result is unambiguously negative, as voter knowledge of local policy issues and participation in the political process are crucial for local government accountability and, ultimately, a functioning democracy,” note the paper’s authors.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>AMAZON SHORTCHANGES WORKERS WHILE MAKING RECORD PROFITS: </strong></strong>Amazon has been underpaying many employees for at least a year and a half while amassing record profits, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/technology/amazon-employee-leave-errors.html?searchResultPosition=1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Findings from a confidential internal report revealed that “Amazon had been shortchanging new parents, patients dealing with medical crises, and other vulnerable workers on leave,” with as many as 180 Amazon facilities potentially affected by incorrect pay calculations. Worse yet, some employees experiencing health issues and crises were fired when Amazon software <a href="https://twitter.com/jodikantor/status/1452407850303635467">wrongly marked them</a> as no-shows, leaving workers with lost income while they waited months to return to their jobs. According to a company spokesperson, Amazon is still working on repaying workers.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>PRIVATIZING IOWA MEDICAID HAS HURT RECIPIENTS:</strong></strong>A new state audit shows Iowa’s privatized Medicaid system has <a href="https://www.kwwl.com/news/politics/auditor-iowas-privatized-medicaid-illegally-denies-care/article_84921f91-3625-516b-b335-9de525e6232d.html">illegally denied care</a> to program beneficiaries. The report, which covers the time period from 2013 to 2019, reveals that the state program’s shift to management by two private insurance companies increased unlawful denials of care by 891 percent and violated a contract with the state by allowing members to go without basic services like bathing and wound care. <br></li>
