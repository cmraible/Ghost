<hr>
<p>Based in Cleveland, Ohio, the Winton Motor Carriage Company was a pioneering in United States automobile manufacturing. If there were generations considered of cars back then, this <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/hf21/hershey/lots/r0116-1904-winton-20hp-rear-entrance-tonneau/1168214?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=HF21">1904 Winton 20hp Rear-Entrance Tonneau</a> would represent the kickoff of the second run/series of the Winston cars. This rare survivor is up for grabs through RM Sothebys, and classic collectors should not let this example slip by!</p>

<p>The current owners of <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/hf21/hershey/lots/r0116-1904-winton-20hp-rear-entrance-tonneau/1168214?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=HF21">this 1904 Winton</a> 20hp Rear-Entrance Tonneau bought the car from its British owner, who was the one who was able to date the car. This example is said to have had its fair share of journey and following engine trouble on the annual London-to-Brighton Emancipation Run, it was returned to the United States and got an engine rebuild under the care of Charlie Wake, a great-grandson of Alexander Winton.</p>
