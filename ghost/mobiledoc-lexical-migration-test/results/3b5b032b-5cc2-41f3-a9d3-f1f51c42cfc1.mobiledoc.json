The custom auto shop was usually a place where customers’ dreams were made reality, contrasting sharply with the grisly triple homicide which eventually went cold. However, authorities now believe they have their man and prosecutors will have their shot in court for the suspect to be found guilty."

The first break came in October 2006 when Darryl Krogman told FBI agents he was with Kersh when the man bought a .22-caliber handgun at a show months before the murders. What’s more, he said Kersh asked him to make a silencer for the firearm not too long after."

Often, victims of close-contact crimes are able to scratch their killer while defending themselves, leaving behind evidence. The conclusion was that the DNA could have come from Kersh, who “could not be excluded as a contributor to the genetic material.”"
