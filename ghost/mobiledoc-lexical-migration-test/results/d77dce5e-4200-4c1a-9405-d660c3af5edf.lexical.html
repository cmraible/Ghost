<hr>
<p>Prices have skyrocketed for the first-generation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-redesigns-the-first-gen-ford-bronco/">Ford Bronco</a> in recent years, and that will continue to happen when Ford introduces its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-ford-bronco-reveal/">all-new sixth-gen Bronco on July 9th</a>. Fortunately, the big-body <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/marooned-in-wilderness-1975-ford-bronco/">Broncos</a> (built from 1978 through 1996) are still readily available – and usually at decent prices – for buyers looking for a classic SUV that is rugged and increasingly collectible. The basic design of these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2022-ford-bronco-wildtrak/">Broncos</a> didn't change all that much over the years, so here's a quick rundown of the four generations of big-body Broncos (not including the compact 1984-90 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford/Bronco%20II">Bronco II</a>, of course).</p>
<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/1978-1979/Ford/Bronco"><strong>Second Generation (1978-79)</strong></a></p>

<p>After 11 years of production for the original Bronco, the second-gen body only last for two years as Ford switched to the larger F-Series platform to compete against the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Blazer">Chevy Blazer</a>, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/dodge/ramcharger">Dodge Ramcharger</a>, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Jeep/Cherokee">Jeep Cherokee</a> (SJ) and <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/International/Scout%20II">International Scout II</a>. The 1978 model year was the only year for this body with round headlights (square on the Ranger trim), but for the most part, they were identical to the Ford pickup trucks. and featured a removable roof over the rear seats. Unlike the completely removable top from the original Bronco, this model and the subsequent designs only had a removable roof over the rear seats.</p>

<p>An all-new F-Series debuted in 1980, and the Bronco was updated as well with a more squared-off body and reintroduced a straight-six engine. This generation was also the last Bronco to have the iconic bucking horse emblem on the front fenders (1982), and it was the first to offer the Eddie Bauer trim level (in 1985).</p>

<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/1987-1991/Ford/Bronco"><strong>Fourth Generation (1987-91)</strong></a></p>

<p>Following the introduction of the eight-generation F-Series pickup in 1987, the Bronco was redesigned for its fourth generation. Some of the highlights for this generation include the first-ever leather interior offered on a Bronco (1991) and a new Nite special edition with an all-black paint job and contrasting blue/purple body graphics.</p>

<p>The redesigned fifth-generation Bronco debuted in 1992, and it once again combined the styling of the coinciding F-Series with a modified version of this pickup's platform that was used for the original big-body Bronco. These Broncos added even more luxury and style, but they also featured a top that was now much more difficult (although not impossible) to remove. When Ford introduced its tenth-generation F-Series in 1997, the four-door Expedition replaced the Bronco.</p>
