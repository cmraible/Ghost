Venture round to the door jam and a highly original service sticker from Quaker State Motor Oil remains in exceptional condition. Step inside and the factory original user guide for the transfer case is still as clear as day on the sun visor above the driver. It’s features like these that usually get eroded by the sands of time, but somehow are preserved to perfection on this ‘64 example."
