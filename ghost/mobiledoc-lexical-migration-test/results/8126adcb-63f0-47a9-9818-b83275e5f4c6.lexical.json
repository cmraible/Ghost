This police pursuit went down with the Arkansas State Police in what looks to be at least a somewhat rural area. That’s key if a suspect wants to try going dark in a chase, since too many streetlights will ruin such a gambit. The same thing is true if the car is a light color. Also thrown in the mix is the strategy of going slow to not get caught by the cops, like the guy was applying what he thought was Taoism to driving, and it turns out about how you’d expect.",

With a 392 under the hood, this guy should be able to lose a run-of-the-mill cop car with ease.
