As you could imagine, the extent of wear and tear on most hearses is usually limited to being parked for extended periods of time, and that definitely seems to be the case with this Caddy. According to the listing, this 42-year-old classic is a one-owner car that has just 32,000 actual miles, and it comes loaded with luxury amenities such as the plush leather seats."
