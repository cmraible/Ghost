While the actual campaign hasn’t launched, it looks like the whole thing is to discourage street takeovers, street racing, and other reckless maneuvers on public roads. That’s great and all, but the influencers decided to use some behind-the-scenes footage and photos to create a dumb hoax about how they’d all been arrested while filming for their YouTube channels."

Digging into their pasts, I think you’ll find they were either incredibly lucky in some previous/current business venture or they have rich parents. Yet these lovely individuals have no qualms at all selling the lie to their gullible followers."

They seem like they’re down-to-earth, regular guys, but their personas, their wardrobes, and everything else they show to the masses is carefully crafted. Just like so-called “reality TV” nothing about what they do is genuine or real, or at least very little is."

Why don’t these same fans call out their beloved icons for destroying rare, desirable vehicles in the pursuit of gaining more clicks? That’s odd behavior for a supposed gearhead."

          "I’m not saying you can’t or shouldn’t follow any automotive personalities on social media – after all, I do. It’s just that there seem to be two types: those who manufacture drama and act more like the Kardashians and those who obviously are just sharing their passion with the world. A quick test of which type a certain person on social media might be to question if they mostly talk/post about themselves or about other things? If they themselves are the focus of their social media activities, which is often the case with true “influencers”, then I would argue you’re dealing with a fraud. Consume what you want, but I believe it’s best to know when you’re being actively deceived with a fairy tale life that doesn’t really exist since reality is a better place to live."
