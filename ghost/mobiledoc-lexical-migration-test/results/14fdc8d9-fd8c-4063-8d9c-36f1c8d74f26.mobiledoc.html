<p>Many have lamented that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gt-r50-by-italdesign/">mighty Nissan GT-R</a> has become far too expensive these days. After all, the starting price of a 2020 starts at $113,540. If you want the thrilling performance of a Nismo model it’ll cost you dearly at $210,740 and your firstborn. For that kind of money you can get some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-gtr-rendering/">pretty crazy vehicles</a>, not to say the GT-R Nismo is some pushover. But <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1989-nissan-skyline-gtr-restoration-video/">Godzilla</a> used to stand for attainable, affordable performance. That’s where this 2012 Nissan GT-R Black Edition comes into play.</p>

<p>With a mere 21,350 miles it’s essentially like getting a new car even though it’s 8 years-old. Lest you think that because of its age this Nissan isn’t that impressive, keep in mind the twin-turbo 3.8-liter V6 makes a mighty 530-horsepower. That, combined with all-wheel drive, makes this R35 a quick and highly rewarding car to take on any road or track.</p>

<p>In fact, this is a performance vehicle which offers real comfort for the passengers while the driver’s entertained. They’re not going to feel like they’re getting thrown around, thanks to designs like cast-aluminum front shock towers with a carbon-fiber brace with a honeycomb core, extra bracing behind the bulkhead, etc. For some that kind of livability is key to making a purchase decision.</p>

<p>Some will tell you the R35 isn’t as worthy of a GT-R as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/wrangle-godzilla-with-this-2001-nissan-skyline-gt-r/">R34</a> or even the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/enjoy-affordable-performance/">R33</a>. That’s certainly a matter of opinion, but consider this: some auto journalists have been able to get the 2012 model moving from 0-60 in under 3 seconds. That’s undeniably quick, but just over 3 seconds might be more realistic, which is still impressive.</p>
