          " for their 1966 rental program. Available to those 25 and older and offered at $17/ day and 17 cents per mile, the Hertz model differed little from the standard Shelby offering.  Both claimed 306 horsepower. The “Rent a Racers” came with a “higher” gear ratio which lowered the rpm at speed.  The first 84 sported four-speeds and Holley carburetors. Subsequent Hertz cars had automatics and were fed by an Autolite 4100 carburetor. Sapphire Blue, Candy Apple Red, and Ivey Green adorned the rental cars but the most common and memorable livery was Raven Black with Gold stripes as pictured below.  This one has undergone a recent frame up restoration and is fitted with a period correct Shelby badged Paxton Supercharger."
