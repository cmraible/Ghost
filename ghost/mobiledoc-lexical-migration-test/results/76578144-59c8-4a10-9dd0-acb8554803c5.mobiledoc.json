When it’s not Ford, GM, and Mopar fans trashing each other, it’s fans of American muscle cars smack talking with fans of JDM cars. To many American performance nuts, Japanese cars are weak. However, you have to keep in mind that not all JDMs are Toyota Corollas."

Now, mentioning those two cars drag racing each other would make pretty much anyone laugh, because the Chevelle was built for that kind of duty so it should win no problem. However, both of these cars are pretty heavily modified. In fact, while the Chevelle is pushing 550-horsepower, the R32 Godzilla makes 650-hp. Yikes."

Also, he can’t even get through the gears correctly. Of course, this isn’t even close to a formal drag race, so before people start complaining we know that and aren’t saying all JDM cars are faster than all muscle cars – that would be stupid."

It’s a close race and we can’t tell who won, but the Audi had a slight edge off the line. Still, if given a choice between the two, we’d want the Chevelle in our garage."
