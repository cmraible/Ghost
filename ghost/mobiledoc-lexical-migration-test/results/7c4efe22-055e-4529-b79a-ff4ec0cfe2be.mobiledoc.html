<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/2018-dodge-challenger-srt-demon?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=sb2mar">Dodge released the Demon</a>, immediately breaking a multitude of production car records. It was the first ever production car to be built with the capabilities that it has and to use the technology that it does. The secret behind <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/2018-dodge-challenger-srt-demon?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=sb2mar">the Demon</a> is more than just an 840-horsepower supercharged engine. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/2018-dodge-challenger-srt-demon?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=sb2mar">Dodge utilized</a> a special engine programming system to allow the car to selectively run on high octane fuel for maximum power output, included the largest factory hood scoop to increase airflow, and designed the transmission to have a trans brake and torque reserve technology which has also never before been done. The result is the world’s fastest, hardest launching passenger car ever made. It is capable of a 0-60 sprint in just 2.3-seconds at 1.8 Gs of force and its 9.65 second ET at 140-mph led the NHRA to officially ban it from competition.</p>
