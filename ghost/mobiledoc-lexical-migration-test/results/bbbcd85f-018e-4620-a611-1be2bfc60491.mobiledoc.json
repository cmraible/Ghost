          "First, let’s get back to the rugged and capable nature of this truck. Right off the bat you should note the Warn winch mounted on the front, perfect for helping recover lesser 4x4s but hopefully not yourself, but you have it there just in case. Two big D-rings on either side of the winch are perfect anchor points, too. A brush guard helps protect that nice yellow paint from damage on the trail, while roof lights provide additional illumination if you stay out past sunset. There’s even a massive rooftop basket for you to strap down all kinds of gear, because room is in no shortage."

There’s also a built-in PlayStation 2 system plus a nice aftermarket sound system with plenty of speakers to provide hours of fun wherever you go. As you can see in the pictures, there’s a CB radio, which can really come in handy, plus leather seats which are a cinch to clean up after you go out adventuring. A covered cargo area which is massive is perfect for bringing along Fido or gear your don’t want to get dirty."
