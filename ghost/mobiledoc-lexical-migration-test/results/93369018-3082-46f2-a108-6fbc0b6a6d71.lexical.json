This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.</p>\n<p>— Twitter (@twitter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/378261932148416512\">September 12, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we don&#8217;t know much yet about how much the company looks to raise in its IPO as the S-1 hasn&#8217;t been made public at this time, we expect Twitter to go public at a valuation of between $15 and $20 billion.  This assumption is based on the fact its last round of private money came in at around a $10 billion valuation, and those investors will obviously want a return on their investment.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll keep you updated as we learn more. By the way, Facebook&#8217;s IPO valued the social networking giant at $100 billion.</p>\n"
