<p> Say the words "<a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4717/1962-chevrolet-bel-air-409-bubbletop?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Chevrolet Bel Air</a>," and most folks think of the iconic 1957 model. However, the early Sixties models, in all of their bubble-topped goodness, have a devoted following as well with a diverse range of enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Fans of factory-original restored classics, street rods, lowriders, and donks can't agree on much, but they can almost universally agree on the '59 to '62 Chevy. After <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4717/1962-chevrolet-bel-air-409-bubbletop?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">looking at this one</a>, you can count us in that crowd, too.</p>

That unique golden brown color must have something to do with it.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4717/1962-chevrolet-bel-air-409-bubbletop?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the auction listing</a>, that color is House of Kolor Root Beer over a Tangerine base. That orange basecoat brightens up the brown without washing it out. It's a deep, rich color unlike anything we've ever seen before.</p>
<p>The lasting also states that <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4717/1962-chevrolet-bel-air-409-bubbletop?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this car</a> was built by Pro Comp Customs, the company responsible for finishing many of the cars used in The Fast and the Furious movies. This car definitely has that look to it – it wouldn't look out of place with Vin Diesel behind the wheel.</p>
