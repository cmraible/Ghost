With this setup, the car generates 550-horsepower and 500 lb/ft of torque and is shifted via a Ricardo 6-speed manual transmission. Functional rear scoops feed air into the hungry engine, and a helical limited-slip differential transfers the power to the ground. A stiff construction is necessary for a car of this caliber, so the car was given a lightweight aluminum space frame and body."

Big Brembo four-piston aluminum brake calipers work in conjunction with cross-drilled and vented rotors do the job with ease. Alloy BBS wheels (18-inch front, 19-inch rear) wrapped with Goodyear Eagle F1 rubber sit on all four corners.
