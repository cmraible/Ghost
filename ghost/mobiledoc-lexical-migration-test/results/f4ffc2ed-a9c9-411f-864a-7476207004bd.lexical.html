<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I know you get a lot of email, but please — take two minutes to read this whole note, because it is important.</p>
<p>This week, a landmark climate report shows that we are living through one of the most perilous moments in human history — and corporate media is protecting the politicians perpetrating this disaster. But at the same time, this week’s resignation of Andrew Cuomo shows how independent media is finally moving into a position to fight back and make real change.</p>
<p>We have a choice: We can obediently accept a status quo of corporate media that aids and abets the corruption threatening our survival, or we can pitch in to build a reader-supported media that holds these monsters accountable and gives us a chance for a better world.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose the latter, <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0"><strong>please click here</strong></a> to use this special discount to become a <em>Daily Poster</em> subscriber to help us continue our work.</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>As a reader-supported outlet, we simply cannot keep doing this work without you.</p>
<p>When you subscribe, you get access to our live events, our podcasts, our exclusive weekly content, and our <em>Citizens Guide To Holding The Powerful Accountable</em>. You also help us do the kind of accountability journalism that gets real results.</p>
<p>This week, <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> reporting was <a href="https://twitter.com/ZephyrTeachout/status/1425196631725576192?s=20">widely</a><a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1425463858278322179?s=20">credited</a> with playing a pivotal role in Cuomo’s ultimate demise. While corporate media was celebrating Cuomo last year, we launched an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">investigative series</a> showing how he helped his nursing home industry donors hide a COVID massacre as they made big profits. We were attacked and berated for doing this reporting on such a then-popular politician — but the scandal we helped uncover significantly weakened his grip on power.</p>
<p>It’s the same thing you’ve continued to see from us ever since we launched <em>The Daily Poster </em>a year ago. In the last few weeks alone, we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-scored-real-estate-cash-before-letting-eviction-ban-expire/">exposed</a> House Democrats raking in money from real estate moguls while letting the eviction moratorium expire, we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-boosted-a-pipeline-now-his-aide-could-reap-a-windfall/">exposed</a> a top White House official potentially profiting off Biden boosting an oil pipeline, and we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-pros-and-cons-of-taking-money-from-your-constituents/">exposed</a> Republican efforts to cut off survival benefits to the jobless.</p>
<p>The more of this reporting we do, the more results we will see. But we cannot continue to do so without your help.</p>
