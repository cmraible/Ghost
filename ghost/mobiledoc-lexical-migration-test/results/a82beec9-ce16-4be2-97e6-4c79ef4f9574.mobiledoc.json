This particular Demon makes its presence known by sporting one of the most flamboyant colors that the car was offered in. Taking things up a notch, the Demon yawns at the 707 horsepower of the Hellcat while itself makes an insane 840-horsepower when equipped with the one-dollar optional Demon crate. Another thing that makes the Demon so popular is the fact that Dodge was able to push the car to a 9.65-second quarter-mile."
