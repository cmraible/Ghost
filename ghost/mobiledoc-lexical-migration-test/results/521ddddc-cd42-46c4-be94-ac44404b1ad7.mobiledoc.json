This hyper car is capable of sprinting from zero to 60 mph in only 2.3-seconds, with a top speed of 261 mph. Power is funneled into a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that sends power to all four wheels. The agile chassis is more playful than the Veyron, the predecessor of the Chiron, and it makes easy work of any windy road."

This includes the dynamic handling package, which is intended to give the car even more responsive steering, revised torque vectoring system, stiffer springs, and anti-roll bars. Additionally, the Sport has quad exhaust tips and better aerodynamics. The upgrades enhance the cornering abilities, with the ad noting that the Sport was able to complete the Nardo Ring in  Italy a full five seconds faster than the base model Chiron."
