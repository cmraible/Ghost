<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at TheFrenchDev's Aveliana. The game is slated to release in December 2021 on PC (via Steam) and in regards to a Nintendo Switch version, here's what they had to say:</p>
<blockquote>I really want to make a Switch version for the game, and reaching the main goal and then the stretch goal for it would convince me totally to do it!</blockquote>
<p>Here's the overview:</p>
<blockquote>Embrace Aveliana’s quest to bring back someone she has lost! The game takes place alternatively in an isometric or a 2D point of view and is fast-paced. Guide her through arduous paths watched by monsters, follow the trace of a mysterious fox, and find the powerful artifacts she is looking for at the core of wonderful temples. Will you stealth your way to victory? Seek a forgotten path on the edge of a cliff? Or stand and fight against your enemies? The choice is yours!<br><br>While looking for three artifacts, Aveliana will wander a poetic yet dangerous world and discover about her and her environment! As an indie game developer and following my personal thoughts about our world, I wish to use the videogame as a medium to share and carry meaningful messages. As a scientist, what passionate me the most is how a bunch of atoms can come to live, think, eat, love, etc. Aveliana is a strong and reckless bunch of pixels; she is guided by a fox and she starts to understand who she is thanks to him! The whole artistic design, being minimalistic and poetic, has been thought for you to enter into Aveliana’s story and to live a great experience!</blockquote>

<p>One of TheFrenchDev's inspirations was said to be <em>GRIS</em> and that is very easy to see. It's fine artwork along with its platforming segments brings back a flood of beautiful memories and yet, <em>Aveliana</em> doesn't feel like a carbon copy. It has its own majesty and intrigue, with a mysterious fox that's peaked my curiosity, as well as topdown action segments akin to the classic <em>Legend of Zelda</em> series.</p>
<p>This game requires €12,000 and it is currently sitting at €3,252 after 92 backers with 24 days still remaining. If you’d like to support the development of this game to help it come to Nintendo Switch, click the link below to visit the Kickstarter page.</p>
