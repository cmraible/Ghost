It’s a simple recipe: one midsize two-door coupe or sedan and a seriously large V8 engine. Then, all that was required were a few new paint codes, a few square yards of wild graphics and some home-grown brute force: something Motown had in spades."

Even staid American Motors gave Muscle Cars a shot. But America’s insurance companies heard the muscle car explosion too and moved in for the profits and the kill. A little help from the federal government’s smog cops and some Middle East oil states ended the reign of the muscle car."
