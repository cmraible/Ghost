          "An article published this month by Axios points out a phenomenon we’ve been noticing for a while: car dealerships in America are becoming like dealerships in Europe. More specifically, shoppers here are now growing accustomed to going to a dealer not to buy a new car, truck, or SUV on the spot, but instead to order the exact spec they want. Then, in a month or a few, the vehicle they ordered arrives at the dealership and the customer takes delivery."

          "Not everyone is excited about this new reality, although Axios sure seems to like it. The article argues this European way is more efficient since automakers and dealerships know exactly what customers want and cars are made to order. Sure, people could always order a car from the dealer, but a lot of Americans preferred to just find something which floated their boat and was in stock, then drive it home the same day."

She rightly points out the main reason Americans are willing to pre-order their vehicles right now is because of the “unusual situation” we’re in. However, people on this continent aren’t going to go along with this forever. With a free market, the automakers and dealer networks which cater to the preferences of consumers in the long run will win out, which would mean a return to normal instead of the establishment of a new normal."
