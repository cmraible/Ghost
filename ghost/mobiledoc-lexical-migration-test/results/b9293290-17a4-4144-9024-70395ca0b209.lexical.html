<h2 id="caseys-path-from-verge-to-substack">Casey's path from Verge to Substack.</h2>
<p>The media news of the day is about a big name journalist from the digital sector — Casey Newton of Vox Media’s <em>The Verge —</em> is <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/casey-newton-on-leaving-the-verge-for-substack-and-the-future-of-tech-journalism-974a646375fa">heading off to Substack to launch his new publication</a>. And he’s timed it beautifully for the massive peak of attention he’s generated around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm">a new story about how awful Facebook is</a>. 👌🏻</p>
<p>At some level, it’s a beautiful media moment of the digital age. The first big interview with him is on Medium, of course. He's moving from an online-only pub to his own indie publication. This is the future of journalism developing before our eyes. But aspects of this should make us nervous, too.</p>
<p>There are four broader points worth examining. Let’s dive in.</p><!--members-only-->
<h2 id="1-newsletters-are-rapidly-becoming-a-star-led-business">1. Newsletters are rapidly becoming a star-led business</h2>
<p>There’s a pretty clear trend developing here, isn’t there? The 18 month first phase of “breakout newsletter stars” is over, and we’re now moving into the “star journalist goes indie with a newsletter” phase.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that’s a positive thing because they bring validity to the form and the business model. On the other hand, they run the risk of sucking all the attention — and the subscription cash — out of the market, leaving the smaller players to fight over what’s left.</p>
<p>We’re moving towards a classic fat head/long tail model again, aren’t we?</p>
<h3 id="changing-competition-dynamics">Changing competition dynamics</h3>
<p>However, it’s worth bearing in mind that these big names <em>might</em> be a threat to more established players, too. These star indies don’t need to kill off existing publishers to do them serious harm. I remember starkly how Mike Butcher’s <em>Techcrunch UK</em> — a one man and his laptop operation — ate into <em>Computer Weekly</em>’s attention, traffic and revenue. The title still survives, but it’s a shadow of its former self.</p>
<p>Subscription fatigue is real, and I wonder if people might feel more inclined to shell out their cash to support an indie writer they’ve formed an emotional bond with, rather than the comparatively faceless editorial team of a title from a big publisher.</p>
<p>There’s some interesting thinking to be done on maintaining and enhancing the emotional connection between a title and its readers to stave off that threat, I suspect.</p>
<p><em>(FWIW, and in interests of full disclosure, yes, I’m building my own paid business here, although the newsletter is only part of that. I'mhardly on the star journalist end of the euqation, so you should read my analysis with awareness of that. While my paid subscriber base is growing steadily, it’s still a looooong way from the many hundred I’d need to make this viable as a full-time concern. I don’t really want it to become the only thing I do, though. I love the training and consulting too much. But I would be happy to see it become a comfortable additional revenue stream, to sustain me though unexpected events like, oooh, a global pandemic suddenly pulling the rug from under the face-to-face training business. So, err, tell your friends…?)</em></p>
<h2 id="2-substack-is-winning-the-newsletter-platform-wars">2. Substack is winning the newsletter platform wars</h2>
<p>Newton’s exsiting email, <em>The Interface</em>, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton">runs on Revue</a>. Its successor, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/welcome-to-platformer"><em>Platformer</em>, is running on Substack</a>. That must be a blow to the Revue team, and a big win for the folks at Substack.</p>
<p>Substack has taken a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/substack-series-a/">bunch of venture capital money</a>, and they’re deploying it in a clever way to attract high-profile journalists. Here’s Newton’s explanation for his choice:</p>
<blockquote>I’d say that legal is about the biggest protection they’re offering, and it’s very significant. They’ve said they’ll spend up to a million dollars in your defense, and when you’re writing about potentially litigious companies, that matters a lot. Of everything Substack offered me, that’s most important.</blockquote>
<p>That takes one of the biggest concerns off the independent journalist’s shoulders. It’s <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/legal-support-for-substack-writers">a compelling advantage</a> that Substack has been able to buy — for now.</p>
<p>But this makes me nervous. I’d hate to see a “winner takes all” outcome in newsletter platforms, as we’ve seen in search, video, or social networking. Ironically, Newton has built his fame on writing about the problems and conflicts inherent in the platform monopolies, and yet, here he is helping build a new one…</p>
<p>How long until we’re writing about the stronghold that Substack has on the newsletter market? How long before it ends up building discovery models that favour the big stars, and make it harder for new voices to grow?</p>

<h2 id="3-how-long-before-publications-start-protecting-themselves-against-this">3. How long before publications start protecting themselves against this?</h2>
<p>I’ve long noted that simply getting a job on a high-profile title will change a journalist’s social media profile. Getting a job on a national/international paper is often a shortcut to thousands of new followers.</p>
<p>Now, that boost becomes a potential catapult to your own micro publication, which is what we’ve seen happen with Newton, among others. Eventually, publications are going to start taking some measures to stop themselves being used as mere stop-offs to self-publishing fame and fortune. It’s impossible to stop it, of course, but it is possible to minimise the damage done to the publication that acts as the incubator for the micro star.</p>
<p>For example, <em>The Verge</em> are letting Newton take his email subscriber list with him:</p>
<blockquote>I’ll be able to take my mailing list with me when I leave. I’ll remain a contributing editor at The Verge, and you can expect more columns and features from me there in the months to come.</blockquote>
<p>Not every publication will be as happy to do that. And I fully expect that to become less common in future. But clearly <em>The Verge</em> and Newton have come to an accommodation that works for both. (It might also go a long way to helping Newton resolve the discovery problem, to keep building his subscriber base.)</p>
<p>That said, it might be hard for major publications to retain those subscribers even if they do keep the email list for themselves. To go back to the blogging comparisons, it was interesting watching publishers fail to maintain high-profile blogs after the founder — who was strongly identified with that blog — left. (At least <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/author/jonostrower/">one reader here</a> might well remember that…)</p>

<p>Independence offers editorial freedom, a direct relationship with your readers, and the potential to drive your income up, if you can maintain and grow your subscriber base. To keep big name journalists, publications are going to have to make them financial offers that outweighs that.</p>
<p>Pay negotiations could get a lot more interesting…</p>
