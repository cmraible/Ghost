Now, I’ve always thought cars were made to be driven seeing as they have round wheels, engines, and other pieces of equipment designed to make them mobile, even though certain people think parking a classic in their living room and using the hood as a coffee table is acceptable.",

If you live somewhere that’s particularly cold, you know how ridiculous that statement is for the entire winter.

Factor in that weather conditions have to be ideal and you live in the UK, and that kind of a demand sounds like an impossible proposition or pretty close to it, especially if you have other stuff to do with your time.
