<p>For the second-gen Bel Air, GM gave the car a grille inspired by Ferrari, chrome headliner bands for hardtops, stainless steel window openings, and chrome fender spears as well as other design cues carried over from the first generation. Clad in a brilliant candy orange with a contrasting white two-tone on the roof, this Bel Air wagon restomod could not be in better shape. Plenty of beautiful chrome accents make the orange paint stand out even more including a chrome front grile, front and rear bumpers, hood ornament, and side mirrors complete with LED turn signals. This two-door wagon features a rear tailgate and liftgate split. The headlights and taillights are in excellent condition as well as the glass with high-quality pre-cut tint. A set of chrome 18-inch American Racing Torque Thrust II wheels sit on all four corners. According to the listing, the car only has 6,049 miles on this setup.</p>
<p>The heart of this restomod beats through a LS1 5.7-liter V8 engine mated to a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. The car is equipped with a Billet Tru Trac accessory drive, polished alternator, chrome air conditioning compressor, and an aluminum radiator. A dual exhaust adds to the rumble of the modern engine as well as providing a bit more oomph. Custom LS3 engine covers add more pizazz under the hood. Maneuvering is made easy thanks to power rack and pinion steering, and bringing everything to a halt are power disc brakes up front and drums out back. Custom springs give this wagon that perfect stance.</p>
