<p>This is rather cool. Mary Kirby who writes <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/runway-girl/">Runway Girl</a>, one of Flight Global’s blogs, has decided to turn her hand to vlogging, with a news round-up on video.</p>

<p>It’s a nice first effort. If I were to add constructive criticism, I’d recommend a few more pictures as well as the talking head shots, but nearly 500 views already is not bad going.</p>
<p>Feel free to give <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/runway-girl/2009/01/video-lets-get-it-started.html">Mary some feedback</a>.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
