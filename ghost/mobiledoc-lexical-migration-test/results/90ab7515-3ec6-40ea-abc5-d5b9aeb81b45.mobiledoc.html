<hr>
<p>We‚Äôve been familiar with Apocalypse Jeep builds for some time as well as other 6x6 conversions for trucks and off-road rigs. However, the public at large was just introduced to the concept in a big way when NBA Star Luka Doncic arrived for a game recently behind the wheel of an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/apocalypse-hellfire-6x6-jeep/">Apocalypse Hellfire 6x6 Jeep</a>. People went wild over the thing with some internet commenters calling it ‚Äúa literal tank‚Äù and others speculating whether such a thing is road legal or not.</p>

<p>The next shocking revelation came when the media announced the Jeep probably set the basketball player back a healthy $200,000. While we agree that‚Äôs a substantial amount of money, we also know these sorts of aftermarket builds don‚Äôt come cheap.</p>

<p>For that kind of cash Doncic and others aren‚Äôt just getting a third axle. Apocalypse, which is based in Florida, loads the big, heavy Jeep with plenty of power via a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 like what you find in a Hellcat, only tuned for even better peformance. Claimed 0-60 acceleration is 3.7 seconds, so even though it might looking like a lumbering tank to many, it can scoot in a hurry.</p>

<p>While the Jeep Gladiator does get a nice extension to accommodate the extra axle, it also benefits from a doubled towing capacity over factory spec. That‚Äôs right, owners can pull up to 12,000 lbs. which is useful, although we don‚Äôt see too many pulling a trailer.</p>

<p>One other huge advantage with a 6x6 vehicle is additional traction in difficult terrain. While Doncic and many others use these rigs in urban environments, they‚Äôre good for at least some off-roading situations, although we question how well they‚Äôd handle certain technical trails. Still, the aggressive looks and the sheer size of these things always cause a ruckus no matter who‚Äôs driving them.</p>
