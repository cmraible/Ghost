But while California’s cage ban might save some animals from the worst of abuses, it will take much more than cage bans to challenge industrialized animal agriculture.”"

That Covid would cause such a shock was obvious; as I noted above, before the pandemic hit in force, I predicted it. And now, the pandemic is introducing shortages into our politics for the first time in living memory, largely because our highly thinned out supply chains are no longer resilient. Forty years of consolidation suddenly met with a pandemic that required a social flexibility that our monopolistic commercial systems can no longer provide.”"

As part of its services to the industry, FTI monitored environmental activists online, and in one instance an employee created a fake Facebook persona — an imaginary, middle-aged Texas woman with a dog — to help keep tabs on protesters.”"

          " fails on almost every level. Kunhardt was either too uninterested or too worried about disrespecting the former president to include embarrassing but humanizing details that might have helped Obama’s early story rise above the level of a superficial campaign bio. Too focused on how inspiring it was that Obama made it to the country’s highest office, Kunhardt fails to mention that once he got there, he presided over rising economic inequality and deepened some of the Bush administration’s worst policies. Kunhardt’s interest even in the ‘politics of race’ is too focused on symbolism for the documentary to say anything real or interesting about racial injustice.”"

When burned, methane converts to carbon dioxide, and burning gas in buildings for heating, cooling and cooking is responsible for about a tenth of the United States’ carbon emissions.”"

He feels he came close in 1995 on ‘Weekend Update’: ‘Julia Roberts told reporters this week that her marriage to Lyle Lovett has been over for some time,’ he said, as a picture of the country singer’s asymmetrical face appeared behind him. ‘The key moment, she said, came when she realized that she was Julia Roberts, and that she was married to Lyle Lovett.’”"

It was the apocalyptic instant when a rock from outer space slammed into Earth, terminating the age of dinosaurs and eventually offering a bountiful new world to our mammalian ancestors. For 40 years, scientists have studied the tale of this catastrophic object, known now as the Chicxulub impactor. Today, the impactor represents more than just one bad day on Earth; instead, it has become a kind of Rosetta Stone that can decipher deeper riddles about the origins of life and the future of human civilization, both on our planet and in other worlds across the galaxy.”"
