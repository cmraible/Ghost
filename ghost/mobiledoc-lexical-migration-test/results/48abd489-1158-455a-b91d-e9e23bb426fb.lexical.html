<p>Many of us grew up watching the famous scene of Master Trooper Gay in Smokey and the Bandit, which inspired some to become Troopers. He taught through his love and laughter of life to be genuine and compassionate to those we serve. This icon will be missed and we ask that you keep his family in your thoughts as they mourn his passing.”</p>
