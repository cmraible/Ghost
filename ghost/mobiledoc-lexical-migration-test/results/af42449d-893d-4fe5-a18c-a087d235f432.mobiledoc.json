This is where the puzzle element comes into play as using the larger snowballs to create a safe path for the smaller ones prevents them from gaining mass. It becomes interesting as you’re always required to have a larger base for the body, medium size ball for the chest and little ball for the head. The challenge is getting these snowballs to the right position. While the first few puzzles start off fairly easy, new obstacles (like bird baths and benches) start to appear within the garden, adding extra obstacles to manoeuvre around. It’s a tricky mechanic that works fantastically once you get the hang of it. If this sounds complicated to you, try not to worry as you can press the B button to undo a move or the X button for a quick reset and this is very much appreciated."
