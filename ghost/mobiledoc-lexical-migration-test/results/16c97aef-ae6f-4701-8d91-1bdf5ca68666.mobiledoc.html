<p>So… which <a href="http://fashionista.com/2010/07/google-wants-to-be-more-fashionable/">bloggers “get” social media best</a>, according to Google?</p>
<div></div>><div>Google thinks fashion bloggers understand social media better than those covering other industries. So one of the world’s most powerful companies is tapping the brains of some of the world’s most powerful bloggers in order to get a better sense of how they consume and use media. Google is calling the program GStyle.</div>

<div>Interesting, because the reflexive assumption would be that it’s the tech industry. But then, personal experience has show that there are vast swathes of the tech industry that don’t “get” social media at all.</div><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
