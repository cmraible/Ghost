We'll take a look at the relative strengths and weaknesses of the three cars we've picked, then decide which one we'd like to add to our garage, which one we'd like to have for an afternoon, and which one we'd send to the scrapyard. If you're inclined, you're more than welcome to play along – you might come to a different conclusion than us."
