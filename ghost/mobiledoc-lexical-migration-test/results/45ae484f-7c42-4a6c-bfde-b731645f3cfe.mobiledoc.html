<p>Since this is a convertible model, cruising around in this Buick during the summertime is sublime. The red and white interior with shiny chrome trim looks absolutely fantastic and is a big part of the reason why this drop-top will break necks. Adding to the period-correct flair are chrome wire wheels with spinner caps.</p>

<p>Because this is a convertible, the red interior is just as much on display as the body. It looks just as blemish-free as the exterior and is loaded with factory details like the gauges, steering wheel, and push-button radio.</p>

The 364ci V8 pairs with an automatic transmission for strong, smooth acceleration that’s perfect for a leisurely cruise through town or a jaunt on the open road. There’s also a dual exhaust for that extra rumble to add to the fun.</p>
