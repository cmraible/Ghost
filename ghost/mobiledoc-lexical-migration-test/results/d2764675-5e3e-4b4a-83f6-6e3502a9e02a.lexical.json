Apparently this was a “sentimental purchase” since the proud new owner was carted around as a child in a Corolla exactly like this one. However, the brutal Iowa winters disintegrated the body after about 15 years and that childhood memory was left in the scrap yard. So this person decided to spend $17,000 to bring all those memories back. That’s great, but I sure wouldn’t spend that kind of money to bring back either car I was hauled around in as a kid, and they both were cooler than this one.
