<p><br>Beating Chevrolet to the Corvette, the Kaiser-Darrin Roadster was <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0221/open-roads--february/lots/r0040-1954-kaiser-darrin-roadster/1041431?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0221">debuted in 1952 </a>with a Willys 161 cubic-inch Hurricane F-head six-cylinder engine. The iconic sweeping and plunging lines with rosebud grille made it instantly recognizable. Pocket doors slide forward into the front fenders, a truly fascinating concept.</p>
