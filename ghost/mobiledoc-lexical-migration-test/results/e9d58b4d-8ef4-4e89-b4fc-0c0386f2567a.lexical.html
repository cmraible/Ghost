<p>The supply-chain crisis likely isn’t going away anytime soon. Even as the Omicron surge subsides, the decades of underinvestment and privatization that have caused shortages and contributed to inflation are here to stay — and matters could get worse as global warming-fueled natural disasters wreak havoc around the world. As we note in this edition of Weekend Reader, <em>The American Prospect</em> just released a special issue devoted to the crisis, and how we can work together to solve it.</p>

    <li><a href="https://prospect.org/economy/re-engineering-our-supply-chains/"><strong>Re-Engineering Our Supply Chains</strong></a> (The American Prospect) <em>— The American Prospect just released <a href="https://prospect.org/topics/feb-2022-issue/"><em>a special issue</em></a> on how outsourcing, monopolization, deregulation, and lack of public investment have short-circuited global supply chains, in the process raising costs and triggering shortages. Among other pieces in the collection, David Dayen argues for a common-sense solution to the turmoil: “You solve that only by rebuilding redundancy and resiliency. That means taking down the policy tyrannies that have forced reliance on faraway manufacturing plants, self-interested ocean shipping oligopolies, overwhelmed ports, deregulated trucking and rail systems, and retail giants and middlemen that see these cumulative problems as an opportunity to raise prices well above increased input costs. It means viewing the system as an engineer would, redesigning it for sustainability and strength rather than profit.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="http://nytimes.com/2022/02/09/business/truck-driver-shortage.html"><strong>The Real Reason America Doesn’t Have Enough Truck Drivers</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New York Times) <em>— Friend of the Poster Peter Goodman rode in a tractor trailer from Kansas City to Ft. Worth, Texas and back to explore the dark side of America’s truck driver crisis: “Here is a life spent navigating the hazards of piloting a truck weighing 26,000 pounds and pulling a 53-foot trailer, while balancing the need to ingest caffeine against the imperative to limit bathroom breaks. The hours pass, the towns recede, while the gnawing loneliness of the road is constant.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/11/afghanistan-frozen-assets-economy/"><strong>Biden’s Decision On Frozen Afghanistan Money Is Tantamount To Mass Murder</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>“​​After making the initially brave decision last summer to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, the Biden administration announced on Friday that it intends to split the Afghan central bank’s assets — which are held in the possession of the New York Federal Reserve Bank — between humanitarian groups and the families of 9/11 victims. The decision puts Biden on track to cause more death and destruction in Afghanistan than was caused by the 20 years of war that he ended.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social"><strong>When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlor</strong></a>d (ProPublica) <em>— “During the past decade, private equity-backed firms such as Greystar have stormed into the multifamily apartment market, snapping up rentals by the thousands and becoming major landlords in American cities, according to ProPublica’s analysis of National Multifamily Housing Council data on the nation’s biggest owners of apartment buildings with five or more units. Private equity is now the dominant form of financial backing among the 35 largest owners of multifamily buildings, the analysis showed. In 2011, about a third of the apartment units held by the top owners were backed by private equity. A decade later, half of them were… Private equity firms often act like a corporate version of a house flipper: They seek deals on apartment buildings, slash costs or hike rents to boost income, then unload the buildings at a higher price.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sicknote.co/p/guest-post-my-million-dollar-body"><strong>My Million-Dollar Body</strong></a><strong></strong>(Sick Note) <em>— “The Newark Beth Israel Medical Center reports a heart transplant surgery can ‘potentially cost well over 1 million dollars.’ By that logic, my body is worth millions, and it still doesn’t work right. And I have to pay hundreds of dollars — a steal — to keep it functioning each month. I turned 26 nearly two years ago, and have navigated the impossibly complicated world of health insurance on my own since then. It is no understatement to say it has influenced every life decision I have made since.”</em></li>

Well into her 50s, she’s eclipsed the normal lifespan of an orca in the wild — and long since surpassed the life expectancy of one captured. As they await her fate, a band of whale fanatics in Washington — scientists, capture converts, and spiritual relatives — have advanced an ambitious plan to bring her back to the Salish Sea. They could have come together much sooner.”</em></li>

The other thing you realize is that you have a history. Your history didn’t start on the shores of the United States. It didn’t start with slavery. Your history started [in] Africa at the beginning of time, the beginning of civilization.’”</em></li>
