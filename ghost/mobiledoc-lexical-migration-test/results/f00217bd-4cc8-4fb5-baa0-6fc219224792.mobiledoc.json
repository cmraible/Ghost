This incident further reinforces the image of modern Mopar muscle cars being the vehicle of choice for criminals across North America, particularly Hellcats. After all, they’re capable of outrunning the cops and apparently running them down."

That deputy attempted to pull over the muscle car, but the drive, 24-year-old Kody McElveen, decided to make a run for it instead of complying."

However, McElveen saw it coming, swerving to miss the tire-puncturing spikes. In the process the hit the deputy with the corner of the front bumper. We have no idea if he was trying to hit the deputy, but he didn’t skip a beat after he did."

He apparently was inside, we assume grabbing some ingredients for dinner. As he left the store he noticed deputies waiting to arrest him so he made a run for it on foot. The guy should’ve worked on his cardio more because he was taken down in the parking lot."
