<p><a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This 1993 model</a> is one of the last cars produced, being built in January 1993 as #237 out of 281 cars total. It's finished in <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Monza Red</a>, a beautiful color that looks terrific on the XJ220's curvaceous, low-slung body.</p>
<p>The car is currently located in Chicago, Illinois, making <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">one of very few</a> XJ220s in the United States. Despite its fame, it was never officially imported to the US when it was new, but a few crafty, well-heeled owners found a way to get their hands on one.</p>

<p>The auction listing states that <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this XJ220</a> is in nearly perfect condition inside and out. Given that the odometer reads just 2,921 kilometers – that's just over 1,800 miles – that should come as no surprise to anyone.</p>
<p>Despite the low miles, this Jaguar XJ220 has always been maintained in driving condition. It's ready to <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">go just about anywhere</a> you'd like at a moment's notice as quickly as you can get there.</p>

<p>We doubt that <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the next owner</a> will exercise this car very much, though. Given the car's value and low mileage, it will very likely remain a treasured collectible, accumulating miles only on very special occasions.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1993-jaguar-xj220-30?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The auction for this car</a> begins October 1, so you should prepare to bid ahead of time. You don't want to miss your chance to own one of the most legendary supercars of all time.</p>
