<p>1970 was an iconic year for the infamous <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-police-chase/">Dodge Charger</a>, the newly designed grille combined with the new dash, steering colon, and interior to make the 1970 production year a fantastic one. However, the redesign of the charger in 1970 is nothing in comparison to this beautiful restomod. Restoring an old muscle car is one thing, but modifying it afterward is an entirely different beast. </p>

<p>Aside from all of the criticism from muscle car purists, many challenges are associated with restomodding a monster like this. Although that may be true, the team over at MirandaBuilt was able to manage to take the already brilliant styling of the original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/strope-1968-dodge-charger/">2nd gen Charger</a> and make it even better.</p>

<p>The Detroit Autorama first-place winner sports a roaring side exit exhaust system that delivers sound from its 9.4-liter Hemi V8. That same monstrous V8 is pushing out 667-horsepower and 735 lb/ft of torque which is translated through the Rossler 4L80E 4-speed automatic transmission. </p>
