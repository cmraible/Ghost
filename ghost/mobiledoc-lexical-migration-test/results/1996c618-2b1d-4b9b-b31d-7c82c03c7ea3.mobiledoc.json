To throw people off even more, the owner has used Holden badges, something most Americans wouldn’t recognize. It’s possible people think it’s some weird European car, but almost nobody would suspect it’s nearly as powerful as it is. Maybe the LSA badging gives a little bit away."

The LS3 V8 pushes 415-hp without that forced induction, so it’s a big boost. He could’ve gone even more aggressive, but this car is a daily driver and it needs to also be comfortable. Considering it’s a full-size sedan with comfy leather seats and plenty of rear legroom, that’s part of the point of owning an SS Sedan."
