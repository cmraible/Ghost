<p>Videobob Moseley is selling a classic car used in the spinoff series of Knight Rider, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/david-hasselhoffs-knight-rider-car/amp/">Knight Rider</a> 2000. K.I.F.T. stands for Knight Industries Four Thousand, which assisted Micheal Knight in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-knight-rider-movie/">Knight Rider</a> 2000 as well as being featured in many other films as background, extra, and even hero cars. Some of the movies this car has seen include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Knight Rider 2000</li>
    <li>CHiPs 99</li>
    <li>Black Scorpion</li>
    <li>Power Rangers Time-Force</li>
    <li>Scare Tactics</li>
</ul>
<p>This one of only 4 screen-used K.I.F.T. cars built, the four that were built include a stunt car, an interior shot car, a boat, and the famous Hero car. This is the most Value, this is the beloved Hero that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/david-hasselhoffs-knight-rider-car/">David Hasselhoff</a> drove. It is also the only existing example of this car available for sale. However, if you were expecting to see a mint condition model that has been preserved beautifully due to the nature of this car being the only one of its kind available you would be wrong. The motor blew up during shooting on the set of Scare Tactics and was retired to the garage of this poor soul who dared to dream of one day restoring it.</p>
<p>Pontiac had the show change the car because it too closely resembled their Banshee concept car. Minor changes were made, however, the car still resembles the Banshee in many ways, and because of this, the two get mixed in movies frequently. The actual car was built on top of the 1990 Dodge Stealth, a massive downgrade from the original 3rd gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/first-gen-pontiac-firebird/">Firebird</a>. So in essence what we have is a 30-year-old car that doesn't run, does not have a title, does not have turn signals or mirrors, and is FWD. I suppose that would explain the minuscule $20,000 price tag in comparison to some of the other “screen-used” Hero cars. However, if you're looking for something cheap, unique, and looks like a freaking spaceship then this may be <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/254835661579">the car for you</a>.</p>
