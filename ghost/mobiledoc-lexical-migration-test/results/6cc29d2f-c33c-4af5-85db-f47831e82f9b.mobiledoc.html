<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11102">The ZR-1</a> made a name for itself as a no-nonsense competition-ready option in 1970 but was discontinued in 1972. General Motors revived the nameplate in 1990 with the help of Lotus and Mercury Marine in hopes of creating the fastest Corvette ever made. Lotus designed the 375-horsepower DOHC LT5 engine for <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11102">exclusive use in the ZL-1</a>, Mercury Marine assembled them, and GM paired them with a unique ML9 6-speed manual transmission. Fitting the new drivetrain in the C4 Corvette resulted in a documented 0-60 acceleration time of 4.4 seconds, a quarter mile time of 13.4 seconds, and a top speed of over 180-mph. Despite setting a 24-Hours Endurance world record speed of over 175-mph, <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11102">only 6,939 C4 ZR-1 models were made</a>.</p>
