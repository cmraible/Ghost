Rolls-Royce will use part-polished wheels with a unique translucent shadow finish plus a silver pinstripe, which no doubt will be mesmerizing whether the car is sitting or rolling down the road. There’s also a vapor-blasted titanium finish for the Aero Cowling windbreak show in great detail. The Silver Bullet name will be in a contrast machined text, so it stands out in a big way."

For example, there is carbon fiber but it’s an open-pore variety, so you get a dash of new material with some texture to it. Quilted leather with contrast stitching is also confirmed, while real wood could possibly be available, although the open-pore carbon fiber might displace it."
