          "Luxury automobile owners have been hit pretty hard by the increasing audacity of these criminals as more people's cars are broken into and rummaged through. It may not seem an insanely profitable crime, but these burglars have apparently made away with several valuable goods. Some of these include a laptop, purses, sunglasses, and guns, making for a vast laundry list of goods taken from their owners. The latter items are terrifying as this means that the victims are being stripped of their ability to defend themselves by the very people they would need defending from."

          "\"Who are these thieves?\" you may ask. Unfortunately, it would appear that the good ole' mask and gloves trick is working out for them. The police have been unsuccessful in identifying the assailants though they note that they seem to operate in groups of three at times and have been seen driving off in a Lexus. It's also likely that their escape vehicle has been stolen, but authorities haven't shared much more information about the team of land pirates. Something needs to be done to prevent crimes like this from happening as these robberies become more and more common."
