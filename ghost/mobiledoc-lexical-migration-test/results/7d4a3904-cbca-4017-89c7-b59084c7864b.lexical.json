([Full break-down of the numbers.](http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/some-meaningful-numbers-on-the-times-paywall/)) Partially I’m surprised, because nobody seems to be comparing acquisition cost to revenue, as well as the technology development needed to sustain this effort, and are treating the revenue as all money to be spent on journalism. Or, indeed, how much advertising revenue they’ve lost. But mainly because, well, I think those numbers could well go down, not up.\n\nHere’s the thing – I’m *two *of those 105,000. I’ve paid for the [iPad app](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2010/06/the_times_they_are_aipadding.html) monthly sub a couple of times, and I currently have a paywall subscription. The problem for *The Times*, and the assumption that subs will grow from that base is this: I’m going to go from two of those subscribers to 1, or probably zero.\n\nWhile I used the Times iPad app quite a lot in the early months, I’ve stopped using it entirely in the last couple of months. The [free Telegraph app](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-telegraph-for-ipad/id388947468?mt=8) is part of that, but really, I’m using my RSS reader on the iPad in preference to the Times format. The lack of search, the lack of ability to share and comment on what I’m reading actually makes it less valuable to me than many free-to-air sites are. *They are, in effect, asking me to pay for a reduction in value as compared to competitive products*. That’s not a good proposition. And yes, the same holds true for the the paywalled version, too. I’m hanging on in there for two reasons: a couple of bloggers I value, and the fact that unsubscribing is difficult – you have to phone up and do it, you can’t cancel it on the web.\n\nAnd the cynic in me can’t help feeling that there’s a reason for that…\n\nThat aside, the really significant figures aren’t these – they are the ones from a year’s time. Then we’ll know how this is really going. \n\n<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 1.25em; \">Related articles</font></legend> \n- [<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \">The successes and failures of the Times’s paywall</font>](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/11/print-sales-times-paywall)<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \"> (newstatesman.com)</font>\n- [<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \">Times’s paywall figures don’t add up to a new business model</font>](http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2010/nov/02/paywalls-newsinternational&a=27590559&rid=d637ce15-7a7b-4fcc-a6f0-0e2e03682643&e=2e74a5e2a2e1df7ac9aa77eee44c1863)<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \"> (guardian.co.uk)</font>\n- [<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \">Victory for paywalls? 105,000 shell out for Murdoch’s Times [TNW UK]</font>](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2010/11/02/victory-for-paywalls-105000-shell-out-for-murdochs-times/)<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \"> (thenextweb.com)</font>\n- [<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \">Times Paywall In Questionable ‘success’</font>](http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/11/02/1245201/Times-Paywall-In-Questionable-success)<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \"> (news.slashdot.org)</font>\n- [<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \">Some meaningful numbers on the Times paywall</font>](http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/some-meaningful-numbers-on-the-times-paywall/)<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \"> (malcolmcoles.co.uk)</font>\n- [<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \">Times Online claims 200K paid users: but where’s the detailed breakdown?</font>](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/11/02/times-online-claims.html)<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; \"> (boingboing.net)</font>\n\n"
