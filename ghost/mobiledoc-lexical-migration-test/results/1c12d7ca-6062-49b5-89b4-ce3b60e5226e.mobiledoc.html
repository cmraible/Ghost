<p>Every year, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-camaro-recovered-in-kansas-field/">insurance companies</a> issue reports regarding the models that are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wildest-stolen-car-stories/">most frequently stolen</a>. These vehicles tend to have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-graveyard/">a few things in common</a>.</p>
<p>For one, they have parts that are valuable on the secondary market. Another contributing factor tis how difficult a given car is to break into. That shouldn't surprise anyone.</p>

<p>Car theft is a crime of opportunity, and if it takes too long to break into a car, thieves will move on and pick something easier. The more time they spend trying to steal a particular car, the higher their risk of being caught. They want to get in and out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://driving.ca/honda/auto-news/news/ontarios-top-50-stolen-cars-this-year-picked-off-partly-for-street-racing-purposes">Driving.ca</a> discovered, car thefts seem to exhibit regional trends. Pickup trucks tend to go missing a lot more in Alberta, while Ontario sees many luxury SUVs getting swiped.</p>

<p>Of particular interest is a string of Honda Civic thefts in Ontario. Out of 446 stolen throughout Canada, a whopping 330 went missing from Ontario alone. Driving.ca seems to think that street racers are stealing them.</p>
<p>Are street racers still using Honda Civics? The Civic Si and Type R are admittedly pretty hot cars. We wonder how many of them make up that total of 330 stolen Civics.</p>

<p>We do know that Honda Civic parts are worth quite a bit of money on the secondhand market, and they're popular cars, so those parts are also constantly in demand.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure â€“ if you have a Honda Civic and you live in Ontario, make sure that you keep it locked up in the garage. If that's not an option, you might want to consider upping your insurance coverage.</p>
