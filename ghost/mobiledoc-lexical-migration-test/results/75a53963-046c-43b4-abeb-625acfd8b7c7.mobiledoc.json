Ringbrothers poured an astounding 3,000 work hours into this machine over a 7-month period, so it’s been gone over in detail. You can always tell when a build has had such keen attention paid to the small things. But all that comes at a cost, and in this case it’s to the tune of $85,000 for just the parts, not labor. That’s steep, well beyond the means of most people, but this sure is a nice truck to admire."
