          ". Brosnan played Agent 007 in four movies. After the final one, Aston Martin gave him a factory-customized V12 Vanquish, right at the start of the first generation of the beloved GT. However, back in 2015 the Brosnan residence was engulfed in fire and the car was lost. According to the movie star, the only thing of it that remained were the two plates indicating it was a bespoke model built for him."

And while they’re notoriously expensive to fix, there’s little doubt Brosnan can foot the bill for keeping his Range Rover Vogue HSE running just fine. It also was the flagship of the Land Rover lineup when it hit the market back in 2013, pushing the luxury offerings of the brand to a new level. In other words, this SUV is a huge rolling testament to British patriotism."

Brosnan has a 2018 BMM 750i, which isn’t really much of a driver’s car, but it does come with all kinds of comforts as well as gadgetry, and that must be why he likes it so much."

If you’ve seen one in person you know they’re mesmerizing to look at, so it’s easy to see why some people have to own them. Plus, when living in Malibu you get extra social points for driving something which doesn’t have to burn gasoline, so that surely was a deciding factor in the purchase."

          "Not everything Pierce Brosnan owns is modern. He has a 1965 Ford Anglia in his collection, after all, a car that was wildly popular in Britain during its nine-year production run. Consumers in the UK fell in love with the Detroit styling of the Anglia, which features tail fins and quit a bit of chrome. It was also the first car Brosnan drove, which he purchased from his step-father for a mere £50 back in 1971. Of course, the Ford was far from perfect, like how he had to hold up the driver’s door while climbing inside. We all have to start somewhere and this humble little car was how Brosnan began his love affair of things with four wheels."
