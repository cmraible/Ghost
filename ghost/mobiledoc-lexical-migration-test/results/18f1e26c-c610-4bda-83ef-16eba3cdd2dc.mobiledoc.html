<p>When the Jaguar XJS was released, its styling was a "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wildest-rust-wrapped-cars/">love it or hate it</a>" affair. The modern design, which incorporated a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2020-mercedes-benz-amg-gt-r-pro/">wind-cheating</a> "flying buttress" shape into its styling, was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/highway-driver-dukes-hazzard/">controversial to say the least</a>.</p>
<p>That's not entirely the car's fault. The XJS had big shoes to fill, as it effectively replaced the much-loved E-Type, widely considered to be one of the most beautiful cars in the world.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/211256/1985-jaguar-xjs">1985 Jaguar XJS</a> looks incredible to us, though. With just 19,000 miles on the odometer, it still looks new from its stunning Damson Red paint to its plush leather interior.</p>
<p>Apparently, the car's second owner purchased it with just 1,400 miles. In the ensuing years, he drove it sparingly, racking up just 17,000 or so miles. Recently, it's changed hands a few times, but it's only covered around 1,000 miles in the past seven years.</p>

<p>That's not to say that this classic Jaguar isn't ready for action. It's been fastidiously maintained, which any Jaguar V12 owner will tell you is key to avoiding costly headaches.</p>
<p>Under the long hood, you'll find a 5.3 liter fuel injected V12, good for nearly 300 horsepower. Our favorite feature, though, is the wheels.</p>

<p>At each corner, you'll find a five-spoke aluminum wheel from a 1995-1996 Jaguar XJ-R. In our opinion, this early XJS shape looks great with these wheels.</p>
