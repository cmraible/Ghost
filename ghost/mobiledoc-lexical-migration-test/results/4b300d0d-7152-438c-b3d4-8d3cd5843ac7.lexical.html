<p>Stolen Dodge muscle cars and Kias have been grabbing plenty of headlines over the past few years, however a theft trend in Houston is targeting full-size GMC, Chevy, and Ford trucks. That’s according to theft reports gathered by Houston police. From January 2022 to June 2022 a whopping 1,253 Silverados were reported stolen, 540 Sierras, and 315 F-150s.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you this from the heart, if you've got a GMC or Chevy truck, you've got to do more. You can't just cross your fingers. We are past that," said Houston Police Department's Auto Theft Sgt. Tracy Hicks to a local news station.</p>
<p>According to Hicks, theft rings have devised a method to steal 2017-2021 GMC Sierras and Chevy Silverados without breaking any glass. The thieves are so well-trained they can boost a truck in just minutes. And because they’re so similar, these criminals will also go after GMC Yukons, Chevy Tahoes, Suburbans, and Cadillac Escalades from the same model year range.</p>

<p>Of course, GM vehicle owners likely have OnStar activated, but thieves have learned how to disable that quickly so the vehicle can’t be located and the engine can’t be remotely shut off.</p>
<p>What Hicks believes is driving this trend is the ubiquitous nature of these trucks. "I can take the engines, especially out of any of those from a '17 to a '21, and put them in anything," Hicks said. "The fenders, the tailgates, the parts can be used on any vehicle."</p>
<p>In other words, while everyone had fun jeering Dodge and Kia owners, thieves might be fixing their sites on your pickup or SUV. It’s a good idea to install some aftermarket deterrents like an alarm, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/kill-switches-new-cars/">kill switch</a>, and GPS tracker. Hicks says mechanics should know exactly how to stop this problem dead in its tracks.</p>
