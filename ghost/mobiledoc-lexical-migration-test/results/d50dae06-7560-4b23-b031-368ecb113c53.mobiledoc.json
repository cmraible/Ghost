Unlike many tech-based conferences, which are very rooted in the now, they have a remarkable knack of looking about two years into the future, and giving you a sense of what the world might look like then. Iâ€™ve been working with them since January, and itâ€™s one of the pieces of work I enjoy the most. Hereâ€™s all the liveblogging I did for them earlier in the month:\n\n##Day One\n- [The Future of the Network and the History of the Computer ](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/the-future-of-the-network-and-the-history-of-the-computer/)â€“ two keynotes that kicked off the conference, withÂ [RenÃ© Obermann](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ren-obermann \"RenÃ© Obermann\") of Deutsche Telecom talking about a more open future for mobile networks, and George Dyson showing how the past of computing might point its way to the future.\n- [Towards the internet of things](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/towards-the-internet-of-things/) â€“ four talks about the emerging world of networked smart objects\n- [Designing Digital Services by Putting People First](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/designing-digital-services-by-putting-people-first/) â€“ a great talk for agencies and product managers byÂ Lousia Heinrich of Fjord, about human-centric success\n- [Making Books into a shareable experience](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/making-books-into-a-shareable-experience/) â€“Â [Henrik Berggren](http://www.hinkeb.com/ \"Henrik Berggren\") of Readmill has ideas of how to make eBooks more networked.\n- [Hacker kids, Maker culture and Wired clothing](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/hacker-kids-maker-culture-and-wired-clothing/) â€“ my personal favourite session of the first day. It felt like a glimpse into the culture of five years hence â€“ or what talking to the [Homebrew Computer Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club \"Homebrew Computer Club\") must have been like.Â \n- [TV to come , TV to go](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/tv-to-come-tv-to-go/) â€“ a panel looking at visions of Future TV.Â \n- [The startup pitch winners](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/startup-pitch-winners-squadmail/)\n\n##Day Two\n- [The velocity of digital business](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/the-velocity-of-digital-business/) â€“Â Ajaz Ahmed and James Hilton of [AKQA](http://akqa.com \"AKQA\") with a vision of doing great work in a digital age\n- [Give the teddy bears WiFi](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/give-the-teddy-bears-wifi/) â€“ Russell Daviesâ€™ grab-bag talk of ideas from the future\n- [Selling fashion online and printed clothes](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/selling-fashion-online-and-printing-clothes/) â€“ a weird mix of pragmatic advice about selling clothes online â€“ and whole new ways of creating clothes, including 3D printed bikinis!\n- [Three views of the future of media](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/three-views-of-the-future-of-media/) â€“ always connected consumers, updating eBooks and the psychology of publishing\n- [Dave Weinberger & the future of everything](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/david-weinberger-the-network-of-everything/) â€“ not aÂ childrenâ€™sÂ adventure novel, whatever the title makes it sound like. ðŸ˜‰ Mr Weinberger takes us on a gallop through the likely consequences of the networked world.Â \n- [James Bridle: Moving beyond the fanfics of technology and place](http://nextconf.eu/2012/05/james-bridle-moving-beyond-the-fanfics-of-technology-and-place/) â€“ a brain-stretching journey through the cultural consequences for places and ideas of mash-up culture\n\n[Videos of all the sessions](http://nextconf.eu/video/) are flowing onto the site now. Loads of juicy brain food for you there!\n"
