<h2 id="emerging-independent-media">Emerging Independent Media</h2>
<p>I've used a personal classification system to judge media for years now. Any media entity is usually in one of three states as we move through the digitalisation of everything:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Emergence</li>
    <li>Evolution</li>
    <li>Extinction</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm planning to write more about how the pandemic is accelerating all three of those, but let's start off with Emergence. </p>
<p>Emerging media is going through a quiet boom right now. Lots of laid-off journalists or under-employed freelancers are experimenting with their own newsletters or podcasts. Newsletter platform Substack has just announced its next fellowship for independent writers, for example:</p>

<p>It's vaguely reminiscent of the original blog boom in the early 2000s, which was born of the dotcom crash leaving loads of techies with times on their hands. They created both blogs and the tools to create them with, and were the foundation layer of what later became known as Web 2.0. </p>
<p>One of the interesting things about the pandemic destroying two of the three legs sustaining most media businesses - events and advertising - is the invountary freeing-up of talent to create their own thing in the pandemic recession. Most of these ventures will stumble quickly, and others will vanish as soon as the creator is re-employed. But some will stick, and we'll have a new wave of emerging media to get excited about.</p>
<p>Why am I writing about this today? </p>
<p>Because of this:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://podnews.net/article/podcasting-indies-size">

<p>We've seen a huge consolidation of talent in podcasts - but the big companies still only represent about 50% of the market. And, without doubt, some of the most interesting experimentation is happening in the 49% of indie podcasts. My own listening is well over 70% indies.</p>
<p>As long as podcasting stays an open format, with easy-to-use apps, we can expect it to be a reasonably easy place for people to start creating their own media products.</p>
<h2 id="twitchys-itchy-ban-hammer">Twitchy's itchy ban hammer </h2>
<p>We had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/06/sdl-toxic-communities-narcassism/">signs this was coming</a> last week - but the consequences of sexual harassment and assault in the streaming community are finally hitting home:</p>

<p>What's interesting is that Twitch (owned by Amazon) is <em>not</em> making exemptions for political figures and political speech. And one particular figure has been hit by the temporary ban hammer:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/technology/twitch-trump.html">
        <div class="kg-bookmark-content">
            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Twitch Suspends Trump’s Channel for ‘Hateful Conduct’</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">The action appeared to be the first outright suspension of one of the president’s social media accounts.</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.nytimes.com/vi-assets/static-assets/apple-touch-icon-319373aaf4524d94d38aa599c56b8655.png" alt><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Kellen Browning</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">NYTimes</span></div>

    </a></figure>
<p>When I first saw that headline, my hideous brain immediately made the connection between that suspension, and Twitch's normal approach of <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-suspends-streamer-after-she-wears-chun-li-cospla-1838142321">suspending users for "suggestive attire"</a>.</p>
<p>My brain had to suffer that mental picture, now yours does, too. </p>
<p>It's interesting to see the action against politicians breaking platforms' terms of service ratcheting up. Twitter has led the way, but Twitch is upping the ante.</p>
<h2 id="google-opens-its-wallet">Google opens its wallet</h2>
<p>Well, now. This is <em>just</em> what publishers in Europe have been demanding for some time. Or, at least it is on the surface. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.axios.com/google-will-start-paying-publishers-to-license-content-d05550e5-cc0f-4177-a7db-b085af9157bb.html">
        <div class="kg-bookmark-content">
            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Google will start paying publishers to license content</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">It’s a major departure from its long-standing practice of not paying publishers directly to distribute their work,</div>

<p>When you dig deeper, it's a bit more complicated:</p>
<blockquote>[…] the search giant is creating a licensing program to pay publishers "for high-quality content" as a part of <strong>a new news product</strong> launching later this year.</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. It looks like Google is launching something more akin to Apple News (yes, Google has had similar products before. No, that's never stopped it trying multiple versions. Look how many messaging apps there have been over the years…)</p>
<p>So, as Joshua Benton points out, this has more than the whiff of a PR move designed to head off regulation:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/">

<p>Benton:</p>
<blockquote>From the duopoly’s perspective, the biggest problem with paying for all the news coursing through their digital veins <em>isn’t</em> the money. (They have plenty of money.) It’s that paying for news in any systemic way would attack their core advantage as platforms: organizing <em>other</em> people’s content.</blockquote>
<p>For Google, in particular, it's really important that they stay as a major intermediary between us and the audience. For us, it's important to make sure we have as many direct relationships as possible. Google's money shouldn't seduce us away from that goal. </p>

<p>In light of the news that Reddit has closed a swathe of the more toxic subreddits, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules">including the infamous r/The_Donald Trump-supporting community</a>, this read from last month provides some interesting context on how community management does - or doesn't - work there. </p>

<p>Possibly because I've been <a href="https://microblog.onemanandhisblog.com/2020/06/30/it-is-just.html">scanning old negatives</a>, I've been enjoying some music from the late 80s and early 90s, including Mike Oldfield's magnificent <em>Tubular Bells II</em>.</p>

<p>And, as a bonus, here's a live performance of it. This is doubly nostalgic for me, as I went to a lot of live events at Edinburgh Castle as a child in the 80s. </p>
