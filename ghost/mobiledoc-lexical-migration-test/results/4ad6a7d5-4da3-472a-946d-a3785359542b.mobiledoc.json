Perceptions of the sports car have evolved over time, from many thinking they’re essentially a two-door Camry to being taken seriously as highly-tunable cars capable of pushing monstrous amounts of power. That growing reputation has lead to prices in the collector market increasing and supply being more constrained, although making the effort to get one can be well-rewarded."

Under the hood is the legendary 2JZ turbocharged inline-six engine, which works with a nice 6-speed manual transmission. It also sports an upgraded air intake, exhaust, a Do-Luck body kit, and Ray’s Gram Lights wheels. While it looks white, in person you can see a blue pearl, really making this car a masterpiece."

This is about as close as anyone is going to get to a new A80, so the price reflects the rarity and the market trends. What you get, though, is a highly-collectible example which is definitely enviable."

After all, the seller claims a mere 66,492 miles have been racked up in the past 32 years and that alone is pretty incredible. Also astounding is the excellent condition of that glossy Dark Red Metallic exterior and the fact the Gray interior shows no rips, splits, or other signs of damage. Even the factory wheels have zero curb rash. Someone definitely babied this car, making it reasonable to expect the factory 3.0-liter inline-six engine runs smooth."

Since this is a higher-mileage example than some of the others with 133,970 miles on the clock, the price is a little easier to swallow. As a big bonus, the twin-turbo 2JZ has some nice mods, like a Turbonetics 6465 billet dual ball bearing turbo, HKS intercooler, dual blow-off valves, Turbonetics Racegate wastegate, SMC alcohol injection kit, a custom adjustable cam, and a custom exhaust. All that helps push output to a claimed 660-horsepower. In other words, this Supra scoots in a hurry and can be addictive to drive."
