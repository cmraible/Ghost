<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As a <em>Daily Poster</em> supporting subscriber, you are helping us build a grassroots-funded outlet that does accountability journalism — and so I wanted to pass on <a href="https://bluetent.us/arenas/media-message/david-sirota-s-daily-poster-wants-to-end-the-scourge-of-brun/">this new profile</a> that details what we’re doing, and how much impact we’re making, <strong>thanks to your support.</strong></p>
<p>The new story comes from <em>Blue Tent</em>, which is affiliated with the publication <em>Inside Philanthropy</em>. It takes a look at everything we’ve been doing, and so I encourage you to read the whole thing and share it with your friends to encourage them to subscribe.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><strong>“I think my views about what a journalist should be doing are clear,” Sirota said. “It’s to be challenging the powerful, scrutinizing the powerful. And that’s the consistent thread through what I do, and so that doesn’t mean that I’m going to carry water for one or the other political party all or most of the time.”…<br><br>In their short run, Sirota, Perez and their small team have written stories attacking Democrats and Republicans alike. Daily Poster writer Walker Bragman has gone after Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, Biden’s choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, for<a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-picks-budget-director-who-pushed/"><strong> her past comments</strong></a> indicating support for cutting Social Security. Sirota and Perez <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-beltway-left-is-normalizing-corruption/"><strong>piled on,</strong></a> tarring Tanden for accepting corporate and foreign donations and accusing her of union busting for shuttering CAP’s independent publication ThinkProgress in 2019…<br><br>In early December, Perez and Daily Poster reporter Julie Rock<a href="__GHOST_URL__/possible-hhs-pick-shielded-nursing/"><strong> reported</strong></a> that Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, then a leading candidate for Biden’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, had signed an executive order shielding nursing homes and other healthcare companies from COVID-related lawsuits a day after industry lobbyists requested she do so. Within days, Raimondo removed herself from consideration for the post (it was later announced that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra would be Biden’s nominee to run HHS)…<br><br>As for Republicans, Daily Poster has published<a href="__GHOST_URL__/breaking-barrett-forced-to-respond/"><strong> scoops</strong></a> about now-Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s fossil fuel ties, drawing responses from Capitol Hill during her confirmation battle. They’ve also<a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-the-lincoln-project-set-liberals/"><strong> excoriated</strong></a> the Lincoln Project, the anti-Trump Republican super PAC, for failing to decrease Trump’s share of Republican votes in 2020 despite raising tens of millions from Democratic donors.</strong></blockquote>
