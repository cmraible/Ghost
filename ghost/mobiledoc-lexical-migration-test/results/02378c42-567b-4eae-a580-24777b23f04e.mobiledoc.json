I have to admit, I was yelling at the screen that the guy on the bike could go up and knock on the window while they were stuck in traffic. After the traffic cleared, and what appeared to be a pursuit vehicle sliding over just enough for the 'Vette to squeeze through, it was a no-go for the police vehicles trying to block him in. "
