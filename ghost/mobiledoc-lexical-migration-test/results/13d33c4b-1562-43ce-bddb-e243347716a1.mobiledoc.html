<p>Friends:</p>
<p>You’ve seen the success we’ve had in the last few weeks, culminating with <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1335982868732944386?s=20">big impact</a> in the Cabinet selection process. Now here’s a special limited-time offer for you that I <em>really</em> hope you will consider:</p>
<p><strong>Right now, if you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to subscribe to </strong><em><strong>The Daily Poster</strong></em><strong>, we will include a free gift subscription for you to give to anyone of your choosing.</strong></p>
<p>The idea here is to create a win-win: you might need a good holiday gift for friends and family, and we’re trying to hire more reporters to hold politicians accountable in 2021, which means we need as many free subscribers to become supporting subscribers. So when you subscribe, you get a free holiday gift to give to someone, and you’re helping us hire more journalists.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works: <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become an annual supporting subscriber, and then email <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">editor@dailyposter.com</a> with the email address you’d like to give your free gift subscription to. The recipient will get a free annual subscription to </strong><em><strong>The Daily Poster</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>Remember: when you subscribe, you are not just helping us do more accountability journalism — you also get access to all of our subscriber-only content like the Midday Poster and you get access to all of our live events, where subscribers get to ask guests questions in real time.</p>
<p>Please consider taking advantage of this offer. We are relying on our supporting subscribers to help us spread the word about what we are doing — and to help us build an even bigger subscriber base to support accountability journalism.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the team!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
