<p>As a growing number of cars from the '80s and '90s become classics and increasingly collectible, we're going to see more examples of low-mileage, one-owner cars hit the market. This beautiful <a href="https://inventory.driversource.com/vehicles/997/1987-mercedes-benz-560-sec?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">1987 Mercedes-Benz 560 SEC</a> is a perfect example of this trend, and <a href="http://www.driversource.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Driver Source</a> can get you behind the wheel.</p>

<p>This full-size luxury coupe is a time capsule with just 23,000 miles on the odometer, and it's obvious the level of care and maintenance that went into ensuring this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rare-mercedes-benz-500-k/">Mercedes</a> remained like new. What makes the condition of this car even more impressive is the fact that it spent the first 32 years of its life in New York, but it is currently being sold out of Houston, Texas. Backing up its history, this car boasts flawless reports from both Carfax and Autocheck.</p>
<p>Visually, the 1987 Mercedes-Benz 560 SEC was a stunning example of a luxury back in the late 1980s, and it still has an imposing presence today. These pictures don't do the color justice, but this 560 is painted in Blue Black metallic lacquer finish, and the interior is absolutely immaculate with the gray leather and wood trim. As expected from a car that has been this babied, there doesn't appear to be any wear in this cabin, and the car looks stunning inside and out thanks to a recent detail.</p>
<p>Backing up the luxury, the 560 SEC was powered by a 5.5-liter V8 that helped rocket this big four-seater from 0-60 in around seven seconds (quite impressive for that era) and to a top speed of 149 mph. Bottom line, this car is as ready for a quiet night to the theater as it is blasting down the autobahn.</p>
