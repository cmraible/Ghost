The way you say no can be changed to several different languages, with a male and female option for each language. The sound team really makes the game flow well while going that extra mile to grab other languages for players to use. With the developers being from Germany, you notice a bit of a struggle saying some of the more difficult English words, such as photosynthesis, however it adds to the comedic charm of the game.
