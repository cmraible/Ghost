That's especially true when the C2 in question has side pipes – everyone loves side pipes.</h3>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10848&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This 1966 Corvette</a> is a 327/350 horsepower model, featuring the side pipes that originally came on the big block cars. Aside from this deviation, the car is stock and numbers-matching according to the ad.</p>

<p>The ad also references that this is an older frame-off restoration, and the car presents very well from the photos. The radio, power antenna, and all gauges are listed as working.</p>
<p>We're a fan of the color – <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10848&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Trophy Blue</a>. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-c2-corvette/">C2 Corvette</a> was offered in a few different shades of light blue during its production run, and we're fans of all of them. The auction listing states that just 1,463 Trophy Blue Corvettes were built in 1966.</p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10848&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1966 Corvettes</a> look almost identical to the 1965 model save for two small changes. The first is the grille. While 1963-1965 models featured a series of horizontal bars, 1966 marked the changeover to an egg crate grille insert.</p>
<p>You'll also find a small "<a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10848&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Sting Ray</a>" emblem on the corner of the hood behind the driver's side front headlight. The side vents and rocker trim would change for 1967, making it easy to tell a 1966 apart from other years.</p>
