<p>Before Arnold Schwarzenegger spearheaded the case for public ownership of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Hummer">Hummer</a>’s military colossus, the H1 earned its stripes as an automotive equivalent of Chuck Norris – it could go anywhere and leave a trail of destruction in its wake. Especially if driven through town, where that tank-derived wheelbase caused all manner of masonry damage.</p>

Since then, the vehicle has become the face of American armed forces.</p>

<p>Although designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport stationed on the front line, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Humvee+">Humvee</a> soon garnished its indestructible reputation courtesy of relatively low damage reports throughout conventional operations, such as the Gulf War. Not a single news bulletin went out during that time without footage of a Humvee proving its worth. <br><br>Naturally, this caught the attention of various A-list celebrities from Hollywood’s overpaid dreamland. It also ticked the boxes for various egomaniacs who wanted something to turn heads or increase their media profile. This wasted the vehicle’s sheer engineering aptitude to no end.</p>

<p>Power flowed from a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 that churned out 205bhp. This might not sound like much, but the torque band allowed sheer rock faces to be traversed with the correct approach angle. <br><br>Besides such incredible drivetrain grunt, further engineering prowess showcased self-inflating/deflating tires for use on thick sand. Perfect for cruising down Sunset Boulevard, naturally, when AM General began selling civilian versions to the public under the new ‘Hummer’ marque during 1992.</p>

<p>The Hummer name soon became a laughing stock within car circles. Famed for hauling questionable public figures and luminaries around from golf course to restaurant, the hard-earned reputation for defending the nation fell by the wayside in favor of tacky paparazzi nonsense. <br><br>So, should you hanker after a (rather large) chunk of American automotive history, you’ll want to steer well clear of the 'Hollywood editions' and instead purchase an ex-Army hero that’s served time of the highest military order. Or an example that, at the very least, pays homage to the hardcore genesis Humvee. Such as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/149354/2000-hummer-h1">this one</a>.</p>
