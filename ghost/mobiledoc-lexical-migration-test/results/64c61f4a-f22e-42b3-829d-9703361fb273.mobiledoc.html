<p>Good things are happening! Anti-establishment Democrats scored victories in major local and state elections. What‚Äôs more, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Ind.-Vt.) are taking on the disastrously corrupt airline industry, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is going after bank fees, and new research highlights the benefits of Los Angeles‚Äô school construction boom that started in the late 1990s. </p>

<p>It was a banner week for anti-establishment candidates. In Colorado, Elisabeth Epps, a Denver Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)-backed criminal justice organizer and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-americas-top-gun-problem-also-elisabeth-epps-vs-corporate-interests/">friend of <em>The Lever</em></a>, overcame establishment opposition and hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending against her to win a Democratic primary for state legislature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Illinois, state Rep. Delia Ramirez <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-3rd-congressional-district-delia-ramierez-primary-election-results-2022-gilbert-villegas/12002610/">trounced</a> her right-wing opponent Gil Villegas in Illinois‚Äô newly created Hispanic-majority 3rd Congressional District. Ramirez was <a href="https://www.deliaforcongress.com/endorsements">backed</a> by Sanders and the Working Families Party.</p>
<p>Also in Illinois, DSA member Rachel Ventura won in a suburban Chicago district for state Senate, along with DSA member Anthony Quezada in a Cook County commissioner race.</p>
<p>Finally, upstate New York elected its first-ever socialist to the state Assembly, with the <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/news/article/Sarahana-Shrestha-defeats-incumbent-Kevin-Cahill-17273138.php">victory</a> of Nepali-American organizer Sarahana Shrestha over 13-term incumbent Kevin Cahill. This Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelangeloP_/status/1542254753966612482">thread</a> by a Shrestha staffer shows how they pulled it off.</p>
<h3 id="fetterman-and-bernie-take-on-mayor-pete">Fetterman And Bernie Take On Mayor Pete</h3>
<p>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spent his 2020 presidential campaign being <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/4/18290753/pete-buttigieg-bernie-sanders-filibuster-electoral-college-supreme-court">feted</a> by the corporate media as a candidate who wanted to ‚Äúmake governing great again.‚Äù Yet under his leadership at the Department of Transportation, there‚Äôs been an extraordinary supply chain crisis, and now, thousands of canceled flights. In response, Sanders and Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman have called on Buttigieg to take action by <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/06/29/sanders-fetterman-urge-buttigieg-fine-airlines-over-flight-cancellations">heavily</a> fining airlines for canceled flights due to staffing shortages.</p>

<p>Buttigieg has not responded to their demands, offering these vague <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1542663911526350850">comments</a> instead on Thursday: ‚ÄúWe have a number of tools and authorities and we‚Äôre prepared to use them. I‚Äôd rather not have it come to that, but when those issues happen we will act.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="chopra-chops-down-on-bank-fees">Chopra Chops Down On Bank Fees</h3>
<p><em>The</em><em>Washington Post </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/01/cfpb-rohit-chopra-financial-services-regulation/">profiled</a> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Chair Rohit Chopra, who is in the midst of a 9-month-old investigation into hidden fees charged by banks and credit card companies. While the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has launched an aggressive ad campaign against the consumer advocate, the <em>Post </em>noted that Chopra isn‚Äôt backing down from his pledge ‚Äúthat the days of slap-on-the-wrist fines are over, and that repeat offenders will face serious financial consequences.‚Äù</p>
<p>Chopra is also clear-eyed about the hurdles he faces. ‚ÄúI think the largest firms are much more accustomed to having a relationship with their regulators that is more akin to friendship than to a traditional relationship between a regulator and a regulated entity,‚Äù he told the<em> Post</em>.</p>
<h3 id="big-surprise-building-safe-new-schools-helped-la-kids">Big Surprise: Building Safe New Schools Helped L.A. Kids</h3>
<p>In a new study published in the <em>American Economic Journal</em>, Julien Lafortune and David Sch√∂nholzer <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20200467">found</a> that between 1997 and 2008, Los Angeles students saw substantial test score gains following voters‚Äô approval of $20 billion in new school bonds. While the average age of school buildings nationwide increased during that time, L.A. was building safe new schools ‚Äî many of them in low-income neighborhoods. Turns out that investing in kids pays off.</p>

<h3 id="upenn-teamsters-win-big">UPenn Teamsters Win Big</h3>
<p>Housekeepers, custodians, and transportation workers at the University of Pennsylvania haven‚Äôt waged a real fight for a new contract in decades ‚Äî largely thanks to the reluctance of their local union leadership to wage an aggressive campaign. So the workers did it themselves, with a <a href="https://www.tdu.org/upenn-teamsters-defeat-2tier?fbclid=IwAR1lm2YAL4joDkODHiBQNKmVbopYn44W77BWKsyWShmwBn_oZteHFdohMys">little help</a> from Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a pressure group that helps Teamsters make their union member-run.</p>
<p>Workers got their colleagues involved, made clear to their leaders they were ready to fight, and were able to eliminate the two-tier wage structure that made it so younger workers could never catch up in pay with their more senior colleagues. Now every housekeeper, TDU reports, will have the same top rate of $28.68 per hour by the end of the contract in 2026.</p>
