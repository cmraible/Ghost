<hr>
<p>A group of three <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/188532/2015-dodge-challenger-srt-hellcat">Dodge Challengers</a> were spotted street racing in Navarro County, Texas, and when they were made aware of the presence of law enforcement, all three drivers decided to flee and lead police on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/379901/prochargers-sema-dodge-challenger-stolen">wild high-speed chase</a>. At times, speeds of 170 miles per hour were clocked as the chase spanned through two Texas counties.</p>
<p>One of the cars was a<a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/188004/2017-dodge-challenger-r-t-392"> Dodge Challenger SRT8 392</a>, with the last number regarding the displacement of the 392cui V8 engine that has an output of 470-horsepower and produces the same amount of torque. This particular Challenger model tops of at 182 miles per hour, and it can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds, according to Dodge.</p>
<p>In an effort to evade the cops that were hot on their tails, all three drivers exited the interstate. That is when two of the cars were ultimately stopped, both drivers were apprehended, and the officers recovered both drugs and cash.</p>
<p>The third <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/163706/2015-dodge-challenger-r-t-scat-pack">Challenger </a>escaped police and still remains at large. The car he was driving was found abandoned in Teague, Texas and is believed to have been stolen from a dealership in Dallas.</p>
<p>One of the caught drivers was heading east on State Highway 84 when the driver lost control of the car and spun out. Deputies immediately blocked the car, but the driver tried to push against one of the police Tahoes. The suspect then bailed from the vehicle and ran through a Sam's parking lot, but the officers were able to catch him. Upon apprehension, the deputies discovered liquid narcotics and $2,250, and the driver will face a long list of charges including aggravated assault on a public servant, evading police, possession of a controlled substance, manufacturing and delivery of a controlled substance, false or fictitious registration, and possession of marijuana.</p>
