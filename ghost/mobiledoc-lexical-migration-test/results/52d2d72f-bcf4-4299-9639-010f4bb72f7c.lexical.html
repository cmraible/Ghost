<hr>
<p>The idea that a restomod has to be from the muscle car era or feature showy modifications is disproven by this unique <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/402/1948-buick-roadmaster?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1948 Buick Roadmaster</a> convertible. This Buick will be up for auction through <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Raleigh Classic Car Auctions</a>, and that vintage body hides a handful of important modern upgrades. </p>

<p>This Buick has undergone a complete frame-off restoration leaving the exterior of this vintage drop top exuding its usual timeless late-'40s style. While we only get to see a single shot of the outside, it's clear how impressive the build quality is with smooth black pain, clean body gaps bright chrome and wire wheels wrapped in white-wall tires. From this view, you'd think this 1948 Buick Roadmaster was restored back to factory specs, but the description tells another story.</p>
<p>From the factory, that long hood originally housed a 320 cubic-inch straight-eight engine, but today this car is powered by a fuel-injected 454 cubic-inch big-block V8. That should provide more than enough power for this big car, while giving it a satisfying rumble. Adding to the restomod upgrades, this Buick is ready to master the road with an automatic transmission, power disc brakes and power steering.</p>
<p>Inside reveals similar restomod status with a modern luxury car interior with light tan leather, power seats and air conditioning. The billet steering column, banjo steering wheel and aftermarket gauges give this 1948 Buick Roadmaster a hotrod-style interior, while the custom lower console housing the air conditioning vents and stereo system have a clean appearance.</p>
<p>It will be crossing the auction block at the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Raleigh Classic Car Auctions</a>' <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/register-to-bid&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Summer 2020 Raleigh Classic</a>, which takes place August 21-22, so be sure you're <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/register-to-bid?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">registered to bid</a>.</p>
