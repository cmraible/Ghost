These pictures don't do the color justice, but this 560 is painted in Blue Black metallic lacquer finish, and the interior is absolutely immaculate with the gray leather and wood trim. As expected from a car that has been this babied, there doesn't appear to be any wear in this cabin, and the car looks stunning inside and out thanks to a recent detail."

Bottom line, this car is as ready for a quiet night to the theater as it is blasting down the autobahn."
