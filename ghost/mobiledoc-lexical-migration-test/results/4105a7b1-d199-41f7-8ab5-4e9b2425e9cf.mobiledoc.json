Despite all the shortages, inflation, and the other craziness of last year, that was more than the 54,314 sold during the craziness of 2021. That’s impressive and probably driven in part by the rumored impending doom of the nameplate."

Gone will be the Hemi V8s, replaced by an inline-six twin-turbo setup that while it might be good, just isn’t as good as the Hemis. So in this respect Dodge has an unfair advantage which should run out at the end of this year."

We bet Ford is happy to hear the Hemi V8 is going away, possibly allowing the Mustang to reign supreme in the segment once more come 2024."

To be clear, we’re not saying GM’s muscle car is bad, but for whatever set of reasons people just aren’t buying them. That could be why supposedly a crossover and sedan will be joining the Camaro lineup in the future."
