The problem the news business has is that high-quality free news is *significantly *easier to find than free music, and is legal, too. Making it harder to find wouldn’t just require all the existing newspapers to push their content behind a paywall, but all the related bloggers and other community publishers, too. If that doesn’t happen, there just isn’t a compelling gap in the market for a paid approach to making news easier to find.\n\n**Update: **There’s an interview with [Anderson about his views on the future of news](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/07/28/wired/index.html) on Salon.\n\n</div>\n"
