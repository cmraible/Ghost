On top of that, twin turbochargers Force air into all six cylinders to produce what the listing says is “ four times the output of the original standard 6 cylinder and double the optional V8 engine.”  All of that power is then sent through a six-speed automatic transmission and, of course, a dual-range transfer case which will make off-roading in four-wheel drive more than possible for a good driver.",
