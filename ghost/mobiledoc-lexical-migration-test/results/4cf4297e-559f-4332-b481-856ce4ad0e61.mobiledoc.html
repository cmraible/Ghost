<p>They launched with a focused week of coverage - from 15th to 23rd September 2019 - to lead into the UN Climate Change Summit. The wanted to partner with as many news organisations as they could. They had take-up from news agencies, TV networks, newspapers and magazines. They also worked with individual experts. They ended up with over 300 partners.</p>
<p>The partners leant into their specialities - for example, <em>Bloomberg</em> looked at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-19/climate-change-and-low-interest-rates-could-derail-retirement">climate change and retirement</a>. They also took tangential takes - like the <em>Daily Beast</em> covering the idea that <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/climate-activists-dont-know-how-to-talk-to-christians">climate change activists aren't using the right language to talk to Christians</a>.</p>

<h3 id="1-we-don-t-know-where-to-start">1. "We don't know where to start"</h3>
<p>Some major news organisations genuinely don't know how to get started with this sort of reporting. How can we help equip them?</p>
<h3 id="2-our-viewers-will-think-we-re-activists">2. "Our viewers will think we're activists"</h3>
<p>A particular challenge for some TV networks, and the US in particular, is the idea that reporting these issues accurately looks like advocacy. That's a function of a particular political moments - but can we resist the pressure from a reactionary audience?</p>
<h3 id="3-it-s-too-late-the-problem-is-too-big-for-us-to-make-a-difference-">3. "It's too late; the problem is too big for us to make a difference."</h3>
<p>Journalisst <em>like</em> making a difference. This is both stupid AND wrong, according to science.</p>
<h3 id="4-readers-will-find-this-depressing-and-tune-out-">4. "Readers will find this depressing and tune out."</h3>
<p>Maragret Sullivan said that climate change is a <em>fantastic story</em> and if you can't tell it, you shouldn't be a journalists.</p>
<h3 id="5-we-re-already-pulling-our-weight-">5. "We're already pulling our weight."</h3>
<p>OK. But could you share your practices and help others do better on this?</p>
<p>There is a perspective that it's a rating killer - that hasn't proved to be the case. Climate change is now more searched on Google than climate change.</p>
