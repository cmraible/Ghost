          ", there is no way of knowing that, which hampers the exploration somewhat. There is also a button to press as a shortcut to bring the map up; it was implied that this was the right stick but in the version I played (Switch), it was in fact the left stick (I'm not sure if that will be corrected on release). As a result, there were quite a few occasions where I found myself accidentally bringing up the map in the middle of some intense combat. Surely one of the unused buttons would have made more sense?"
