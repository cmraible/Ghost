<p>Don’t speed in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-crashes-house/">Canada</a>, that’s the lesson to be learned after a C8 Corvette driver was pulled over in Saanich, Vancouver Island, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/teen-solves-27-year-mystery/">British Columbia</a> for going twice the legal limit and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-gets-impounded/">had the car impounded</a>. According to a Twitter post by Saanich Police on March 11, the C8 was clocked going 100 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, hence <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">the harsh treatment</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you who aren’t good at conversions, 50 km/h is about 31 mph, so 100 km/h is about 62 mph. So keep in mind in Canada that doing 30 over in a 60 mph zone is enough to get your car towed and impounded, everyone. Fear the maple leaf, fear it!</p>
<p>At least on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wisconsin-rioters-loot/">Twitter</a>, people seem to be all for this treatment of such a scofflaw. For example, one user replied “Just send it to auction and take away the driver’s license #RoadSafet #SpeedKills.” We doubt this person would appreciate the famous Jeremy Clarkson quote on speed not killing since it’s the sudden stopping that actually gets you.</p>
<p>Others on Twitter had “useful” advice for this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gm-copied-ferrari-458/">C8</a> owner. One counseled, “When are they going to learn that if they want to show off their car they have to drive slowly. (sic) That way people can get a good look at it and have time to admire it. Thus (sic) inflating the drivers (sic) ego, which is what those cars are all about anyway.” Oh yes, they have car culture all figured out, definitely (insert super sarcastic voice here).</p>
<p>And thus we see that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/non-car-people/">non-gearheads just don’t live in reality</a>, yet they think they have us all figured out. Also, don’t speed on public roads. Take your car to the track to really experience the performance chops of your ride.</p>
