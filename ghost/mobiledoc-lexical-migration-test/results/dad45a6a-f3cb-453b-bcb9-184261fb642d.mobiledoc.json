Amantea, Founder and CEO of Collectors Xchange. “Smartphones are where business happens today, whether it’s checking messages or making a huge purchase, so we knew that we had to lead with mobility. And because trust is paramount when you’re considering spending money through an app, we also knew we needed to focus on transparency. Our CX Report is the key that we believe will drive that transparency and the comfort level required to motivate buyers and sellers to use our platform.” "
