Instead of just victimizing the owners of passenger vehicles, these criminals are also targeting tow truck companies while simultaneously giving them a bad reputation."

If you think about it, that kind of crime is pretty brazen since these thieves undoubtedly are operating in plain sight of quite a few people."

It’s like the home burglars who dress up as plumbers and drive a plumbing service truck so neighbors won’t assume anything is off as they go in and out of a house."

Police in areas racked by crime, like D.C., have a tough job since victims of car thefts believe theirs is a high-priority case worthy of dedicating diminished resources toward solving. The sad reality is with a slashed budget and workforce, these departments have to concentrate on surging homicides and hope prosecutors don’t just let suspects walk free to potentially murder more."

This does serve as a reminder that you need to take your own steps to secure your ride, like hiding tracking devices and maybe installing an alarm. None of these are guarantees, but they can help deter theft and allow you to track down your vehicle."
