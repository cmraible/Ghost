          "Introduced in September of 1964, the 1965 Mustang became an instant hit for the American automaker. What can be a tad confusing about the earliest Mustangs is that Ford released an earlier pace car version known as the 1964 1/2 six months prior, so the '65 model is considered late-model even though it is technically the first year of the car. Intended for two occupants, although it did seat four in the fold-down rear seat, this model is known as the \"2x2 fastback\". Even more, the sloping body would become the foundation for the Shelby GT350."

Stripped down to just a bare shell, the body was then media blasted. Any major sheetmetal panels that needed repairs were replaced with brand new pieces, and every piece of stainless steel and chrome were either replaced or refurbished. Now, this '65 Mustang is finished in a stunning bright silver paint over a Ford-spec dark red interior that is in showroom condition. Even all of the wiring is brand new."
