<hr>
<p>A 1977 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lamborghini-countach-basement/">Lamborghini Countach</a> LP 400 Periscopio <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/musicians-car-collection/">once owned</a> by Rod Stewart was auctioned on February 13 in Paris for a cool $940, 919, setting a new record for an auctioned Countach. Some are already declaring the beginning of the age of million-dollar Lamborghini Countaches as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/actually-the-kids-like-classic-cars/">nostalgia among Gen Xers and Millennials</a> runs high. Plus, with the new normal of everyone being cooped up at home while local businesses die on the vine, people seem to be turning more and more to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/maxim-recognizes-classic-supercars-are-a-great-investment/">classic cars for a diversion</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out a barn find Lotus Esprit S2 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-lotus-esprit-s2/"><em>here</em></a>. </em></blockquote>
<p>The Countach has been fully restored to its original condition, including the Periscopio roof. It’s 1 of 157 LP400s built with the Periscopio roof which features a notch lined up with the rearview mirror for improved visibility. Countaches aren’t exactly known for their rearward visibility. Stewart <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/james-hetfield-shows-off-his-car-collection/">had the car converted</a> to a targa with the help of Albert Madikian Engineering.</p>
<p>We’re guessing Rod Stewart really wanted to feel the wind ripple through his luscious locks, something he didn’t get to enjoy while driving the car in Australia during his concert tour and recorded the album Blondes Have More Fun in Sydney. When he imported it to Los Angeles the musician not only had the roof changed but also many cosmetic features added from newer Countach models. All that has now been undone.</p>

<p>In addition, a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV crossed the block at the same auction in Paris and sold for a whopping $2,942.650. That’s was good enough to set a record for the highest auction price for a Miura. It’s an exceptional example, for sure, with a certification from Lamborghini Polo Storico with the black certification box and all associated documents. The supercar also went through a full Jota conversion. Keep in mind only 150 Miuras were made and many consider it to be the first true supercar ever.</p>
<p>Both cars were part of the RM Sotheby’s Paris 2021 auction.</p>
