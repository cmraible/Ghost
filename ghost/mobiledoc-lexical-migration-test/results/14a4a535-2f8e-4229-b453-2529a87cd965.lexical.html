<p>It's not uncommon for someone to get over their head in a project and abandon the whole thing, but usually it's a rust bucket that needs lots repairs or hard-to-find parts. That definitely isn't the case with this <a href="https://www.streetdreamstexas.com/vehicles/473/1953-chevrolet-3100-5-window-cab-project-roadster-shop-chassis-new-sheet-metal?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious"><strong>1953 Chevrolet 3100</strong></a> five-window pickup truck that is an amazingly blank canvas for someone to finish and put their own custom touch on.</p>
<p>If this project sounds like something you want to take on, <a href="https://www.streetdreamstexas.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious"><strong>Street Dreams</strong></a> currently has the truck listed for $27,500. Considering the provided receipts show the chassis alone is worth $20,000 and the brand-new sheet metal is another $14,000, this is a great price!</p>

<p>The bones of this truck are extremely solid with a brand-new the Roadster Shop fully-boxed chassis, and it comes with motor mounts for just about any Chevy engine you could dream up (small-block, big block or LS) as well as CNC mounting locations for the body, bumpers and core support.</p>
<p>For the perfect Pro Touring setup, this truck has an independent front suspension and four-link rear suspension. You get Baer 11-inch drilled and slotted brakes and single adjustable coilovers at all four wheels, and there's a Ford nine-inch rear end with 3.7 gears and posi traction.</p>

<p>The cab is brand new with a smoothed and recessed firewall, and all the rest of the body from Premier Street Rods is still boxed up as is the aluminum radiator. This truck is being offered with the choice of Coker white wall tires with steel wheels or Coys 20-inch chrome wheels.</p>
<p>Why buy a rusty or bondo-covered project truck when you can pick up this clean-slate five window for a song?
