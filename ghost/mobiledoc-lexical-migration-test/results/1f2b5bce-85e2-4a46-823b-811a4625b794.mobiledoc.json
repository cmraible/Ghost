You might have read about the Peter Max Collection, a group of Corvettes collected by an eccentric artist and hidden away in New York City for years on end. The collection has one of every model year the Corvette was made, starting with 1953 and ending with 1989. It was originally the grand prize for a giveaway on cable TV network VH1. Max bought the cars off the winner and planned to use them in an art project that never came about, and so they sat in one location and then another since the late 80s."
