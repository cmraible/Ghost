<p>This 27-mile drive ZR1 was prepped to be a collectible from day one, being stored and documented with all paperwork. This is the kind of bright red supercar that can cause a stir even at the fickle NCRS events, and its possibly the lowest mileage <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/5592-atl/1995-chevrolet-corvette-zr1??utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1995 ZR1</a> around. </p>
<p>In addition to being extremely low-mileage, <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/5592-atl/1995-chevrolet-corvette-zr1??utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this example</a> has the kind of red paint job that jumps out at you. It has a color-matched targa top and optional translucent roof panel, and is essentially fully loaded. </p>
