<hr>
<p>According to a local report, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-z06-driver-crashes/">Chevrolet Corvette crashed</a> into a Comerica Bank on Detroit’s west side the evening of May 10, destroying the security doors and breaking windows. At first glance that might sound like the perfect plot to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bloody-bank-robbery-getaway-car/">break into a bank</a> after hours, but fortunately that wasn’t the case here. Instead, authorities indicated it might have been a case of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-police-chase/">driving under the influence</a>, but the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-cold-case-murder/">C4 Corvette</a> driver doesn’t look to be the one at fault.</p>
<blockquote><em>You could score your own custom C4 Corvette by helping crack a cold case murder. Find out more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-cold-case-murder/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, the C4 Corvette was hit by another car. At the scene of the accident, a news crew captured video of a young woman being put through a field sobriety test. Reportedly, after the Chevy was hit, the 60-year-old driver struggled to regain control of the sports car, which ended up crashing through fencing and into the bank. This proves that even if you’re driving as safely as can be, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1956-plymouth-belvedere-wrecked/">someone else who isn’t can put you in harm’s way</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of harm, the local report indicated the driver of the Chevy Corvette was in serious condition after the crash. Hopefully he pulls through no problem, but the other driver could be facing criminal and civil penalties when the dust settles. The lesson to be learned here is if you’re going to drinking or consuming anything else which impairs you, don’t drive afterward.</p>

<p>We don’t know what kind of car the other driver was in, but we’re assuming it wasn’t anything the least bit interesting. Had it been something like a Dodge Charger, there’s little doubt it would’ve been as highly featured in the news report as the C4 Corvette.</p>
<p>Fortunately, damage to the ‘Vette doesn’t look too bad, although only one angle of the sports car is shown in the video, and it’s not of the side which collided with the building. Still, we wouldn’t be surprised if the Chevy is ready to be driven again in a short time.</p>
