That’s right, it’s a Harley-Davidson with a cab of sorts built around it, four wheels behind the front wheel, plus a trailer with another four wheels at the rear. Plus, there are dual smokestacks and other finishes to make it look like a mini-semi, if such a thing were to exist. This thing has been famous for some time, but even if you’ve seen it before you might not know much about its origins."

          "Back in 1989, Kenny Kilpatrick and his wife Jane had a dream: to build a Harley-powered rig. The couple, who lived in Alabama, fabricated what would become the 9-Wheel Harley Rig, finishing the job in 1990. As you might imagine, the thing immediately turned plenty of heads and got people talking."

That was a smart move some companies would’ve torpedoed out of some uptight fear of the unknown. Instead, Harley let this incredibly unique machine become a rolling billboard for its brand, which seems to have worked out well."
