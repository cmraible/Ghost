This pro-touring Corvette definitely took inspiration from other Chevrolet performance vehicles with the chevron-shaped heat extractor from the newer Camaro and the center-mounted, quadruple exhaust outlets like the C5-C7 Corvette. Inside, there's even more modern amenities like the custom red leather seats, Momo steering wheel, Vintage air and Kenwood sound system, but this cabin still has the same basic look and feel of a late C1 'Vette."

For optimal handling and packaging, this build uses a C4 Corvette rear suspension setup with C6 Z06 brakes. Best of all, this custom, pro-touring 1962 Chevrolet Corvette has just 52 miles on it since being constructed!"
