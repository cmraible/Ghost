<p>Rolling out the Plymouth plant 51 years ago, wearing a shade of Sable White (Code W) with a matching white soft top over white interior trim, <a href="https://www.garagekeptmotors.com/vehicles/736/1968-plymouth-gtx-440-convertible?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this GTX 440</a> is powered by the original 440cid V8 unit churning out 375bhp. Those horses flow through a console shifted 3-speed automatic transmission, supplying all the grunt you could need for an ice-cool image.</p>
<p>Although nowhere near as quick as its contemporary stablemates, the GTX holds far more class than a modern muscle car. While the Plymouth marque may have died on June 28, 2001, its GTX mantra remains revered in collector car circles; that of '<em>The Gentleman’s Muscle Car</em>'.</p>

<p>While the GTX had plenty of power on tap upon putting the foot down, it traded the neck-breaking traits of its peers for refined touches – such as power windows, a power convertible top, and air conditioning. All of which still functions as they should with the example from <a href="https://www.garagekeptmotors.com/vehicles/736/1968-plymouth-gtx-440-convertible?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Garage Kept Motors</a>.</p>
<p>According to the advert, the car also features wood trim, power window switches in all seating areas, front bucket seats, a center console, Coker redline tires, full spare tire, dual exhaust, dome lighting, original AM/FM radio, and boot cover. Perhaps more importantly than all that, the frame remains rust free!</p>
