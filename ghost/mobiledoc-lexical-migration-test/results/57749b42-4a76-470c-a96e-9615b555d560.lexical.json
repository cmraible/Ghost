Tab called for help and when her husband and son got on the scene, their priority was instantly to spring into action to save the house. Thanks to their quick thinking and the fire departments in Lorraine, Mannsville, Adams and Adams Center, the home was saved with only suffering from minimal damage to the house's siding.",
