In the century since, the sea has steadily eroded what’s left.<p>We visited the village at the tail end of our stay. The sea has claimed the walkway down to the village in the last decade, leaving it inaccessible to visitors. These photos were taken on the walk to and from the observation platform.</p>
<p>I’m glad I went. In another decade, I doubt many of the buildings in these pictures will still exist.</p>
<p>You can see the rest of my pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adders/sets/197763/">here</a> and read more about the village <a href="http://www.hallsands.org.uk/">here</a>.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
