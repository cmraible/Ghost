However, we found a rumor that doesn’t seem complete vapid and could be at least mostly accurate. The word is a hybrid gas-electric Ford Mustang is coming, something we’ve heard before, and it’s supposed to still use a 5.0-liter V8."

You don’t have to like this development, but we think this could be a huge boon for the Mustang, which lately has been getting trounced by the Dodge Challenger."

It would be paired with the 10-speed automatic transmission we’ve seen in plenty of other Ford products. Supposedly, all-wheel drive is also on the table, a move which makes sense since the Dodge Challenger offers that and for some shoppers that’s undoubtedly a deal breaker."

Others seem to interpret the document as stating the hybrid powertrains would be introduced for the 2025 model year. Until an official announcement is made by Ford, exactly what the automaker is planning will remain a mystery while people continue to speculate. However, we think it’s safe to assume Ford plans on transforming the Mustang significantly with the launch of the S650."
