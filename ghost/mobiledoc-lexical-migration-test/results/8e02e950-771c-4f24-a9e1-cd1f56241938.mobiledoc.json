The hope is that we will help readers be more aware of the need to secure their rides. There’s also the chance someone will recognize a stolen vehicle and it will be recovered. For that reason we’re happy to give coverage to this story out of Tulsa County, Oklahoma where a classic Ford pickup was stolen and then returned."

Thieves took it the Wednesday before Christmas, which is a real Grinch move. While it’s awful to steal someone else’s ride at any time of the year, doing it right before Christmas is just being an extra big jerk."

Of course, the thieves didn’t care about that, they just saw a way to get a quick score. Not only were all the mother and son’s belongings inside, so were the husband’s ashes. Again, this is why we think people who steal vehicles are so scummy."
