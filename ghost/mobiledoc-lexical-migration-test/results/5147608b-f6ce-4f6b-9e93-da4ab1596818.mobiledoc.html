<p>Although the Duke of Richmond’s name may not be universally known, his classic racing events certainly are. As the owner of the Goodwood Estate and founder of both the <em>Goodwood Festival of Speed</em> and the<em> Goodwood Revival</em> in 1993 and 1998, respectfully, the Duke remains one of the world’s greatest stewards of motor racing history.</p>
<p>Instrumental in building the modern concept of vintage racing events, the Duke has promoted a mantra responsible for keeping automotive heritage alive. With decades of experience, influence and expertise under his belt, the new addition to the Board should prove to be a guiding light for the museum’s future development.</p>
