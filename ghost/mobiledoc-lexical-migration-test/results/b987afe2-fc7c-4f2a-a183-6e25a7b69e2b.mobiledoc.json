Perhaps that matchup will be coming later."

First off, the most obvious one is the Jag is a luxury vehicle and cost quite a bit more, at least here in the US. With all that lovely leather and such, it also tips the scales about 500 lbs. more than the Chevy, which admittedly has a pretty crappy interior. But we’re talking about speed, not how pampered you feel. On paper, the C5 Corvette outguns the XK8 by about 60-horsepower and 90 lb.-ft. of torque, so already things don’t look great for the Jag."
