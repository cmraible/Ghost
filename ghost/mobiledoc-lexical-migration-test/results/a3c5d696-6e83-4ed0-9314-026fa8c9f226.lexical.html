<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week, <em>The Lever</em>’s podcast network covered a lot of ground. On <em>Lever Time,</em> our reporters discussed exposing the cartoonish corruption of Republican Senate candidate Ted Budd. We also spoke with a legal expert on how bankruptcy court is quickly becoming big corporations' “get-out-of-jail-free” card. On <em>The Audit</em>, our intrepid study group continues their slog through Dubya’s MasterClass, learning how the former president put together his elite team… of ruthless Neocons.</p>

<p>The study group kicks off this week’s episode with a discussion about a moment of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corruption-caught-on-tape/">open corruption caught on tape</a> during a congressional committee hearing, and how it crystalizes the sorry state of our current politics.</p>
<p>Then, the group unpacks Dubya’s important lessons on team-building and decision-making. Specifically, how he diligently built a team full of ruthless, corrupt Neocons and how his decisive decision-making after 9/11 led to the devastating and unnecessary wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
