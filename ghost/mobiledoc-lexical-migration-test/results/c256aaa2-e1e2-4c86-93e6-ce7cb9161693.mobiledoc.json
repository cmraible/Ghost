An unequal wishbone style front and rear suspension featured Bilstien electronically adaptive dampers for unmatched handling and a powerful race-derived 4.7-liter V-12 engine supplied 512 naturally aspirated horsepower. Implementing what it had learned on the racetrack, Ferrari brought all of these technologies together in a limited production 3K-lbs streetcar- the Ferrari F50."

On top of this extremely limited production, the cars were not really sold new but rather leased in an unusual manner designed to prevent the cars from being used to make mass profits shortly after delivery. All of this lends to the F50’s rarity and boosts its collectibility today."
