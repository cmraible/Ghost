<p>One assumes when a new car rolls <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-production-yet-again/">out of the factory</a>, having passed through quality control, that everything on it is as correct as possible at the time. Sure, recalls might happen later as the automaker learns some design or manufacturing process was indeed faulty, but the assumption is your vehicle will be factory spec in every way. That apparently isn’t the case with all the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2023-corvettes-production/">2023 C8 Corvettes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>See what’s left of a Corvette that wrecked out big in Texas <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-spins-out/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>A report from GM Authority claims certain 2023 Corvettes left Bowling Green Assembly without the correct suspension calibration. GM has issued a service update to dealers to let them know about the problem so it might be corrected.</p>
<p>The good news is the fix shouldn’t be too difficult since it just involves reprogramming the Electronic Suspension Control Module. That’s far better replacing any mechanical components. It only takes 12 minutes for a Corvette to be inspected to see if it has the wrong suspension settings, then another 18 minutes to reprogram the module. In other words, expect the dealer to have the car for about four to six hours when all is said and done.</p>

<p>Dealers are instructed by GM to correct the problem in any vehicle they have in their inventory, as well as customer vehicles when they come in for servicing. If you own a 2023 Chevy Corvette, whether it’s a Stingray or Z06, or know someone who does, it would be worth mentioning this next time you bring it to your preferred dealer’s service department.</p>
<p>We’re not going to attribute the rash of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/impatient-corvette-driver-wrecks/">Corvette crashes</a> we’ve been seeing lately to this suspension settings problem. First of all, that trend has been going on for a couple years or so, and not all the involved Corvettes are even C8s. But that’s not to say your C8 won’t handle like it should if the suspension settings are in fact off.</p>
