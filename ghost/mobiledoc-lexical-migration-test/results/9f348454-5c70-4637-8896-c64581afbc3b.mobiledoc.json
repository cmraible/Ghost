We are talking about the Woodward Dream Cruise, one of the world's largest one-day car events scheduled for August 15th, has been canceled due to the coronavirus. The cities on this signature road are hoping to officially cancel the event, and the results so far are not favoring a positive outcome for Woodward. In fact, after visiting the official Woodward Dream Cruise website, there is a message regarding the event. "
