However, there was one automobile that stood apart from all the rest that seemed completely odd for a thief to set his sights on. That vehicle is a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS, a car that is very highly respected within the classic American automotive industry. This does not take away from the suffering of those who had their ordinary cars stolen from them but rather serves as a particularly interesting subject for car guys everywhere. How this man was able to hide and store a beautiful bright red and very flamboyant muscle car for so long is a complete mystery but at least now the police have a potential and alleged suspect.",
