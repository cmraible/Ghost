<h2 id="podcasts-the-new-home-of-investigative-journalism">Podcasts: the new home of investigative journalism?</h2>
<p>In the midst of a fairly predictable opinion piece from a podcast platform staffer, this thought stood out: </p>
<blockquote>In recent years, we‚Äôve witnessed the financial investment in traditional journalism depreciate, and with it, the extent to which journalists are able to devote to in-depth investigations. But this hasn‚Äôt been the case in podcasting, as it‚Äôs quickly emerged as a new home of storytelling, with the high audience engagement in audio providing new editorial options. For example, investigative series The Teacher's Pet and The Lady Vanishes have captivated global audiences, with the episodic format of the podcasts allowing the creators to report in real-time on the podcasts.</blockquote>
<p>And, well, that's a <em>really</em> interesting point. Some investigative journalism lends itself really well to episodic storytelling, drawing the reader along with the journalist as they dig into a story. Podcasts are perfect for episodic storytelling.</p>
<p>Perfect match of story type to story platform. </p>

<h2 id="twitter-metrics-experiment">Twitter metrics experiment</h2>
<p>Twitter is experimenting with more prominently displaying the number of retweets with comments (quote tweets) that a Tweet has, calling them Quotes. I still think that these simple pieces of numerical social proof tend to incentivize attention-seeking behaviour, but we'll see if this makes a difference. </p>

<p>Some really good examples here of how treating social media as a place to <em>do</em> journalism or research can be more useful than seeing it as a place to <em>promote</em> journalism: </p>
