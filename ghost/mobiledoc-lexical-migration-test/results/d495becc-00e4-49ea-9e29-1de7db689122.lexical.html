<p>Almost two decades ago, the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sarbanesoxleyact.asp">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</a>, which imposed criminal penalties on executives who signed false financial statements, was signed into law. Gary Gensler, Biden’s pick to head the Securities and Exchange Commission played a key role in pushing that bill through, as a senior advisor to Senator Paul Sarbanes.</p>
<p>“Wall Street has never forgiven Gensler for that,” according to <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/01/wall-street-fears-gary-gensler-because-he-knows-too-much/">Wall Street On Parade.</a></p>
<h4 id="today-s-bit-of-news-"><strong>TODAY’S BIT OF NEWS:</strong></h4>
<p>Pete Buttigieg, Biden's pick for transportation secretary, <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/A6A0F97A42F47CF48525865F003178EB/$FILE/Buttigieg,%20Peter%20%20final278.pdf">noted</a> in his financial disclosure last week that he was a public representative with Win the Era, a dark money nonprofit, from April 2020 until last month.</p>
<p>When Buttigieg ended his presidential bid, his campaign committee reformed as Win the Era PAC. His allies also established a 501(c)(4) nonprofit called Win the Era Action Fund, which <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&contributor_name=win+the+era+action+fund&two_year_transaction_period=2020&min_date=01%2F01%2F2019&max_date=12%2F31%2F2020">has donated</a> $1.3 million to the PAC. Win the Era Action Fund hasn’t disclosed its donors, and it’s not clear where the group is incorporated.</p>
<p>Buttigieg’s ethics pledge <a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/870A7340FA5EED8F8525865F00317EEF/$FILE/Buttigieg,%20Peter%20%20finalEA.pdf">says</a> he “will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know Win the Era is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate.” What about the group’s donors?</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Biden and Buttigieg didn’t respond to questions from <em>The Daily Poster</em>. The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on Buttigieg’s nomination on Thursday.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HAPPY REVOLVING DOOR DAY: </strong>Hours before leaving office, <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-revokes-ethics-order-barring-former-aides-lobbying-82628c48-c840-4566-833e-c439272b5f6e.html">Trump revoked</a> an ethics order — that he himself had enacted — that prevented members of his administration from lobbying for five years. Meanwhile, the ethics rules that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-ethics-administration/2021/01/18/56a9a97a-59bd-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html">Biden plans</a> to enact are reportedly stronger than the Obama administration’s policies.</li>
    <li><strong>GO BIG OR GO HOME:</strong> It’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/20/biden-inauguration-president-midterms/">not too early</a> for Biden to think about the 2022 midterms, meaning he needs to deliver financial relief and be willing to pass it without Republican support. Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1351923938356391936?s=20">is pushing</a> to pass new survival checks and funding for vaccines as quickly as possible, while congressional Democrats are indicating that a broader stimulus package may not happen until March. Progressives will need to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/can-joe-biden-succeed-where-barack-obama-failed-1562265">organize and pressure Biden</a> to make it happen.</li>
    <li><strong>DEBIT CARD DISASTERS:</strong> Bank of America left thousands of unemployed Californians without payments because of a botched rollout of a system to provide benefits on debit cards. One lawyer <a href="https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2021/01/bank-of-america-sued-over-edd-unemployment-debit-card-fraud/">said</a> the bank “did not provide even basic security measures to protect EDD cardholders.” People who received their stimulus payments on debit cards have also faced fees and <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/government-contractors-nickel-and-diming-coronavirus-relief-recipients/">other problems.</a> Distributing government benefits, as it turns out, is a <a href="https://prospect.org/power/big-banks-cashing-food-stamps/">big industry</a> for banks.</li>
    <li><strong>GIG WORKERS: </strong>One of the most important things that Biden can do for working people is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/opinion/proposition-22-california-biden.html">undo Trump-era rules</a> that classified gig workers as contractors, and invalidate Prop 22, a ballot measure in California that is already <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/prop-22-is-here-already-worse-than-expected-california-gig-workers/">stripping protections</a> from thousands of workers. One worrisome sign, though, is that Biden has <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-anita-dunn-to-join-white-house-as-senior-adviser-6c3f8831-38af-4bd5-8d48-4c1b64addefe.html">hired Anita Dunn</a>, whose consulting firm <a href="https://twitter.com/GigWorkersRise/status/1350153249135841281?s=20">is leading</a> a front group for big tech companies <a href="https://public-accountability.org/report/how-uber-and-lyft-are-preparing-to-block-labor-rights-for-gig-economy-workers-in-new-york-and-around-the-country/">pushing to limit</a> gig worker protections in New York.</li>
