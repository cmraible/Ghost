<p>When the Walt Disney Company built a development in Celebration, Florida, in the 1990s, it was advertised as “a place that takes you back to that time of innocence.” But if that vision was ever even possible, it would ultimately completely unravel.</p>
<p>“Celebration was supposed to be a corrective to one of the prevailing anxieties on the eve of the new millennium: that people were more alienated, less connected, less happy,” wrote Gaby Del Valle in a new piece for <em>The Drift </em>that we highlight below<em>. </em>“But Celebration was, at its core, a conventional real estate development masquerading as a utopia. And the minute Disney realized it could get a better return on its investment by selling Celebration for parts, it did.”</p>
<p>In addition to a recap of <em>The Lever</em>’s reporting this week, this edition of Lever Weekly features reporting on the widespread use of unpaid labor in prisons, and on the reasons that President Joe Biden should nationalize the oil industry, instead of issuing gentle guidance.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-declares-war-on-workers/"><strong>To Fight Inflation, The Fed Declares War On Workers</strong></a></strong> — <em>“Does the Fed chairman really mistakenly believe that wages are driving inflation? If not, Powell — a mega-wealthy private equity mogul and a Republican — might have just validated an argument long made by progressives: that a key driver of the central bank’s interest rate policies is actually to suppress labor power.”</em></p>

The rule is supposed to be developed and implemented by six regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve that Powell runs. But as he has sounded the alarm about inflation and wages, Powell has so far has done nothing to help create that rule, even as Wall Street bonuses just hit an all-time record at $45 billion in a single year.”</em></p>

I’m Back.”</strong></a></strong>— <em>“Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in June 2018 amid a cloud of ethics scandals, seemingly too corrupt even for the Trump administration. Now he is attempting to regain a position in the government — despite the fact that he has continued to make questionable moves on behalf of the oil and gas industry since leaving his post.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cheat-sheet-blackout-summer/"><strong>CHEAT SHEET: Blackout Summer</strong></a></strong>— <em>“This summer is expected to bring more widespread power outages around the world than any year in recent history.

In many ways, this makes Disney just like any other private housing developer.”</em></p>

His Government Should Take Over the Industry Instead.</strong></a></strong> (The New Republic) — <em>“Virtually every other major oil producing country on earth has some say over how their natural resources are exploited and refined, making the U.S. something of an outlier in having to go begging to combative CEOs.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://ballsandstrikes.org/newsletter/the-supreme-court-has-had-fox-news-brain-for-a-long-time/"><strong>The Supreme Court Has Had Fox News Brain For a Long Time</strong></a></strong>(Balls and Strikes) — <em>“On December 4 — the same day the Court issued its first opinion in Bush v. Gore — [Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor] absolutely teed off on the Gore campaign at a private party in Washington. ‘You just don’t know what those Gore people have been doing,” said O’Connor, a Republican appointee, whom [author Jeffrey Toobin] describes as ‘livid’ and speaking ‘with fervor.’ ‘They went into a nursing home and registered people that they shouldn’t have. It was outrageous.’”</em></p>
