We imagine it was cherished by the owner, however it was only driven for a mere 7 years before being parked in a garage. There the Japanese car sat until 2016. Then a guy named Derek saw value in it and bought the car, only for it to sit in his barn for 6 years. Finally, after 44 years of just sitting and gathering grime, the classic is getting a thorough, professional detailing to bring out what beauty is left.",
