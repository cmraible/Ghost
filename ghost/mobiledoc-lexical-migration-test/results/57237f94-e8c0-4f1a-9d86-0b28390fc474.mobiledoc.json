The wing car in question auctioned at Mecum’s Kissimmee 2023 event for a whopping $1,300,000. When you add fees, the total comes out to $1,430,000, which appears to have set a new record for the ’69 Dodge Charger Daytona by a relatively narrow margin of $110,000."

In fact, Mecum went so far as to describe it as perhaps “the halo example of the entire breed.” That’s quite the statement, but Mecum claims it’s the lowest-mile, original-engine, 4-speed Hemi Dayton documented in existence."

We just want to know who has the self-discipline (or is it self-hatred?) to not drive this Hemi-powered Daytona more than that? The answer is a number of people, as this car has passed from one owner to another several times."

It has a nice list of features like power steering, power brakes, bucket seats, center console, ball-knob Hurst shifter, sports dash with Tic-Toc-Tach, AM radio, and remote driver’s mirror."
