Originally set to debut at the SEMA Show to much fanfare, Dodge blamed the setback on supply chain shortages without directly saying so. Well, surprise, surprise, that’s apparently not entirely true, something I’ve come to expect from Dodge in the past couple years or so. Instead, the real reason of exploding Hemi engines is so metaphorical for what’s going on with Dodge right now it's sad and pathetic."

Things were okay for a while, what with Dodge coming out with ever more interesting and insane versions of the Challenger and Charger. However, in there was the seed of destruction."

          "You see, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne had become convinced the company he helmed wasn’t big enough for what was coming. The man knew the electrification push would be mandated and expensive, so he wanted to merge with another colossal automaker to create a larger monstrosity, leveraging economies of scale. Comically, he made public overtures to several other automakers, including GM and Volkswagen Group, getting shot down like a star crossed teenager asking his crush to prom in front of the entire student body."

One of the first orders of business in the French-Italian-American conglomeration was to disband the SRT Division. That was no coincidence. With the need to pour resources into electrification, there was no time to fool around, wasting resources on making V8 cars more insanely powerful."

That’s why we’re getting these “Last Call” models. Honestly, most have been pathetic aesthetic packages, and now I think I know why that is."

But with resources diverted to that ridiculous “electric muscle car” we saw drive at 5 mph or under while making some sickly growling noise, we only get one moonshot model. And that one is having all kinds of problems. This isn’t because of supply chain issues, it’s because Stellantis has drained talent away from Dodge muscle cars, directing it to EV development."

I hate to say it, but the exploding engine problem in the final Dodge special edition Challenger/Charger doesn’t bode well for the future. Hope everyone enjoys their compact electric crossovers designed by Pierre Delecto."
