The Plymouth had been parked in the church's parking lot secured to a trailer and attached to a hand railing using a large chain. At around 7 a.m. on May 22nd, two men hooked up a dark blue or black Chevrolet Silverado to the trailer and then proceeded to pull the car until the chain and railing broke. The incident was caught on a security camera, and it gives a decent look at the truck as well as the two individuals who stole the car."
