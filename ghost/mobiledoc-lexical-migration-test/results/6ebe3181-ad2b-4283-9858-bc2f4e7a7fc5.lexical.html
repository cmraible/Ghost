<p>Since its inception in 1904, Rolls-Royce had earned a reputation for producing vehicles of unparalleled quality and dependability. The Silver Ghost, also known as the 40/50 hp, had already proven its mettle in earlier trials such as the Scottish Reliability Trials in 1907 and the London to Edinburgh Top Gear Trial in 1911. These triumphs had firmly established Rolls-Royce as the preeminent British car manufacturer, but for Claude Johnson, the ambitious managing director, conquering the European market was the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Johnson recognized that a victory in a prominent continental event would be the key to achieving this ambition. The Alpine Trial of 1913 presented an unmissable opportunity. With meticulous planning, Johnson handpicked a Rolls-Royce Works Team led by manager Eric Platford, and consisting of experienced drivers Curt Friese, Jock Sinclair, and EW Hives, along with privateer James Radley as the team's pacesetter.</p>
<p>The Silver Ghosts underwent extensive preparations to withstand the challenging conditions of the springtime Alps. The modifications included a new four-speed gearbox with a special low gear, reinforced chassis and suspension, larger fuel tanks, and an improved starting system designed to endure freezing temperatures. The cars proved their mettle during a successful reconnaissance mission in May, overcoming adverse conditions with remarkable composure.</p>
<p>On June 22, 1913, the Alpine Trial commenced in Vienna, Austria. The Silver Ghosts, recognized as the most powerful vehicles in the competition, led the pack, led by James Radley. The team's exceptional performance was evident from the very beginning, with Radley crossing the finish line of the first day's 260-mile stage in just over eight hours. The Silver Ghosts continued their dominance, excelling on challenging routes, including the Tauren Pass with its steep gradients and inclement weather.</p>
<p>As the days progressed, the Rolls-Royce Works Team maintained its unassailable lead, demonstrating the Silver Ghosts' unrivaled speed, strength, and reliability. Despite the treacherous Dolomites and freezing conditions, the team conquered every stage with confidence. The event's grand finale, the notorious Stubalpe Pass, posed no trouble for the Silver Ghosts. Only one setback occurred when Jock Sinclair's car was struck by a non-competitor's vehicle, forcing him to limp into Vienna with a damaged wheel.</p>
<p>Of the 46 vehicles that began the Alpine Trial, only 31 reached Vienna, with the Rolls-Royce cars standing out as the unequivocal champions. The team's outstanding performance garnered universal acclaim, solidifying the Silver Ghost's reputation as the world's finest automobile. The success translated into remarkable European sales growth, matching the brand's stature in the UK.</p>
<p>While the Alpine Trials continued until 1973, Rolls-Royce never again participated with a Works Team. The title of "the best car in the world</p>
