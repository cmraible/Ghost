With dangerous switchbacks and steep drop-offs, combined with incredibly thin air near the finish line, the competition has been plagued with unfortunate accidents in the past. Organizers have taken extraordinary steps to prevent serious accidents, even banning motorcycles from competition and taking other precautionary measures."
