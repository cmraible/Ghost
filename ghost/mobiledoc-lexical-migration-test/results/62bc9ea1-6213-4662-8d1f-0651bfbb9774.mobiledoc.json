After all, your buddies can get a Shelby GT500, 1955 Thunderbird, or whatever impressive vehicle in your collection but they can’t match living at 140 Edison Street in Detroit. The famous residence was just listed on the real estate market for a healthy $975,000."

You get to do all that while enjoying the amazing Italian Renaissance Revival-style architecture spread over 7,200 square feet for the main residence and another 1,100 square feet for the carriage house."

As the home listing makes clear, the current owners are fourth in a line of stewards, a position you would occupy once all the paperwork is signed. Considering the current owners are historians, archivists, and Wayne State University professors, you would need to learn a thing or two if you’re not already in that space."

Rich hardwood floors, double French doors, immaculate wallpaper, and the many details throughout you just don’t get on a modern house. If you’ve owned a pre-war car you know all that charm is great, but it does come with some catches. Whether you think it’s worth the true cost of ownership (which isn’t all dollars and cents) is a personal decision for sure."
