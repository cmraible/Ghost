The plugin also provides a feature to show how many times a particular post has been read inside existing post content. For example:</p>\n<p>The number of hits can be shown inside the post content, with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a custom phrase, e.g. “This post has already been read XX times!”</li>\n<li>a custom position (above the post, below the post, both)</li>\n<li>a custom CSS style</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>So which should you use? In the end that&#8217;s up to you. I&#8217;d definitely recommend try each until you find one or two that fit your needs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
