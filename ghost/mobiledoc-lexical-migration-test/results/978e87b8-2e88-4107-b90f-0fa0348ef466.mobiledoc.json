          "Ever since the Chevrolet Corvette was introduced new for the 1953 model year, plenty of interesting stories have collected over the decades. When it came to the 1969 Corvette model line, production was delayed at GM due to a parts strike which gave the 1970 model a shortened production run. In fact, a total of 17,316 examples were built, but only 1,287 of them were actual LT1 cars. With that said, Crown Concepts is excited to offer the opportunity to own this rare numbers-matching "

Cloaked in Donnybrooke Green with a white top, the depth and glossy shine really display those flowing Stingray curves. Inside, a contrasting saddle interior comes features bucket seats. Considering its prestigious award history, chances this vintage Vette will steal the spotlight at any car show you enter. "
