This is not a contest of who has removed dust from the deepest crevices in their Porsche but rather a judged show that rewards a Porsche that has been lovingly maintained and presents itself well on the field. Our judges do not use Porsche Parade Concours score sheets but rather rank the cars according to certain attributes discussed prior to judging. For those who do not wish to have their cars judged, you may display in the model specific corrals or if the organizers see fit, on the judged field itself. There are no score sheets returned or protest committees. This is a casual gathering of Porsche enthusiasts focused on having fun rather than solely competition."
