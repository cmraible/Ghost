<h4 id="stuff-i-m-reading-"><strong>Stuff I’m reading:</strong></h4>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://discourseblog.com/barack-obama-book-review-a-promised-land/">No, We Couldn’t</a> (</strong>Discourse Blog) — <em>A must-read review of Barack Obama’s new book, and how Obama makes “abundantly clear that he viewed impediments to political change not as a barrier to be overcome but rather as limitations that were there for his own good.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://prospect.org/politics/establishment-strikes-back-aoc-versus-centrist-democrats/">The Establishment Strikes Back</a> (</strong>American Prospect) — <em>A fight over committee seats illustrates how the House Democratic caucus tries to crush progressives.</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/crime-shouldnt-pay-why-big-tech-executives">Crime Shouldn't Pay: Why Big Tech Executives Should Face Jail</a></strong>(Big) — <em>“What Facebook and Google are doing is crime, and it needs to be treated as such. Right now, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai believe that they have to fight a civil case, which means spending money on lawyers and being deposed by government officials. But they will keep their wealth, and of course, their freedom, because they are personally not at risk, so scheming to dominate more markets elsewhere is a perfectly reasonable activity to pursue even while their companies are on trial. Violating the law by taking someone else’s livelihood risks, at worst, a parking ticket. But if these men were facing the prospect of personal criminal liability, then the stakes would suddenly shift.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/">‘We Are Slowly Being Poisoned’</a></strong> (Los Angeles Times) — <em>“The air you breathe on airplanes comes directly from the jet engines. Known as bleed air, it is safe, unless there is a mechanical issue — a faulty seal, for instance. When that happens, heated jet engine oil can leak into the air supply, potentially releasing toxic gases into the plane. For decades, the airline industry and its regulators have known about these incidents — called fume events — and have maintained that they are rare and that the toxic chemical levels are too low to pose serious health risks.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://brandonmagner.substack.com/p/labor-lawyers-and-bidens-judges">Labor Lawyers and Biden's Judges</a></strong>(Labor Law Lite) — <em>A look at how Democratic politicians have refused to appoint more labor-affiliated lawyers to the bench.</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ohio-fossil-fuel_n_5fdb862cc5b6f24ae35e61ba">Ohio Quietly Passes A Bill That Could Bankrupt Churches Linked To Fossil Fuel Protests</a></strong> (Huffington Post) — <em>“Ohio lawmakers faced fierce blowback last winter over a bill that would escalate criminal charges on fossil fuel protesters and threaten religious organizations or nonprofits that support such demonstrations with crushing fines…For nearly a year, the bill sat dormant. But this week, on the state Legislature’s final day, House lawmakers quietly passed it.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/business/economy/unemployment-benefit-payback.html">Jobless Benefits Saved Them, Until States Wanted the Money Back</a></strong>(New York Times) — <em>“Unemployment payments that looked like a lifeline may now, for many, become their ruin. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program that covers gig workers, part-time hires, seasonal workers and others who do not qualify for traditional unemployment benefits, has kept millions afloat…But in carrying out the hastily conceived program, states have overpaid hundreds of thousands of workers — often because of administrative errors. Now states are asking for that money back.</em></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota-"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>America is facing mass starvation and increasing poverty — and a millionaire senator who enriched himself with special tax cuts is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/millionaire-republican-cites-deficit/">holding up</a> emergency survival checks to millions of people. And yet somehow, this has not been the central topic of political conversation this week, which tells us a lot.</p>
<p>It first and foremost tells us that a media owned by corporations and billionaires will never consistently focus on efforts to materially improve the lives of the 99 percent. It also tells us that we still have a lot of work to do to build up a media infrastructure that forces scandals like this into the conversation.</p>
<p>We tried to do that at <em>The Daily Poster</em> with our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/millionaire-republican-cites-deficit/">story on Sen. Ron Johnson,</a> but it’s going to require a lot more - which is why I spend a lot of my time trying to raise resources for this kind of accountability journalism (if you want to pitch in more, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gift">give a gift subscription here</a>!)</p>
<p>On social media this week, much of the conversation among progressives focused on trying to force House Democrats to stage a Medicare for All floor vote. It’s a good idea that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/heres-what-medicare-for-all-supporters/">I’ve supported from the very beginning</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll admit to having felt a bit discouraged by some of the vitriol and toxicity that has defined this latest Medicare for All push. There has been a self-serving tendency among some (but certainly not most or all!) to pretend that honest tactical disagreements between allies are proof of weakness and corruption. I don’t think that kind of bad-faith criticism helps the cause of trying to guarantee health care to everyone. If we’re being honest and not just succumbing to virtue signaling or posturing, we should all admit that we pretty much know who the allies and opponents are in this battle. We should unrelentingly pressure everyone, but vilifying allies with personal invective probably does not help the cause.</p>
<p>That said, I’m way more encouraged than discouraged.</p>
<p>The #ForceTheVote initiative is important - and should be part of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/heres-what-medicare-for-all-supporters/">larger package</a> of Medicare for All demands. I am encouraged because the whole thing reminds me of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/health/policy/25memo.html">grassroots campaign</a> that many of us were part of a dozen years ago — the one trying to force Democrats to hold a Senate floor vote on a public health insurance option. We made a lot of enemies back then, but it was a worthwhile battle, just as today’s push for a vote is now.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago, it felt lonely to try to exert this kind of pressure — but now after so many people have been working so hard on the health care issue, there are a lot more people involved, and that is a very good sign.</p>
<p>It is easy to feel demoralized at a moment like this - the economy is in shambles, the political machine still seems all too resistant to change, the media ecosystem seems intent on spreading misinformation and social media seems like a weapon for demagogues to sow division rather than solidarity.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I’d be lying if I pretended that there were never times that I felt like quitting this work. But I know none of us can simply give up. The crises our communities, our country and our world face are simply too huge for us to just surrender. It’s a cliche to say, but it’s true: in the work we are all doing, failure is not an option.</p>
<p>As a subscriber to <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you are helping us do the work of accountability journalism that aims to change the media and make a real impact on politics and policy. We couldn’t do it without you, so I want to say once again: Thank you for that. And thank you for all the work you are doing in your own lives to try to make this a better world. The work is not in vain.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
