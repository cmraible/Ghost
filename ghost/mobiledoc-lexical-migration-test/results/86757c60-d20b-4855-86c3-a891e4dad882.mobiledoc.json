It has gutted the Voting Rights Act and public sector unions, entrenched unconstitutional abortion bans, and failed to overturn the discriminatory Muslim Ban. As a co-equal governing body, Congress cannot sit by while this attack on the constitution continues unchecked. The urgent work to restore American democracy must include expanding the Supreme Court.”"

ISO New England, which manages the power grid in six Northeast states, announced its intent to cancel the contract in November, citing project delays. First proposed in 2016, the power plant would have increased the available supply of electricity generated from gas in New England at a time when the region is facing fuel supply issues, according to developer NTE Energy LLC. But critics — including some state officials in Connecticut — have called the project counterproductive to efforts in the Constitution State and New England at large to transition to carbon-free electricity.”"
