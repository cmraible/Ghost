It came onto my radar because of the automotive connection and yaah, I get it, C8 Corvettes are cool and all, but the lyrics sound like something Michael Scott wrote in Prison Mike persona to try gaining street cred. If that’s not bad enough, the intro sequence in the video, before the ear-assaulting music starts, is so cringey I bet most people die of laughter if they don’t just click off the video immediately. Because I’m a professional and all I kept watching."
