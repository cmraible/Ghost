<hr>
<p>Decades before Cadillac debuted the Chevrolet-based Cimarron, Canadian textile magnate Reuben Allender tried his hand at building a downsized, lower-cost Cadillac. Based on the iconic 1956 and 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, these unusual hybrids were dubbed "<a href="https://www.mecum.com/auctions/kissimmee-2021/collections/el-morocco-collection/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">El Morocco</a>."</p>

The result is unique, yet oddly familiar – and altogether quite handsome. In some ways, it reminds us of the cars from Grand Theft Auto, which resemble an amalgamation of multiple real-world models.</p>
<p>This isn't a video game, though – this is as real as it gets. It's thought that only around 20 <a href="https://www.mecum.com/auctions/kissimmee-2021/collections/el-morocco-collection/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">El Moroccos</a> were built in 1956 and 1957. While the cars were priced below a Cadillac, they were, apparently, too expensive for your average Chevrolet buyer to seriously consider.</p>

<p>We'll hazard a guess that you've never seen one before, let alone three, as we have here. These cars belonged to car collector Marv Siesel, and now they're <a href="https://www.mecum.com/auctions/kissimmee-2021/collections/el-morocco-collection/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">heading to auction</a>.</p>
<p>There's a 1956 and two 1957s offered in the auction. The 1956 is a convertible, while the 1957s are represented by a coupe and a hardtop. All three are <a href="https://www.mecum.com/auctions/kissimmee-2021/collections/el-morocco-collection/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">restored to stunning condition</a>, just as they were in the 1950s.</p>
