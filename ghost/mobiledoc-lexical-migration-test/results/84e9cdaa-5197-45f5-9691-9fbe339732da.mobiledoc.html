<p>In its 27-years of operation, the Georgia <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/winacunninghamC8corvette?promo=C1">Lottery has been an incredibly beneficial</a> program that has not only paid out an <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/winacunninghamC8corvette?promo=C1">unbelievable amount of money in prizes</a> but has also raised $22.7 billion to benefit Georgia students. Because a large portion of the program's revenue comes from scratchers, there are a multitude of games going on at any given time.</p>
<p>One scratch-to-win game with a very gearhead-enticing jackpot is the $5.00 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-making-of-the-c8/">Corvette</a> and Cash Scratcher. For $5.00 players have the chance to win a 2021 C8 Corvette with a value of up to $107,000 and a $250,000 cash prize. But what are the odds of anyone winning the fastest base model Corvette to date and all of the cash needed to make it the fastest Corvette in the world? According to <a href="https://www.galottery.com/en-us/games/scratchers/active-games.html">galottery.com</a>, exactly 1.56M:1. Although winning was a long shot, Georgia Lotto player Dennis Kahler was feeling lucky enough to give it a shot and he won a 2021 Corvette and $250,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Not so fast though, did he forget that we are in the middle of a pandemic? Did he not know that there was a 40-day United Auto Workers strike that delayed production of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-questionable-trim/">the new American supercar</a>? Well he does now and unfortunately he had to find it out the hard way as all of these uncontrollable issues have come together in a whirlwind of trouble to ruin his good luck.</p>
<p>As it turns out the Georgia Lottery did not have a 2021 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-in-slicks-race-other-cars/">Corvette set aside</a> for the winner and they haven’t had any luck finding one. At this point, it appears that Mr. Kahler will be waiting until at least the third quarter of this year to claim his winnings. He has gotten his lawyers involved, but that is not likely to help speed things up here and he’s probably going to find out the hard way that patience is a virtue.</p>
