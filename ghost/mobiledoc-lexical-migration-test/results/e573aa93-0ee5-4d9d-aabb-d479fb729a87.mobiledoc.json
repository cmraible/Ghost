Built into the museum’s KidZone, \"When The Earth Shakes\" is a science-heavy exhibit that explores the causes of earthquakes and their consequences on the world around us. It features eight different interactive exhibits ranging from Quake Karaoke, where kids jump on a platform to see how their force equates to measurements of historic seismograph readings, to a Shake Table where the children can design buildings and see if they would survive and earthquake.  There is even a display that shows the planet’s tectonic plate movements from the time of the Pangea supercontinent and it continues plate movement for 200 million years into the future."
