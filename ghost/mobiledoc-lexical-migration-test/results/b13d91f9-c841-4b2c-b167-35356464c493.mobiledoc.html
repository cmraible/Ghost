<p>Last month, President Joe Biden nominated former Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), to serve as  ambassador to the Vatican. As the <em>Indianapolis Star</em><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/09/joe-donnelly-former-indiana-senator-nominated-vatican-ambassador/6069359001/">noted at the time</a>, the nomination of Donnelly made sense because “Faith has been a central theme for both Biden and Donnelly.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, during the 2020 presidential campaign, Donnelly, who is Catholic, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2020/08/16/joe-donnelly-joe-biden-man-faith-donald-trump-man-falsehood/3374930001/">wrote an op-ed</a> praising Biden’s faith, noting, “Pope Francis has said, ‘We must restore hope to young people, help the old, be open to the future, and spread love.’ Joe Biden exemplifies that message each day as he works to lead America back to its place as the moral compass for our world and an example for other nations to follow.”</p>
<p>Donnelly’s nomination is notable for another reason: He is a textbook example of one of Washington’s greatest scams, the “shadow lobbying” loophole.</p>

<p>“The modern individual has been made through centuries of disconnection — from the world around us, from others, and even from our own bodies. While wellness trends can help us to reconnect on some level, they incorrectly focus on the power of an individual to improve their own health whilst ignoring — or worse, defusing — another power: our ability to collectively dismantle the hierarchies that cause these disconnections and consequently a large share of the illnesses that we face.” — Rupa Marya and Raj Patel in <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374602529/inflamed"><em>Inflamed: Deep Medicine and the Anatomy of Injustice</em></a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>A new financial disclosure by former Sen. Joe Donnelly, Biden’s nominee for ambassador to the Vatican, sheds light on one of Washington’s greatest scams: the “shadow lobbying” loophole.</p>
<p>Federal ethics rules require former senators like Donnelly to undergo a two-year “cooling off” period before lobbying their old colleagues. To get around that restriction, senators often join big lobbying firms and start advising clients without making any direct contacts that would require them to register as lobbyists.</p>
<p>After losing reelection in 2018, Donnelly quickly joined the lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. His new Biden administration financial disclosure shows that since then, he’s made $872,000 as a partner at Akin Gump, where he has been advising corporate giants like Amazon, Salesforce, and Anheuser Busch.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>But the most fascinating name in Donnelly’s client list is hedge fund Elliott Management. The firm is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/paul-singer-doomsday-investor#:~:text=Singer%20had%20stress%2Dtested%20his,about%20a%20hundred%20million%20dollars.">best known</a> for buying up countries’ distressed debt for pennies on the dollar and demanding the debt be repaid in full. Elliott <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/03/29/how-one-hedge-fund-made-2-billion-from-argentinas-economic-collapse/">made $2.4 billion</a> from its 15-year debt crusade against Argentina — the home country of Pope Francis, who has criticized “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-capitalism/pope-criticizes-savage-capitalism-on-visit-to-food-kitchen-idUSBRE94K12K20130521">savage capitalism</a>.”</p>
<p>Elliott’s leadership also had a hand in Donnelly’s 2018 election loss. The firm’s billionaire founder Paul Singer <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/donor_detail.php?cycle=2018&id=U0000000066&type=I&super=N&name=Singer%2C+Paul+E.">donated</a> $2 million to the Senate Leadership Fund during the 2018 election cycle, when the super PAC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/senate-leadership-fund/C00571703/independent-expenditures/2018">bankrolled</a> $15 million worth of attacks against Donnelly and spent another $2 million to boost his GOP opponent. In his recent disclosure, Donnelly wrote that his work for Elliott has involved “explaining the potential legislative agenda before Congress.”</p>
<h3 id="bonus-scoop">BONUS SCOOP:</h3>
<p>The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF), the anti-Medicare for All front group run by lobbyists for health insurers, drug companies, and hospitals, reported spending nearly $36 million on a “public education” campaign in 2020, according to a new tax return obtained by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>
<p>We already knew PAHCF <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/25/biden-health-care-left-207639">spent millions</a> on TV ads attacking Medicare for All during the Democratic presidential primary campaign, but it appears the propaganda campaign went much further. Their tax return says they spent that money on grants to other nonprofits and “digital and print advertising, social media, and direct mail to educate the American public.”</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>On Sept. 8, 2020, President Joe Biden scoffed at then-President Donald Trump changing his tune on offshore drilling near Florida as Election Day neared. “You don’t have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling,” Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1303423093176774657">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>Now, coming off the heels of this year’s United Nations COP26 climate conference, the Biden administration is <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/after-cop26-biden-administration-to-auction-off-gulf-mexico-for-offshore-drilli/">poised to</a> auction off over 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling companies — the <a href="https://twitter.com/dallasgoldtooth/status/1460973992563687428?t=CzkSP8uyEXjk0f_8Jk4drg&s=19">largest land auction for fossil fuels</a> in U.S. history.</p>

In nominating Gerber, an investment executive with deep ties to fossil fuels, Biden may have squandered his last opportunity to fill an FRITB slot with someone serious about pushing the board to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-is-ignoring-an-easy-climate-victory/">divest the TSP from fossil fuels</a>, a no-brainer in addressing climate change.</li>

    <li><strong>KEY BBB HEALTH POLICIES WOULD ONLY KICK IN AFTER MIDTERMS: </strong>Some of the most popular health care provisions in Democrats’ $1.75 trillion social spending bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/15/democrats-reconciliation-health-care-midterms-521959">wouldn’t take effect</a> until after the 2022 midterm elections, complicating prospects for vulnerable Democrats up for reelection. The policies with a delayed start date? Drugmaker penalties for hiking prices, a $35-per-month insulin cap, a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket pharmaceutical spending for seniors, and Medicare hearing aid coverage. Regarding the Medicare drug price negotiation proposal, “the lower prices Medicare will negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for some of the most expensive drugs won’t be available until 2025 — with a full phase-in coming in 2028,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/15/democrats-reconciliation-health-care-midterms-521959">according to</a><em>Politico</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>DSA CHAPTERS URGE REP. BOWMAN’S EXPULSION: </strong>Several local Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) chapters are <a href="https://twitter.com/DSAdenver/status/1460718260761079810?t=CpDIhuYuOLwdUL16cbsmFg&s=19">calling on</a> the organization to expel Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) from their membership. The chapters cite Rep. Bowman’s recent actions as running counter to a central goal of DSA’s platform: Palestine's liberation. “Within the last few months, Bowman <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021243">has voted in favor</a> of $3.3 billion in military aid to Israel and an additional $1 billion in funding for Israel’s already fully-funded Iron Dome,” noted DSA Denver’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIktcbFA7wllk3WfiZwT7pfIs5MDGAR8SesBXg_6Ag4/preview">statement</a> on the issue.</li>
    <li><strong>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IGNORES ANIMAL AG IN U.S. METHANE PLAN:</strong> Earlier this month, the Biden administration published <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-Methane-Emissions-Reduction-Action-Plan-1.pdf">its plan</a> to reduce domestic methane emissions. The plan outlines new limits on oil and gas plant emissions in the U.S., but fails to regulate animal agriculture — the biggest source of methane emissions in the country. “Instead, the Biden administration will rely on ‘incentive-based and voluntary’ efforts, predominantly encouraging livestock farms to install methane capture devices and digesters that collect and transform manure into burnable biogas,” according to <a href="https://www.foodandpower.net/latest/cop26-methane-ag-digesters-21"><em>Food & Power</em></a>.</li>
