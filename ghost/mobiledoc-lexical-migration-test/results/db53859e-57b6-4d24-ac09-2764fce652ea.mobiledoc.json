It showcases the classic body well, which features almost impossibly blemish-free sheet metal, plus all the badges and trim. Perfect glass all around, factory wheels, plus the spare tire with cover located in the cargo area makes for a nice, complete setup. You can also pop the top on this Blazer, so the backseat passengers enjoy the wind but the driver and front passenger are still covered."

A 350ci small block V8 provides plenty of horsepower and torque, while the factory four-wheel-drive systems works great, so whether you’re rolling over a boulder, powering through mud, or cruising on the highway, you never feel like this Chevy Blazer is truly struggling. The automatic transmission takes the struggle out of driving in heavy traffic or through the city."

With all the OE gauges and controls, plus the original steering wheel, it provides the same functionality as when it first roamed dirt trails. The headliner, carpeting, and door panels are also in excellent shape, while soft red cloth upholstery makes riding in this SUV a real treat."

Considering this second-generation Blazer comes with many of the classic features, particularly the removable top, and it has been lightly used, it will rightfully appreciate in value as time marches on.
