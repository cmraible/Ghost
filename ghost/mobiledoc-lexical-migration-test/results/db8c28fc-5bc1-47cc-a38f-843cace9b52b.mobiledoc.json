          "To criminals, such objects are just a quick score, a way to make money with minimal effort. However, for the family they carry immense sentimental value. Understandably, they want both back. While the local report doesn’t get too much into their backstory, it does say both were built by a man who was a construction worker. He obviously put a lot of time and effort into getting both Fords just right. The ’27 Model T coupe was apparently a tribute to his late wife. Now the gearhead father is also gone, so the two Fords are all his children and grandchildren had of him. That was until someone decided to help themselves."

While swiping someone’s Hyundai can cause plenty of suffering, it’s when these rare, sentimental rides are taken that it really hurts. Please keep your eyes peeled for these classic Fords and spread this story around so they’re returned, hopefully in one piece."
