<h3 id="these-are-among-the-most-smile-inducing-vehicles-out-there">These are among the most smile-inducing vehicles out there.</h3>
<p>Fun in the sun, beaches, surfing: these are just some of the activities which are commonly associated with a vehicle like this <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/vehicle-details/?show_vehicle=174947&tsauction_id=204&page=featured?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">Meyers Manx Dune Buggy</a>.

<p>Originally created by Bruce F. Meyers, an engineer, boat builder, and artist living in California, it didn’t take long for people to fall in love with the Meyers Manx. Being small, they’re high maneuverable and a blast to drive off the road. In some areas you can license them for road use, meaning Jeeps aren’t the only way to enjoy completely open freedom.</p>
<p>The absolutely beautiful purple body sparkles in the sunlight, which is a fun way to celebrate a playful vehicle. Polished knock-off wheels and a black bikini top pair well with it, while various engine components, the brush bar, and other trim pieces feature chrome.</p>
<p>What appear to be new or at least newer black seats should provide all the cushioning and support you would need. Simple gauges and controls keep the focus on getting out and having a good time.</p>
<p>Using the Volkswagen Beetle for the chassis and engine, this dune buggy should be quite reliable. That also means finding replacement parts isn’t a difficult or expensive prospect.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this Meyers Max is quite capable of taking you to all kinds of destinations off the road. Not only is it raised for good ground clearance, the small size allows it to fit where many other off-roaders can’t go. It’s a fun way to see areas you might not even catch a glimpse of otherwise, or to transport items like a surfboard for outdoor fun.</p>
