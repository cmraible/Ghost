No, all those zeroes aren’t a typo, it’s over two million dollars. For a lot of people, including those who are hardcore ‘Cuda fans, that might seem unbelievably steep."

You’ll note there are no hood pins, a curious thing to opt for with a Shaker. There’s also a stripe delete, tac delete, Premium trim, and overhead console. That’s an interesting combination of options."

That Alpine White paint is a respray, but the car is otherwise unrestored and so is in a sense a relic of the past. That, combined with its historic significance, explains why the dealership is asking so much for it."
