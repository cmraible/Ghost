The classic French car is rare, highly collectible, and something which probably won’t get the masses all worked up. But Talbot-Lago is known for having painstakingly crafted small batches of vehicles, making the brand legendary among the well-heeled collectors around the globe."

In other words, some people have been waiting a long, long time for one of these to hit the open market. And you can expect they’re bringing a treasure chest of funds along for the bidding process."

By today’s standards the 190-horsepower peak output is laughable, but back in post-war Europe that was quite extraordinary."

Considering its age and how many Talbot-Lagos have been through at least a degree or restoration at some point, that’s remarkable. For that and the other compelling factors around this vehicle, Bonhams is estimating the top bid will hover near $2 million."
