He's also happy to have gotten rides in some serious high-performance machines.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Little King Singh has been fighting leukemia since he was just two years old. He's grown up with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/aston-martin-victor/">an intense love for cars</a>, often playing with Hot Wheels cars in his hospital bed, according to his mother.</p>

<p>He celebrated his birthday on August 18th, and, after having his last treatment in October 2019, was able to celebrate 100% cancer free. He rang in his seventh birthday in a big way thanks to Josh Aryeh.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/30/7-year-old-queens-boy-gets-surprise-ride-to-celebrate-being-cancer-free/">New York Post</a>, Aryeh is the founder of <a href="https://www.smilesthroughcars.com/">Smiles Through Cars</a>, an organization that works with supercar owners to do good work for sick and underprivileged kinds in their communities. He met the Singh family two years ago.</p>

<p>The group provides car rides and toys for kids like Singh. Aryeh even dresses up like Batman when he gives kids <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-demon-vs-bmw-m5/">the ride of their life</a> in his Lamborghini Aventador SVJ. He also has a Nissan GT-R dressed up as the Batmobile.</p>
<p>Aryeh was overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing Singh cancer-free for the first time. In his words, “for a child not to have a childhood it’s just horrible for anybody to see.”</p>

<p>Singh even got to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/c8-corvette-exclusive-performance/">sit behind the wheel</a> of the Aventador and have his picture taken. Naturally, he had a big smile on his face. After his Lamborghini thrill ride, he simply told reporters “That was amazing!”</p>
<p> We're so happy that he had such an excellent birthday. A little warrior like him deserves it, and we're thankful that real-life superheroes exist to make it happen. Here's to many more amazing birthdays for Little King Singh.</p>
