<p>What could be better than buying a 750-horsepower <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">Ford Mustang GT500</a>? How about winning an 800-horsepower <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">Ford Mustang GT500 Signature Edition</a>? Well here’s your chance and the best part is that you can enter to win for as little as a $25 donation to Cruise for a Cause.</p>

<p>As a limited edition model, only 100 Ford Mustang GT500SEs will be built for each model year and only one of the 2021 examples will carry both a Shelby serial number and a Cruise for a Cause Hope Edition Serial number. That makes this Antimatter Blue <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">Shelby GT500 Signature</a> “HOPE” Edition a true one-of-one example but there is more to this car than just a rare name. It is equipped with nearly every optional package, including the Technology Package and the Carbon Fiber Track Package.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winashelbyamericangt500se?promo=SPEED20">Shelby American Signature Edition</a> treatment abides by the same school of the thought implemented in all Shelby vehicles. Reduce weight, improve handling, increase power. On top of the additional 40-horsepower gained with the addition of a Performance Supercharger pulley, a high volume supercharger intercooler, and a high volume supercharger heat exchanger, the Signature Edition also includes a re-calibrated suspension and a lightweight hood. Its slick black leather upholstery is finished with an embroidered Carrol Shelby signature and a CSM dash plate.</p>
