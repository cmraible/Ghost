That will largely dictate what kind of performance upswing there will be, but with a target of over 1,000-hp we don’t see how Stellantis could reasonable hit that without using a Hemi."

You’re certainly welcome to make up your own mind about what it all means, but we’ll all have to wait and see what comes down the line from Stellantis as time marches forward."
