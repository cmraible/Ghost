<p>Hunting down barn find cars is a dream of so many, but it’s a lot harder than it sounds. One of the best in the business is Dennis Collins, who had racked up some pretty impressive finds over the years. For a sampling, you should check out his YouTube channel. Anyway, this time around he’s shared a video of him rescuing a barn find 1959 Chevrolet Corvette in Georgia. And unlike so many “barn finds,” this car is grimy all over, so it doesn’t look staged.</p>

<p>While coming across any barn find C1 Corvette is certainly exciting, this one is even more special. Pictures sent over by the owner of the car show a fuel injection unit under the hood. If it’s factory-original, that can add a nice amount to the value of this ‘Vette.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the guy who owns this Corvette says his grandfather drove it into the barn where it resides 60 years ago. That sounds really far-fetched, because it would had to have been brand new or close to it at the time. And that’s the thing about hunting down barn find cars is that people will tell you overblown stories like that because they think it will make you more excited and pump up the value of the car. If you keep a level head like Collins does (he has a ton of experience) you won’t get duped by stories which don’t add up.</p>
<p>You’ll see in the video that this C1 Corvette is buried back in the property. There’s no way someone would know about it unless the family told them or they were a close friend who spent a lot of time there. This is why having connections by winning people’s confidence is essential if you want to track down a lot of barn find cars. Also, getting the car out of there is a bit of a challenge, but you’ll have to watch the video to see how they do it.</p>
