That’s exactly what happened to the driver of a new Land Rover Defender which rolled 6 times, all thanks to another driver not paying attention. Life comes at you fast and this is a horrific reminder of that."

The impact sends the Defender careening to the left, then the SUV rolls side to side 6 times, the second-to-last violent revolution catapulting the vehicle over the cement divider."
