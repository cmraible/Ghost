          "Driving a powerful high-performance sports car certainly is an exhilarating feeling. Unfortunately, for some people it’s so intoxicating they start doing really stupid things behind the wheel while on public roads. Hey, if you want to hot dog it on a track with nobody around, spinning out and flipping your Corvette, by all means go for it. But a guy in California did one worse, using his C8 Corvette like a bowling ball, flipping a truck onto its roof in the process of mangling his mid-engine sports car."

When they arrived, officers and other first responders found the C8 Corvette with extensive front-end damage in the same lane as a pickup truck which was flipped onto its roof."

          "The CHP investigation concluded that’s somewhat close to what really happened. They say the C8 Corvette was behind several other vehicles as it was traveling in the westbound lane when the driver decided to try passing three slower cars at once. He probably thought his ‘Vette was so fast he could do anything, but he was wrong. All vehicles have limits."

While the C8 Corvette driver only suffered minor injuries, the three people in the pickup were taken to the hospital with minor to moderate injuries. At least nobody was in critical condition, but as police concluded, the whole accident could’ve been avoided had the Chevy driver been more careful. He was cited for an “unsafe driving maneuver."
