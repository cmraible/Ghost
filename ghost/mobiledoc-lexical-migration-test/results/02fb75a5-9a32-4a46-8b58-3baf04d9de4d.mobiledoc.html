<p>This prize package consists of a <a href="https://tri-industries.tapkat.org/wintwinbmwcaferacers" rel="noopener">1982 BMW R100RS and 1988 BMW R100RT</a> that have been restored and customized by Johnny Nguyen of Anaheim's UpCycle Garage. They are engineered for form and function. While they look similar, Nguyen included some key differences so he could tell them apart, not the least of which is their complimentary green and silver paint jobs.</p>

<p>Both bikes are powered by BMW's famous 980cc boxer mills which now sports matching vintage-style valve covers and velocity stacks. They also each exhale via pie-cut stainless steel exhaust systems, but the 2-into-1 exhaust exits low on the right of the silver RS while the pipes converge into an Akrapovič slip-on muffler under the seat of the green RT. Nguyen has also updated the bikes with completely modern electronics, including app-controlled lighting and keyless start with the touch of a button. Their style is vintage, but their hardware is cutting edge.</p>
