<hr>
<p>You might liken it to selling your birthright for a pot of porridge, but cash-strapped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1994-mitsubishi-lancer-evolution-ii-gsr-lets-you-live-your-wrc-dreams/">Mitsubishi</a> UK is selling off a whole slate of classic cars in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-government-classic-car-buyers/">jolly old England</a>. The automaker’s loss could be your gain, especially if you like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">sitting on the “wrong” side of the car</a>. All joking aside, some of these classic Mitsubishi cars on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/covid19-industry-disruptor/">virtual auction block</a> right now are pretty cool, so we hope they <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-hunter-rescue-cars/">go to proper homes</a>.

<p>Many of you might be lusting after a classic Japanese sports car and you’re in luck. There’s a nice red 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT in the auction, which looks nearly perfect. If you want something a little more vintage, there’s a 1988 Mitsubishi Starion that recently underwent an engine overhaul and turbo rebuild, so it should purr like a kitten.</p>

<p>Also impressive is the 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX MR FQ-360 HKS, the swan song of that beloved platform. It’s 1 of just 200 made and has under 5,000 miles. However, if you’re looking for something with an actual racing history, there’s a 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX – Group N Works Rally Car listed. Piloted by Guy Wilkes and Phily Pugh, it snagged multiple podium finishes and even won the British Rally Championship for 2 years.</p>

<p>In case you forgot, and it’s easy considering, Mitsubishi used to make wonderful off-roaders. There are a few included n the auction, most notably a 1983 Mitsubishi Jeep J27 Soft Top. Originally a JDM-only product, you don’t see many of them in North America, so it would make crashing Jeep gatherings a real blast.</p>
<p>The auction for these cars end in under a month, so check them out <a href="https://www.autoauction.co.uk/?page=1">here</a> if you’re interested.</p>
