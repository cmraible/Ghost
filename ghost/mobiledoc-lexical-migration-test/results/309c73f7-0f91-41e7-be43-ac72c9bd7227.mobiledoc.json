Tetley corrects and gets all 4 tires back on the blacktop, but his front end veers toward the wall of hay bales on the other side as the back end breaks loose, spinning the car hard just as it enters the final turn. Yes, the man was so close to posting an impressive course time, which would have silenced critics instead of giving them this fodder – thus is life and racing."
