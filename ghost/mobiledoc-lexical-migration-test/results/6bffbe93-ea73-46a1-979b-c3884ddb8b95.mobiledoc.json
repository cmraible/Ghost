Working from home is an excellent way of concentrating on particualr tasks, getting copy edited and sent to the sub-editing desks and clearing e-mail.\n\nBut the social buzz of the office is still the best way of generating ideas. If we do, as a culture, shift towards a more mobile working paradigim, then our office spaces are going to have to develop to reflect their primarily social role.\n\n\n"
