He has another 8 Pontiacs in his collection, plus the man claims to have the largest collection of Pontiac literature in the world. He’s taken it upon himself to keep the memory of Pontiac going after GM snuffed out the brand."

With the Motor Bella outdoor auto show being held in September, he hopes soliciting donations there will get him a good portion of the way to the final amount."

With that kind of a vision, you might think the man is a Michigan native, but he actually lives in Oklahoma. He’s also not rich, having retired after working in a printing plant most of his adult life. Dye is just a big Pontiac nut and he knows locating the museum in Pontiac, Michigan is more than just a good gimmick."
