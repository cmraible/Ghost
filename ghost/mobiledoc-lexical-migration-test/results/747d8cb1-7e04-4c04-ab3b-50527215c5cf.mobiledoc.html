<p>Vintage motorcycles and a few modern rides are being sold off this weekend as part of the Robert Sedivy Collection. If you’re a fan of American motorcycles, whether modern or vintage, this is your opportunity to add some great options to your collection.</p>
<p><strong>See what a Harley-Davison semi looks like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/harley-rig-amazing/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>One of the highlighted bikes is a <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1941-Harley-Davidson-Knuckle-Head-EL/lotInformation/75268386">1941 Harley-Davidson Knucklehead EL</a>, a civilian bike which snuck through the production line before everything was converted for the war effort. Not only does it come high presentable with a nice two-tone paint job, black frame, and saddle bags, there’s a suicide shifter for that unique riding experience.</p>
