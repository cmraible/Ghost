Just keep in mind these two cruisers aren’t exactly lightweights, but the 1802cc Big Boxer with 107.1 mm bore and 100 mm stroke are pushing 91-horsepower and 116 lb.-ft. of torque. That’s not bad, but it’s not like Harley doesn’t offer something arguably comparable or even better – which of course is all a matter of opinion. Most importantly, many Harley faithful won’t be swayed by that alone, especially not after the Milwaukee-Eight was unveiled last year. A constant-mesh 6-speed transmission with a single-plate dry clutch helps put that power to the road in these new R 18s."

DCC means the bike will use engine braking to keep speed at a constant, even when you’re going downhill. In especially steep terrain, like in a mountain pass, the system will even engage the ABS brakes, although there’s no mention of how the risk of vapor lock would be avoided. With ACC, the bike maintains a preset following distance with vehicles ahead, using radar sensors just like you find in many cars today. Will this kind of technological wizardry appeal to people considering Harleys? Will it get those who otherwise are nervous about traveling on two wheels in the saddle? We’ll see."

To add even more comfort into the mix, there’s a Marshall sound system and a heated seat, which oddly sounds nice, although heated handlebar grips would also be great.
