<h3 id="all-of-these-hammer-prices-were-donated-to-charities-and-barrett-jackson-waived-its-fees-and-commissions">All of these hammer prices were donated to charities, and Barrett-Jackson waived its fees and commissions.</h3>
<p>Charity auctions are a great way to raise some serious money for important causes, and the bright lights and big crowds at Barrett-Jackson's Scottsdale <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/highlights/">auction</a> always bring impressive donation vehicles. This year, nine amazing vehicles cross the auction block to benefit charities both nationwide and local to Arizona, and the vehicles are as diverse as the charities with everything from a Jeff Gordon racecar to the two first-production <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/modern-too-damn-fat/">modern cars</a> and a handful of custom classics. In the end, these nine cars ended up raising a total of $7.575 million!</p>
