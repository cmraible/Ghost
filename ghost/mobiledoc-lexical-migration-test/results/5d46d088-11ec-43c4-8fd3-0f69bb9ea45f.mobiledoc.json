While Vision News says this move is to keep residents in their own neighborhood instead of driving freely, Oxfordshire News highlighted a rebuttal from an unnamed member of the county council."

If that isn’t bad enough, to qualify a driver will need to register their vehicle with the council and allow it to be tracked through the extensive surveillance cameras already in place everywhere. If a residence has more than one car, their journeys will be counted together. That seems like a particularly raw deal if you have roommates, but then again this whole thing stinks."
