Of course, this deal is a little too much for most with a price tag of $12 million, but Pippen is definitely a motivated seller.",

They are a Porsche 911 GT3 RS, Mercedes G63 AMG, and Ferrari 488 Pista. All three are from the 2020 model year, so she’s obviously not that attached to them. With how much the Pippens are worth, it shouldn’t be a shock they’re easily parting with vehicles most of us only dream of driving, let alone owning. Those three cars are claimed to be worth $1.5 million, but we’d advise checking current market values before finalizing an offer.",
