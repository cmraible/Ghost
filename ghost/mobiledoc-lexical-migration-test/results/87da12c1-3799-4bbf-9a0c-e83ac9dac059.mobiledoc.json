At the heart of this beast is the 5.7-liter LT-1 V8 rated at 260 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, while mag wheels, monochromatic paint and unique design elements (such as the grille and rear quarter windows) made the Impala SS instantly recognizable."

In a similar fashion as the Impala, the Marauder started life as a Mercury Grand Marquis, and it was given a stiffer suspension and unique styling elements – some of which were borrowed from the Ford Crown Victoria – including five-spoke chrome wheels, smoked headlights and a distinctive front bumper with integrated fog lights. Under the hood is a 4.6-liter DOHC V8 rated at 302 horsepower."
