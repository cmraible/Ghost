For those familiar with the game series, you will remember that it follows the stories and intertwined lives of the variety of customers who visit your cafe from fantasy races such as elves, satyrs and werewolves, to just your average joe looking for his coffee hit, with each character you meet having unique dreams, stories and personalities. For this sequel, the lives of the people who visit your cafe have become more developed and intriguing and that brings with it a bigger pool of customers to interact with. In addition, the continuing storylines from the first game are well followed and it’s nice to see familiar faces return and even better to find out more about the lives of the characters I was so invested in."

The sequel carries on the experience of serving your customers drinks, which not only improves your relationships with them but can slightly impact the stories you’re privy to. This still remains just as interesting and challenging as it was the first time around and it’s nice to see that even though the mechanics are the same, they don’t feel tired despite areas being just as frustrating as they were last time. If you do just want to chill out and serve drinks, you can always go and play endless mode which can be played on either ‘Free Brew’ or ‘Challenge Mode’. This mode is incredibly handy because it allows you to play and fail multiple times and is the best place to practice trying to find the right combinations."
