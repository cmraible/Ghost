Trump. Mr. Biden will reinstate and slightly expand the original 1.3 million acre boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument, and restore the original 1.8 million acre boundaries of Grand Staircase-Escalante, two rugged and pristine expanses in Utah that are defined by red rock canyons, rich wildlife, and archaeological treasures.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

The 2022 midterms aren’t even here yet, never mind the 2024 election. And Arizona’s primaries are open to independent voters ― meaning the exact makeup of the electorate is hard to nail down even in the weeks leading up to an election, let alone three years in advance. But the numbers for Sinema, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-biden-reconciliation_n_61548b6ae4b075408bd1e9fc?2sl"><em>a centrist who is playing a starring role in holding up key parts of President Joe Biden’s agenda</em></a>, are grim. They show widespread discontent with her performance, making her vulnerable to nearly any Democratic challenger.”</em></p>

Workers informed Voodoo Doughnut of the strike, which lasted for two days, during Oregon’s record breaking heat wave where temperatures rose to, or above, 115 degrees. The goal of the strike was to protect workers, while simultaneously encouraging the company to address the growing concern around these dangerous working conditions. As each striking worker returned following the heat wave, they were terminated on the bogus accusation of workplace abandonment.”</em></p>
