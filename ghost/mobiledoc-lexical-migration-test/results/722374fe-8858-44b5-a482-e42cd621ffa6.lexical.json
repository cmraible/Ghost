The first issue was when the entrepreneur purchased a 1967 Maserati Ghibli in 2010 for a mere $16,000. It sounds like the classic Italian car needed extensive restoration work, what with the shop quoting an estimate of at the most $200,000. That and the time frame to finish the job of only 2 years were both inaccurate as the project extended on for 4 years, cost over $1,000,000 and the restoration still wasn’t complete.",
