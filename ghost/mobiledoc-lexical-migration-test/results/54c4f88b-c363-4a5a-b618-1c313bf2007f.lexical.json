Originally this 10,000 project was said to hold a bowling alley, a casino, a bar, and many other personal luxuries. But, of course, it isn't uncommon for people to want to live it up a little bit when they get some money, and there really is nothing wrong with the idea. The only catch was that the homeowner never cleared the construction project with the city, and as such, a legal battle ensued. Eventually, the court gave him until March 10, 2022, to tear the extension off of his house, and, needless to say, he is royally pissed.",
