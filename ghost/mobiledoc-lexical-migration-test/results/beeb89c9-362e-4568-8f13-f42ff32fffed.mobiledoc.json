Others have seized such fire-breathing Dodges, converting them into fleet vehicles for running down criminals. Then there’s Dearborn Heights Police which decided to auction off the Dodge Charger Hellcat it seized, we’re assuming to keep the fleet gassed up so they can actually respond to 911 calls."

Sure, you can’t outrun a Motorola, but sometimes stop sticks don’t stop a pursuit and some departments have had their funding cut so much they don’t have enough officers to go all-in on getting in front of a fleeing suspect. For whatever set of reasons, they believe a Hellcat or a few in the fleet is the solution."

Considering how expensive cars are these days and how much people are selling Hellcats for on the used market, it sounds like it was likely a good deal. In the meantime, the department hasn’t figured out what it will do with the extra cash. It might need to save that for gas money with the way things are going."
