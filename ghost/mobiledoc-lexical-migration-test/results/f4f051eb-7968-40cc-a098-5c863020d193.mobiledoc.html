<p>It may not be much to go off of, but a French Wholesaler known as WTT.biz has listed Witcher 3 for the Nintendo Switch on their website. When we typed “Witcher 3” into the search section on the website, this came up…</p>

<p>I told you it wasn’t much to go off of… but nonetheless, this could be a thing! Granted, there are some glaring omissions, most notably being no thumbnail image but it certainly raises a few eyebrows.</p>
<p>Witcher 3 is quite a graphically intensive game, requiring some decent hardware specs, so it’d be interesting to see how a Switch port would perform.</p>
