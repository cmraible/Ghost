That’s exactly the situation a Kansas man is facing with a 1979 Chevy Corvette chassis officials from Douglas County, Kansas claim is valued at $12,100. Don Hawley, the owner of the parts car, says he bought it for a mere $1,000 and believes that’s what it’s worth, considering it has no drivetrain, interior, and plenty of other parts."
