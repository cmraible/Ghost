While the engine bay isn’t quite to show quality, the block is painted a cool blue while the Edelbrock air cleaner is an interesting shade of purple. A slick 3-speed automatic transmission means nobody is excluded from driving this pony."

While that’s not much for a 2017 car, it’s even more phenomenal for something from 1970. The fiery red paint job almost smolders in the light, adding plenty of personality to a ride everyone recognizes. For good measure, this car wears a hood scoop and chin spoiler"

The quarter panel scoops were removed from the car, plus the rear taillights were sunk into their housings instead of protruding outward. High-back bucket front seats became standard for the lineup.
