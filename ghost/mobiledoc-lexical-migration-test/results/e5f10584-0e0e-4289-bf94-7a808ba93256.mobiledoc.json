This started with the removal of the factory V12 and replacing it with the engine from another 365 GTB/4 Daytona – the car driven by Dan Gurney and Brock Yates in the first-ever Cannonball Run – and modified with high-compression pistons, dry-sump lubrication and specialized tuning to the engine's timing and carburetion. In modified form, this engine laid down 450 horsepower making it the only privateer version of this car to offer that much power, and the Ferrari was further modified with an aluminum radiator, wider wheels and upgraded brakes pulled from a Mk IV Ford GT40 (12-inch rotors with four-piston calipers)."
