It’s always sad to see this kind of tragedy, especially considering it was likely avoidable. And while we might poke some fun at Corvette owners, the C7Z is an amazing performance vehicle, so seeing one go up in flames is heart wrenching for sure."

As fires usually do, the smoke increased rapidly, so the guy pulled over but waited until after Turn 5. By that point he said he was having trouble breathing thanks to all the smoke."

The C7Z owner says he yelled at the wrecker driver to “pull back” since he realized his beloved sports car was a goner and “didn’t want anyone getting hurt.” At least he knows people are more valuable than vehicles. Also, we’re guessing he was carrying good track insurance."

What we can’t believe is anyone takes their car on the track without even a small fire extinguisher attached inside. Fires happen, especially when you’re really pushing a car, and even a little fire suppression can go a long way if you catch the problem early enough."
