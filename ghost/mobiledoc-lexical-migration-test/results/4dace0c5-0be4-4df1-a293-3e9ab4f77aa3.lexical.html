<p>Use the <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">code WIN</a> and get your hands on one of the hottest cars in the world. Chevrolet maxed out the performance capabilities of the front-engine rear-wheel-drive platform with the previous generation Corvette ZR1 leading the auto manufacturer to completely re-imagine the car for it’s 8th-generation. This all new design features a mid-engine layout, taking America’s Sports Car closer to super car status than it ever has been. In addition to the new engine position, enhanced aerodynamics, and optimal weight distribution, the interior <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">design of the Corvette</a> has never been so luxurious and driver oriented. Unfortunately, a lag in production has made getting your hands on one even harder than ever. However, thanks to Ronald McDonald House Central Valley enthusiasts still have the opportunity to win one.</p>
