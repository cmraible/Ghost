You control a protagonist, who very much looks like Doomguy, and you run around trying to evade the worm onslaught for as long as possible. You’re armed with two weapons, both of which are permanently equipped with one in each hand. The right hand gun is the standard rifle and the left is more of a cannon that fires three shots at once, but at a much slower rate than the rifle."

The worm creatures slowly start to spawn and attack you – I tried my age-old tactic in these kinds of games of running around in circles around the perimeter while an orderly queue of enemies starts chasing you because hey, as long as they’re behind you you’re safe right? Wrong. The AI in this game is ingenious and the worms (despite being invertebrates) are clever, or at least cleverer than I was. They cut you off and jump at you from all sorts of angles which means running around in circles and blindly firing will not serve you very well. You have to engage in combat and take these mothers down. Cocoons holding power-ups and extra health pickups sporadically appear however they are few and far between which makes this game tricky!"
