            "text": "General Motors struck gold with the Chevelle nameplate. The model was available in four different body styles, powered by a slew of engine options, spread over the span of three different generations during one of the most iconic eras in automotive history. As such, it is not all that surprising that the 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle was considered to be America’s most popular mid-size car. This spike in popularity led to production numbers of over 500,000 vehicles in 1969 alone, a majority of which were powered by a V8 engine. However, one of the most coveted options was the 396-cid powered SS Coupe of which over 60,000 were produced. Despite relatively large production numbers, it can be hard to find a well preserved example that hasn’t been tinkered with.",
