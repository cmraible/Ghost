Previously, the record stood at a lofty $900,000 but it was blown away by the recent sale of a very clean example, which at the hammer sold for a whopping $1.3 million. This goes to show that classic American muscle cars still command big bucks in the collector world. "

          "The old saying was “win on Sunday, sell on Monday” but the Dodge Charger Daytona didn’t exactly wow people looking for a cool ride to cruise up and down Main Street. With the huge rear wing and crazy nose cone, many found the muscle modified for high-speed tracks to be clownish, performance be damned. That attitude hasn’t aged well at all, because these days the Dayton and its Plymouth sibling, the Superbird, obviously command high prices at auctions. "

But that’s not all, because this thing is loaded with all kinds of bells and whistles like the C6G Green vinyl bucket seats, N51 Max Cooling Package, remote left-hand mirror, A01 Light Package, C16 woodgrain center console, power steering, and so much more. In fact, it’s the most highly optioned Hemi Daytona on the books. Now you have a better idea of why it’s estimated to go for so much."
