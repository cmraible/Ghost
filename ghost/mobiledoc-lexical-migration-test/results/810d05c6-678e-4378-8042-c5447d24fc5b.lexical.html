<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-high-end-chop-shop/">Police in Perthshire, UK</a> are looking for the other driver <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-hit-and-run/">in a hit and run</a> which left the man behind the wheel of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-model-a-honda-s2000/">Ford Model A</a> with serious injuries to his arm. It’s the sort of thing nobody wants to be the victim of, especially <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1956-plymouth-belvedere-wrecked/">when driving a restored classic car</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>See the results of a 1956 Plymouth Belvedere involved in a hit and run <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1956-plymouth-belvedere-wrecked/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The 1930s Ford Model A was “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wrecked-mustangs-now-living-the-salvage-car-life/">damaged beyond repair</a>.” We’re not entirely sure exactly what state it’s in, but we’re guessing it’s not pretty. If in fact the classic Ford is in such bad shape, the driver is lucky to have only injured his arm, since it could’ve been far worse. The car is worth over £25,000 in the UK market, according to a local report.</p>
<p>According to Police Scotland, the accident took place on Southbound A9 at the Greeloaning exit slip road at about 4 am on July 9. The other vehicle, which drove off after the collision, is described as a “white Transit-type van” with a flat bed and canopy over it. Apparently, such vehicles are commonly used by dairies and grocery delivery services in the UK.</p>
<p>Police Scotland are hopeful someone will step forward with information about the car accident. They’re looking for anyone who might have driven by the wreck or seen it happen. Even better, police are asking for anyone who might have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-driver-wrecks/">dashcam footage</a>of the collision, which they said was bad enough there was no way the other driver wouldn’t have noticed.</p>
<p>If you live in the UK and want to offer up any information about this accident, police ask that you call 101 and quote reference 0417 of July 9. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can alternatively call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111.</p>
