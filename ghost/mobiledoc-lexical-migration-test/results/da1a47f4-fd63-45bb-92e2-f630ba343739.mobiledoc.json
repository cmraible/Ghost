These trucks might look like Chevy's classic C/K pickups, but they are full custom builds that include hand-made metal to create the four-door cabs. Rtech starts with a factory truck (usually one that's in need of a restoration anyway), and it fabricates the roof, rear doors and rocker panels in-house for the Crew Cab effect, and then sets the modified body on top of a restored and modernized chassis from a one-ton Chevy C30."

Each truck is bespoke and tailored to the specific customer, and these show trucks are about as decked out as Rtech can get with modern amenities inside the cab and a tuned Cummins turbo-diesel under the hood. After this appearance, the yellow-and-white Duke will be getting an overhaul that includes a twin-turbo upgrade good for around 1,000 horsepower."
