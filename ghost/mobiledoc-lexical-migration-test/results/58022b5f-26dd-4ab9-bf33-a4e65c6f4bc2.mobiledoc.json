At some point, Ford swapped out this engine and transformed the car into a Boss 351 prototype at which time the VIN was amended to reflect the 351 cubic-inch four-barrel V8. By the time this car was finally sold in February 25, 1971, though, it featured a two- barrel 351 V8 under the hood and a production VIN. The entire time, this car retained its original four-speed manual."

As it turns out, one of these experimental Boss 302 engines was sitting in the basement of a former Ford factory worker, and we're sure it took a hefty sum for Perkins to get his hands on that engine. Another interesting aspect of this prototype is that Ford had actually started building service parts for this Boss 302, so he was also able to score some of these for his build as well."
