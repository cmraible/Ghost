They were used to fight wars in the name of freedom, have a reputation for great performance on the offroading trails, and look pretty much ionic to most people. However, the one area that brings them down in terms of value and overall quality is the fact that they are very old vehicles. That's exactly why one man decided to get a full overhaul done on his old Jeep and turn it into something unlike anything previously seen on the classic collector market."

Comfort is a pretty big deal when it comes to driving a classic car as many of those vehicles lack in that department. Thanks to the good work of the truck’s builders, this Jeep also looks a lot different from its stock counterpart with wider body work and some incredibly thick offroading tires.

Despite the builder’s claim of about 700 horsepower, the engine was apparently from a Hellcat Red Eye which has an output of around 797 horsepower, a big difference for any vehicle let alone a custom classic.
