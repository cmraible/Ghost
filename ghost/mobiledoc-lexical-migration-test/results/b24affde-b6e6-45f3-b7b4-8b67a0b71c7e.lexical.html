<p>Good things are happening! A federal judge is turning up the heat on Amazon over its labor practices. Meanwhile, Los Angelenos deal a blow to corporate landlords, food delivery workers will see a much-anticipated raise, and the country’s electric bus fleet is about to quadruple.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em> below, a weekly feature reviewing good news, progress, and action steps that’s one of the many features available only to <em>Lever</em> supporting subscribers.</p>
<h3 id="amazon-workers-score-needed-win">Amazon Workers Score Needed Win</h3>
<p>Last Friday, a federal judge filed a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjkmgp/federal-judge-orders-amazon-to-stop-firing-people-for-organizing">cease-and-desist order</a> against Amazon, demanding that the country’s second largest employer stop firing employees for union organizing.</p>
<p>The court order was a response to a petition filed by Gerald Bryson, a former Amazon employee who was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gngk/federal-labor-agency-investigation-finds-amazon-illegally-fired-protesting-warehouse-worker">illegally fired</a> for protesting how Amazon endangered workers during the pandemic in 2020. The court order demands that Amazon immediately stop “discharging employees because they engaged in protected concerted activity” and “in any like or related manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed to them by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.”</p>
<p>Bryson has not yet been reinstated.</p>
<p>“This decision is a massive victory for Amazon workers nationwide — protection from retaliation is especially important as those workers enter the grueling peak season in Amazon’s warehouses,” said Analilia Mejia and DaMareo Cooper, co-executive directors of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, in a <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/11/21/cease-and-desist-order-called-massive-victory-us-amazon-workers">statement</a>. “Nonetheless, continuing to keep Gerald Bryson out of work at this point is a travesty of justice.”</p>
<h3 id="food-delivery-workers-get-pay-boost">Food Delivery Workers Get Pay Boost</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>Under new, much-anticipated <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/9/23/22690509/new-york-city-landmark-food-delivery-worker-law">city rules</a> originally passed in September 2021, New York City’s app-based food delivery workers will get a <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2022/11/16/23462218/grubhub-uber-doordash-food-worker-pay-nyc">boost</a> in pay to $23.82 an hour plus tips by 2025 — an amount that finally accounts for operating costs like safety equipment.</p>
<p>The nearly 60,000 app-based delivery workers for platforms like UberEats and DoorDash who work in New York City are classified as independent contractors and not employees, so they are not currently entitled to a legally binding minimum wage. According to a pay study <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2022/11/16/23462218/grubhub-uber-doordash-food-worker-pay-nyc">obtained</a> by <em>THE CITY</em>, it is estimated that delivery workers in the city currently earn $11.12 an hour including tips after expenses. The new rules will increase pay up to $17.87 on January 1, 2023, and then bring the amount to $23.82 by April 1, 2025.</p>

<h3 id="los-angeles-passes-%E2%80%9Cmansion-tax%E2%80%9D">Los Angeles Passes “Mansion Tax”</h3>
<p>Last week, a final vote tally delivered a win for Los Angeles’ ballot Measure United to House L.A. (ULA) — an initiative that will raise taxes on the sale of multimillion dollar properties to address the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Huge corporate landlords and realtor lobbying groups poured more than $5 million into <a href="__GHOST_URL__/real-estate-industry-spends-big-to-crush-la-mansion-tax/">efforts to crush</a> the measure, so the fact that it passed with nearly <a href="https://results.lavote.gov/#year=2022&election=4300">60 percent</a> support represents a resounding rejection of big business domination of the housing market.</p>
<p>The “Mansion Tax” is expected to create between $600 million and $1 billion annually by increasing the transfer tax on property sales above $5 million. Like so many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-working-peoples-issues-won-on-election-night/">positive initiatives</a> that came from the midterm elections, this ballot measure was created by working people.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>ULA was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-12/lopez-column-citizens-led-the-way-on-la-homelessness-tax-measure">spearheaded</a> by a multiracial coalition of labor officials, housing advocates, and working people struggling with <a href="http://latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-03/for-50-million-in-the-land-of-tents-this-condo-could-be-yours-as-l-a-prices-and-misery-index-both-rise">untenable</a> housing costs.</p>
<p>“We had over 830 volunteers on this campaign,” Laura Raymond, co-chair of the ULA campaign, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-12/lopez-column-citizens-led-the-way-on-la-homelessness-tax-measure">told</a> the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> about its election outreach. “One of the things that’s keeping me happiest this week is the number of people who came out to knock on doors, talk to neighbors, and make sure they got to the polls.”</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em>’s own Aditi Ramaswami <a href="__GHOST_URL__/real-estate-industry-spends-big-to-crush-la-mansion-tax/">wrote</a>, “If it passes, Measure ULA would pave the way for a bold new approach that involves one of the largest and potentially most impactful ‘mansion taxes’ of its kind, one that’s been designed to have a major citizen-led impact on affordable housing.”</p>
<h3 id="oregon-pardons-thousands-of-simple-marijuana-offenses">Oregon Pardons Thousands Of Simple Marijuana Offenses</h3>
<p>Outgoing Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/11/21/oregon-governor-pardons-45000-marijuana-offenders-bid-right-wrongs-failed-drug-war">pardoned</a> more than 45,000 thousand of people convicted of simple marijuana offenses before leaving office on January 9, 2023. Unlike President Joe Biden’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-bidens-midterm-marijuana-play/">recent federal pardons</a>, Brown’s pardon will go into immediate effect and also apply to non-U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>“No one deserves to be forever saddled with the impacts of a conviction for simple possession of marijuana — a crime that is no longer on the books in Oregon,” Brown said in a <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=76442">statement</a>. “Oregonians should never face housing insecurity, employment barriers, and educational obstacles as a result of doing something that is now completely legal, and has been for years. My pardon will remove these hardships.”</p>
<p>Even though the pardon for simple offenses — possession of an ounce or less — <a href="https://twitter.com/OJRCenter/status/1594832678393884672">falls far short </a>of freeing people currently incarcerated for other marijuana offenses, the pardon will have a large <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3NEVl9zmq6yz-Rtc8lg8InbZWQ04bYl/view">material impact</a> by forgiving $14 million in fines and fees for those affected.</p>

<h3 id="electric-buses-get-money-in-the-tank">Electric Buses Get Money In The Tank</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the month, the Biden administration announced that it was going to spend <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/electric-school-buses-to-get-1b-boost-from-biden-administration?utm_campaign=canary&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=232382016&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--wzd1JnSLoTcIEs8o4Llw3WiNtewt8It4NqSkjBSHGhOxtF--lEJqVeYQPx_TMaqCOUIN0rjUV0Di0BaTiJIxanyz-7w&utm_source=newsletter">$1 billion</a> to cover the costs of nearly 2,300 new electric school buses, quadrupling the country’s current stock. The new buses will help service nearly 400 school districts across the country, including in Puerto Rico and American Samoa.</p>
<p>This week, California has joined in by pumping up its own <a href="https://stnonline.com/news/california-ups-investment-in-electric-school-buses-for-disadvantaged-areas/">investment</a> in zero-emission public school transportation, setting out $1.8 billion for zero-emissions school buses over the next five years that will largely support rural and low-income communities.</p>

<h3 id="finally">Finally:</h3>
<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Wendy Cope’s poem about ordinary things, “<a href="https://www.slowdownshow.org/episode/2022/10/19/787-the-orange">The Orange</a>”:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
<p>At lunchtime I bought a huge orange —<br>The size of it made us all laugh.<br>I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave —<br>They got quarters and I had a half.</p>
<p>And that orange, it made me so happy,<br>As ordinary things often do<br>Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br>This is peace and contentment. It’s new.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was quite easy.<br>I did all the jobs on my list<br>And enjoyed them and had some time over.<br>I love you. I’m glad I exist.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
