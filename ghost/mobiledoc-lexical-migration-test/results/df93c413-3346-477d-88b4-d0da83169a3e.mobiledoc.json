          "According to the listing, the restoration took the car's body down to bare metal before repainting it in its original orange hue. The Montreal was designed by Marcello Ganbini from the Italian design firm, Bertone, and he was also responsible for the styling of the Lamborghini Miura, which is obvious when comparing the two cars side by side. Under the hood, this Alfa Romeo features a four-cam 2.6-liter V8 mated to a five-speed manual gearbox, and this drivetrain has been fully rebuilt to ensure this car is ready for cruising or showing. Even before its restoration, this Montreal was an award winner at the 2014 Concorso Italiano."

On the outside, this car is fitted with 15x7-inch wheels wrapped in modern performance tires, and the interior has been tastefully customized with a black and orange Alcantara-trimmed interior. For improved driving performance, the car's stock suspension and brakes were also upgraded, and the latter includes a disc brake swap from a BMW 733i. The result should make this vintage Italian beauty handle like a modern exotic sports car."
