<p>Over the weekend, protesters gathered in Atlanta, Georgia, to mourn the police killing last Wednesday of <a href="https://atlantapresscollective.com/2023/01/19/justice-for-tort/">Tortuguita</a>, a 26-year-old environmental activist fighting the planned construction of so-called “Cop City,” the largest police and fire department training facility of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>Give us five minutes of your time in this new edition of Cheat Sheet, and we’ll explain how Atlanta arrived at this moment, and what the conflict reveals about the politics and finances of U.S. policing, land defense and environmental justice, and whose voices matter most in the discourse on resource allocation.</p>
<h3 id="nuts-and-bolts">NUTS AND BOLTS</h3>
<p>Activists in Atlanta, Georgia, have spent the last two years battling city officials and law enforcement over a city-approved plan to build a $90-million training center for police and firefighters, in an alleged attempt to reduce crime.</p>
<p>The training facility, dubbed “Cop City” by protesters, would be built on 85 acres of former plantation and prison farm land in unincorporated Dekalb County, land the Atlanta City Council voted to lease to the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) for <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/cop-city">just $10 a year</a>. The center is supposed to include a shooting range, a mock village complete with a fake night club and other amenities, and a park named after former first lady Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Atlanta City Council greenlit the plan <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2021/09/08/atlanta-city-council-approves-cop-city-training-facility-despite-public-opposition/">in 2021 on a 10-4 vote</a> following 17 hours of public comment, the vast majority of which was in opposition to the proposal.</p>

<p>The project is being spearheaded by APF, a private nonprofit working to support law enforcement in Atlanta. On its website, the APF <a href="https://atlantapolicefoundation.org/programs/public-safety-training-center/">touts</a> the new training center as setting “a national standard for community engagement, neighborhood sensitivity, and devotion to the civil rights of all citizens by law enforcement.” But opponents of the plan instead say the project is a way to <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/cop-city">further militarize</a> law enforcement in a community that has long faced <a href="https://atlantapolicefoundation.org/programs/operation-shield/">over-policing and surveillance</a>.</p>
<p>Activists, whose clarion call of “Stop Cop City” <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/23/cop-city-atlanta-protests/">has drawn</a> national attention, <a href="https://stopcop.city">say that</a> the “Atlanta Police Foundation is trying to build the largest police training facility in the U.S. in Weelaunee Forest, a watershed surrounded by primarily Black residents who overwhelmingly oppose the project.”</p>
<h3 id="forest-defenders">FOREST DEFENDERS</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>In addition to protesters’ concerns about police militarization, activists have also opposed the proposal on environmental grounds. They say building the sprawling campus would harm much of the South River Forest, <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/verify-urban-forest-atlanta-public-safety-training-facility/85-5933f5a5-2e9b-4db3-bc30-31b9fb9a0974">one of the largest</a> urban forests in the southeast region.</p>
<p>In August 2021, the Sierra Club’s Georgia chapter led a letter to Atlanta’s mayor and city council urging them to oppose the project. The letter <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/georgia/blog/2021/08/SouthRiverForestLetter">pointed out</a> that the region’s tree canopy can help stave off some of the worst effects of the climate crisis locally, including flooding and extreme heat, and argued that building the training facility on the land of the South River Forest would be “devastating for the ecological community.”</p>
<p>Since 2021, a few dozen “Stop Cop City” protesters, with the support of the direct action advocacy organization <a href="https://defendtheatlantaforest.org">Defend the Atlanta Forest</a>, have been occupying the forest to defend the land, which many call the Weelaunee Forest in recognition of its original Muscogee Creek inhabitants.</p>
<p>Forest defenders have increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/21/protester-killed-georgia-cop-city-police-shooting">faced</a><a href="https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/little-turtles-war-cop-city-atlanta">violent</a> police raids in recent months. Just last week, roughly <a href="https://gbi.georgia.gov/press-releases/2023-01-23/gbi-investigates-officer-involved-shooting-following-multi-agency">25 campsites were removed</a> and seven protesters were charged with domestic terrorism and criminal trespass, among other pending charges.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, during one of these raids, police shot and killed forest defender Tortuguita. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has claimed Tortuguita refused to exit their tent and fired the first shot. Activists have <a href="https://theappeal.org/atlanta-cop-city-police-killing-manuel-teran-tortuguita/">questioned</a> this version of events. Tortuguita had <a href="https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2022/the-forest-for-the-trees-atlanta-prison-farm">publicly preached</a> nonviolence.</p>
<p>A Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesperson <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/23/cop-city-atlanta-protests/">has said</a> that “we do not have bodycam footage of the shooting incident.”</p>
<p>According to experts, the circumstances of Tortuguita’s death — a forest protector being shot and killed by police — is <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLMahoney/status/1617685764460130304?t=JBVuS90o-3tH_z784TWz4A&s=19">unprecedented</a><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/170142/atlanta-police-shooting-warning-sign-safety-environmental-activists">in the U.S.</a></p>
<h3 id="following-the-money">FOLLOWING THE MONEY</h3>
<p>One third of the $90 million to be spent on the training facility would be supplied by taxpayers, with the APF <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-south/the-new-fight-over-an-old-forest-in-atlanta">footing the rest</a> of the bill. APF and a related nonprofit reported having $54 million in assets at the end of 2021, according to an audited financial <a href="https://atlantapolicefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Atlanta-Police-Foundation-Inc-and-APF-Support-Inc-2021-Audited-Financial-Statements-FAC.pdf">statement</a> on its website.</p>
<p>Last June, the Atlanta City Council voted to approve a $236 million budget for its police force — an amount that increased two percent from the prior year, and accounted for <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2022/06/22/atlanta-city-council-approves-2023-budget/">more than a third</a> of the city’s total budget. Disproportionate spending on law enforcement is not uncommon throughout the country, with the U.S. spending <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/world/defund-police-crime-social-welfare-intl/index.html">more money per capita</a> on public safety than most other developed nations, while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/07/over-past-60-years-more-spending-police-hasnt-necessarily-meant-less-crime/">falling short</a> of making communities safer.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it’s not just tax dollars being funneled into police departments. The APF is just <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-south/the-new-fight-over-an-old-forest-in-atlanta">one example</a> of a larger pattern of increasingly powerful private nonprofits working to expand already overblown police budgets — often via corporate funding fueled by consumer spending. Executives from Waffle House, the Atlanta Hawks, Home Depot, and Delta Air Lines <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-south/the-new-fight-over-an-old-forest-in-atlanta">sit on</a> APF’s board. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, has also donated to the foundation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Atlanta-based media conglomerate Cox Enterprises <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-south/the-new-fight-over-an-old-forest-in-atlanta">has contributed</a> to APF, while its CEO, Alex Taylor, serves as the fundraising chair for the new training facility. The city’s largest newspaper, which Cox owns, has <a href="https://www.ajc.com/opinion/opinion-crime-wave-should-spur-action-on-center/E2G7BMPL2BEZHPOW4AOJBXUG64/">published</a> editorials in support of the facility while only sometimes disclosing its owners’ financial contributions to the APF.</p>

<h3 id="vilifying-protesters">VILIFYING PROTESTERS</h3>
<p>In the wake of the police shooting of Tortuguita, corporate media and local news outlets have helped police and elected officials shift the narrative and make the story about out-of-control, violent protests — distracting people from the concerns voiced by environmental and social justice activists about the training facility.</p>
<p>Outlets have <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/atlanta-riots-timeline-stop-cop-city-movement-apd-training-facility">described</a> forest defenders as fighting “against the training facility’s construction by committing crimes,” and highlighted local <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2023/01/22/atlanta-cop-city-protest-violence-kayyem-nr-brown-sot-vpx.cnn">property</a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cop-city-protesters-damage-property-protest-atlanta/">damage</a> — while neglecting to mention the <a href="https://twitter.com/hannahcrileyy/status/1617178406164262914">other ways</a> that protesters long used to try to stop construction of the training facility. A <em>Daily Beast </em><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-police-protest-in-atlanta-over-cop-city-launched-a-domestic-terrorism-warzone">headline</a> read: “How a Police Protest in Atlanta Launched a ‘Domestic Terrorism’ Warzone.”</p>
<p>Such “terrorism” rhetoric has been <a href="https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/little-turtles-war-cop-city-atlanta">used for some time by</a> public officials and police alike. According to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/21/protester-killed-georgia-cop-city-police-shooting"><em>Guardian</em></a>, Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other civic leaders at some point began referring to the protesters as “terrorists.” Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum called breaking windows and setting fires “terrorism.”</p>
<p>In 2021, Atlanta’s then-Democratic mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms painted the activists opposing Cop City as dangerous, <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2021/09/09/mayor-law-enforcement-celebrate-approval-of-cop-city-training-facility-despite-public-opposition/">saying</a>, “When you bully me, try to terrorize me, it’s the end of the conversation.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the narrative from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that Tortuguita fired the first shot last Wednesday has gained traction — <a href="https://twitter.com/SDonziger/status/1616959856593846273?t=BRLDP0p2EqiZE9pm26TznA&s=19">sparking</a><a href="https://twitter.com/RepCori/status/1617636003061334017?t=0rdRqFzoFHt-FL8FiTXv7w&s=19">calls</a> by some for an independent investigation into the activist’s death.</p>
<p>As lawyer and political commentator Olayemi Olurin <a href="https://twitter.com/msolurin/status/1617612243113496585?t=ooLybozLkOidT21VfPBkEw&s=19">said</a>, “The media does their best to interpret and portray any, any level of pushback and resistance by the protesters as riots, all while ignoring the fact that police officers entered their home, murdered this kid in order to continue their efforts to create an entire mock city where they can practice doing the same to the rest of the Atlanta residents.”</p>
<p>City officials and police have also tried to paint the protesters as agitators from <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/23/cop-city-atlanta-protests/">outside the state</a> who have little understanding of the local community — a messaging tactic that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/outside-agitators-history-civil-rights.html">dates back to</a> the civil rights era, when the term “outside agitator” was used to imply links to communism and deflect from demonstrators’ human rights demands. “It should be noted that these individuals were not Atlanta or Georgia residents. Most of them traveled into our city to wreak havoc,” said Mayor Andre Dickens at a press conference. Unmentioned was a city <a href="https://twitter.com/RevSouthNolan/status/1617903472694931456?t=yAQtFDOJvjhAUjJWY7pYRw&s=19">survey finding</a> that 43 percent of trainees at the Cop City facility will be recruited from out of the state.</p>
