          "The problem with private debt collection companies like Linebarger acting as arms of the court, say activists, is that unlike the court, they have no incentive to let debtors off the hook. The firm’s profit model is built on extraction, leaving debtors without any options. Worse, there are some instances where unpaid court debt can lead to jail time, such as the debtor is found to be deliberately avoiding payment or happens to live in a jurisdiction that still relies on "

The only winners are the shareholders at predatory companies like Linebarger. Policymakers have much more efficient — and much more equitable — ways of raising revenue at their disposal.”"
