The two tone silver cars first race was at Elkhart Lake as number 77 and quickly caught the eye of other drivers. One such driver was JLP Racings own "

          " picked up the innovative 2” chromoly tube chassis from Protofab in the summer of 1977 and began assembly of his Corvette race car at his shop in Lawrenceville, Ga. Utilizing a narrower track and more aerodynamic bodywork than Greenwoods Corvette for a grab at a higher top speed for the car, Paul Sr. implemented a few design changes. Likewise, he steered away from the Greenwood power plant and opted instead for a 750-horsepower aluminum big block, featuring a Kinsler mechanical fuel injection, left over from Don Nichols and Shadow Racing's Can-Am days."

Being that this is such a rare car with an incredible racing history, a full restoration to its original JLP Racing livery was in order. Every part of the car was disassembled, inspected, refinished, and refurbished and what’s left is as close to the original form of the car that John Paul Sr. premiered at Road Atlanta in 1978."
