Painted in the factory shade of Chevy Orange, the engine is equipped with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, aluminum intake manifold, and longtube headers that send spent gases through a dual exhaust. A chrome open air cleaner and chrome valve covers add to the engine bay aesthetic. The Chevelle also features performance spark plug wires, coil, and distributor. Power steering allows for maneuvering corners with ease, and power brakes bring everything to a halt. "
