Thanks to the full restoration, the seals are tight so you don’t have to deal with rattling or leaks. Also, the interior was gutted completely and a sound deadener was applied before everything was refurbished and reinstalled. Among the details is a new gold instrument panel with mint condition rally gauges. Hand-stitched leather on the formula wheel is a nice touch. Fresh upholstery on the seats means you’ll see zero damage. There are even embroidered floormats, a touch which really makes this car shine."
