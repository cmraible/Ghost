To give a brief overview, Ford delivered 252 1965 K-code Mustangs from the San Jose plant to Shelby American before shutting down the factory to retool for the 1966 model year. This was done to help ensure Shelby wouldn’t run out of cars while the production line wasn’t churning any out."

Since there are so few of them, these cars which combine the handling dynamics of the 1965 model year with the looks of the 1966 are highly sought after by collectors. Whenever one is consigned for an auction or otherwise makes a public appearance it can cause a real stir."

The interior is fairly dirty but not that bad and you can see a nice crack in the windshield, but the car is still in amazing condition."
