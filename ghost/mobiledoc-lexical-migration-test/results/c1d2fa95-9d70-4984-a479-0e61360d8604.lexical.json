And at the other end of the scale, the tech elite are proving that they don't understand the concept of a free press. It's quite striking how people who have used the language of connecting people and making a better world to get very, very rich use very different language on their own.‌‌‌‌ And as long as that kind of hypocrisy is doing the rounds, there will be a need for good journalism.</p><p>There have been times during lockdown, when my income was looking shaky, and the industry started its quiet implosion, that I wondered if I wanted to stay in journalism. But reading stories like the Lean Back Read below makes me realise that what we do is important - and we need to get better at it.</p><p>A few more links than normal today, just to keep you entertained over the weekend.
