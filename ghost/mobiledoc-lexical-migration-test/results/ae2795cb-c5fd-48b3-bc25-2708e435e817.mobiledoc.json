Another car is stopped and waiting to turn, but for whatever reason the Mopar driver didn’t slow down. Instead, they swerve around the stopped car, almost T-bone another vehicle traveling down Richmond Road, then careen into the deli parking lot and finally strike the column in front of the restaurant so hard the backend of the muscle car lurched into the air before crashing back to the pavement."

Charges included driving while intoxicated. According to the local report, Lamey refused to take a breathalyzer test after admitting to drinking “one or two” glasses of wine before getting behind the wheel."
