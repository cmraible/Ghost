Powering the Harley was a 74” U-series flathead with a 3-speed transmission. However, because the New York Police Department had very specific requirements for its fleet motorcycles to ensure reliability, the company had to add a magneto ignition connected to a generator, instead of using a battery. In fact, the “MG” in UMG stands for “mag generator.”"
