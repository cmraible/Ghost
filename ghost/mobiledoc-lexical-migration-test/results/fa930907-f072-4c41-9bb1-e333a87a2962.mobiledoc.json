Located in Jonesville, North Carolina, the car was purchased brand new by an 83-year-old woman and her husband. Sadly, her husband passed away 14 years ago, and she has decided to sell the car. The listing states that the car has always been garage-kept and has just 24,600 actual miles on the clock. Even North Carolina has signed and notarized a mileage statement that states that the number is actual and correct. The fact that this classic is listed at $25,600."
