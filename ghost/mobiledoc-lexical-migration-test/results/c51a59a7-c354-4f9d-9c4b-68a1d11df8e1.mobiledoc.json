In other words, he’s not a gearhead, so the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle he drives in the movie perfectly suits his persona. It’s unassuming, cheap, and unthreatening. Fortunately, he doesn’t need to take the little German car on a high-speed chase, because he would’ve been outmatched by almost any other vehicle on the road."

On a cold, snowy morning while Billy is trying to coax the car to start, next door neighbor Mr. Futterman takes it as an opportunity to bash foreign cars. Refreshingly, the script never takes sides in what was a heated debate back in 1984 but instead portrays the outrage many like Futterman felt about the destabilization of the Big Three as Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and others made further inroads into the US market."

Since we’re not heavy equipment experts and it’s hard to get a truly good look at the thing, we’re going to say it’s open to debate."

It’s refreshingly true to how people don’t all drive new vehicles (something filmmakers seem to struggle with in a lot of period pieces). Notable to us is a 1982 Chevy Camaro Billy runs past on his way to work after his Beetle won’t start. Sure, it’s nothing super special, but it’s the only thing close to a muscle car in the entire film."
