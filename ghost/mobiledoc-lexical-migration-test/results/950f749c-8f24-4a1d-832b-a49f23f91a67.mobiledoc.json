Under the hood is an LSX 454 that produces 627 horsepower and 586 lb-ft of torque, and it's fitted to an Andrews A431 four-speed manual and a NASCAR-spec nine-inch rear end. There are a total of six powertrain configurations, which also includes options like a 725-horsepower dry-sump V8 engine as well as choices of a five- and six-speed sequential transmissions. In addition to these powertrain options, buyers have plenty of other choices to make when building their Track Attack car including six-point racing harnesses, fire-suppression system, on-board cameras added to the telemetry system and more."
