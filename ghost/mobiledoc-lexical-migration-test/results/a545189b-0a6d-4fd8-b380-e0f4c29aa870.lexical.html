<p>Only two owners have owned this blown Challenger, and it's ready to rumble with just about any other production car out there. It's powered by the king of all production engines, the Hellcat 6.2-liter superchaged Hemi engine, rated at 707-horsepower, giving it a 0 to 62 mph sprint in just 3.6 seconds when using the stock Launch Control feature. The top speed has also increased over the non-Hellcat Challengers to an eye-popping 205 mph.</p>

<p>Unlike many examples out there, besides a Legmaker cold air intake, this is a stock Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat, so you can choose how to modify it, or leave it alone and enjoy its natural prowess. Traction is handled by a set of Pirelli P Zero tires, and braking power comes from the Brembo brake system that features slotted rotors. </p>
