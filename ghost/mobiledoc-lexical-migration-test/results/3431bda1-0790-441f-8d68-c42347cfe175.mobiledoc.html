<p>Friends, thereâ€™s been a slight change of plans: </p>
<p><strong>Todayâ€™s Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a>, will be starting at 3:30pm ET</strong> (instead of 5pm ET). David Sirota will be joined by <em>The Intercept</em>â€™s Ryan Grim to discuss the Biden administrationâ€™s recent decision to side with railroad barons and push Congress to force through the railroad contract that workers rejected. Theyâ€™ll also be taking questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
