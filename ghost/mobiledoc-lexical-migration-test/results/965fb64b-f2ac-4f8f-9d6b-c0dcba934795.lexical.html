<p>Good things are happening! States are taking on the fossil fuel industry through a plastics investigation, a ban on fossil fuels in new buildings, and by challenging the crypto industry’s ambitions to repurpose power plants for bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, teachers in Oakland took a risk by walking off the job to protest the closure of public schools. And you can pitch in to send Starbucks and Amazon workers to a labor conference.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of You Love To See It, exclusively for supporting subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cenough-is-enough%E2%80%9D-on-plastics">“ENOUGH IS ENOUGH” ON PLASTICS</h3>
<p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/28/1095305949/california-is-investigating-big-oil-for-allegedly-misleading-the-public-on-recyc">launched an investigation</a> into the fossil fuel industry for misleading the public about plastics. Bonta has already subpoenaed documents from the oil giant ExxonMobil as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>“Enough is enough,” Bonta said in a statement announcing the investigation. “For more than half a century, the plastics industry has engaged in an aggressive campaign to deceive the public, perpetuating a myth that recycling can solve the plastics crisis. The truth is: The vast majority of plastic cannot be recycled, and the recycling rate has never surpassed 9 percent.”</p>
<h3 id="washington-to-electrify-buildings">WASHINGTON TO ELECTRIFY BUILDINGS</h3>
<p>Washington just became the <a href="https://grist.org/buildings/washington-state-requires-electric-heat-pumps-buildings/">first state to require</a> new buildings to be constructed with all-electric heating systems.</p>
<p>The state updated its building code to require that new commercial buildings and multifamily buildings install heat pumps — energy efficient and electric-power technologies used to heat and cool homes.</p>
<p>The move comes as New York state, controlled by a Democratic governor and Democratic supermajorities in both branches of the legislature, has failed to pass legislation requiring new buildings to be heated with electricity. Perhaps Washington’s move <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2022/04/washington-state-takes-strongest-clean-commercial-building-action-nation">will spur other states</a> to action!</p>
<h3 id="new-york-reigns-in-crypto">NEW YORK REIGNS IN CRYPTO</h3>
<p>As Bitcoin mining wreaks <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">havoc</a> in upstate New York communities, the New York Assembly finally took some modest action, <a href="https://twitter.com/AASchapiro/status/1519179405557264384?s=20&t=NVVoTgasvvqtZ494UqDguA">banning</a> any new bitcoin mining that would rely on new fossil fuel capacity for the next two years. Kudos to Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, a Democrat, for taking the lead on this. The bill now moves to the state Senate, where the Bitcoin industry is expected to fight it aggressively.</p>
<h3 id="oakland-teachers-walk-out-to-defend-public-education">OAKLAND TEACHERS WALK OUT TO DEFEND PUBLIC EDUCATION</h3>
<p>3,000 teachers and other public school workers <a href="https://abc7news.com/oakland-teachers-strike-friday-school-closures-one-day-district-ousd-oea/11803532/">walked</a> off the job in Oakland on Friday for a one-day strike over plans by the city’s school board to close a dozen schools over the next two years. What’s most impressive about this job action is that the teachers did it in the face of a pledge by the school board that they would seek to find the job action illegal.</p>
<p>More importantly, they sought to make the day as fun as possible for kids out of school, inviting community members to a block party at Oakland’s Lake Merritt to celebrate the defense of public education.</p>
<p>There’s a rule in new labor organizing that when the organizing committee is happy and feeling good — even in the face of overwhelming adversity — you’re going to win. Kudos to Oakland educators on embodying that principle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Starbucks worker organizing continues apace, with the <a href="https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited">@sbworkersunited</a> Twitter feed being the equivalent of a sage cleanse of our collective timelines. In Augusta, Georgia, Starbucks workers on Thursday won — via a vote of 25-5 — the first union Starbucks in the Peach State. The day before, the first Starbucks store in Wisconsin went union. Starbucks Workers United has now won <a href="https://twitter.com/greenhousenyt/status/1520051299370291201">41</a> out of 44 union elections, despite Starbucks spending $500 an hour on the anti-union law firm Littler Mendelson.</p>
<p>Our comrades at <a href="https://labornotes.org/"><em>Labor Notes</em></a><em></em>are <a href="https://twitter.com/JonahFurman/status/1517573030679089152?s=20&t=dIzUvfEEmYKF9KBWiOpajA">raising money</a> to bring Starbucks and Amazon workers to their biannual conference, the largest gathering of troublemakers in North America, where over three thousand trade unionists gather to exchange ideas and learn skills to bring capital to heel.</p>
