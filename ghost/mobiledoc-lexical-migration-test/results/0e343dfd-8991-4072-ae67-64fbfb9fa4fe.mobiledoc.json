Highlights include the nitrided crankshaft, Edmunds intake manifold, JE pistons, forged connecting rods, dual Holley carburetors, a high-torque starter, and a Moroso electrical cutoff switch. Suspension consists of a swing-axle setup that includes coil springs up front and transverse leaf spring and radius rods in the back. Front brakes come from a late-1940s Lincoln, and Ford drums can be found on the solid rear end. Custom exhaust headers were fabricated by GMT Racing in 2000 and send spent gases through a dual side-outlet exhaust setup. Work performed on the car this year includes a tune-up and detailing, a new clutch, spark plugs, and fluids. "

          "Back in the mid-1980s, this Lister-Jaguar Costin tribute was built in New Zealand by the Tempero Coach & Motor Company. There, the car was raced in the '90s in hillclimbs and road races, but it was refurbished after it made its way back to Tempero. A Jaguar collector in the United States named Terry Larson had it imported and put on display in Las Vegas at the Imperial Palace."

More exterior highlights include a rear decklid with louvers, roll hoop, side-exit exhaust, covered headlamps, outside hood latches, knock-off 15-inch Dunlop wheels wrapped with Pirelli Cinturato tires, and a polished fuel-filler cap.

Stopping is provided by four-wheel disc brakes, and handling is on point thanks to an independent rear suspension. A rear sway bar and low-mounted fuel tank were added back in 1993."

Everything else is simplistic on this car, titled as a 1959 Jaguar. The dashboard houses gauges including a Smiths tachometer and a 140-mph speedometer, oil pressure, water temperature, and a Lucas ammeter. The 5-digit speedometer shows 73,000 miles."
