The incident, which happened on the evening of October 14, began with three suspects taking the Mopar muscle car from the owner at gunpoint earlier. After crashing, the men jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot."

          "The rise in vehicle thefts has become quite the problem in the past two years or so. Initially, many news outlets blamed the problem solely on the covid lockdowns and economic unrest. However, even as those factors have waned or even gone away, car thefts have kept going strong. The theory also ignores the fact that the crime wave started well before anyone heard of COVID-19. One of the favorite targets of thieves are the Dodge Charger and Challenger, prompting Stellantis to roll out enhanced security features to be installed in certain models but not all. The hope is that will help stop this trend, but whether or not it’s effective remains to be seen."
