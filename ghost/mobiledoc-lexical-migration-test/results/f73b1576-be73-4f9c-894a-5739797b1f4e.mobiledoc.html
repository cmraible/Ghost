<p>Talking of Apple News, 9to5Mac pulled an interesting tidbit from Tim Cook's comments in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/29/apple-news-music-active-devices/">today's Apple earnings call</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Cook shared on the earnings call that the company saw its monthly active user rate for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-news/">Apple News</a> hit 85M. Apple News rolling out to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/24/ios-12-2-apple-news-canada/">more countries will also help drive growth</a>. Apple is also rumored to be planning a paid <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/12/apple-news-subscription-service-spring/">news subscription service launching as early as this spring</a>.</blockquote>
<p>That's a pretty decent number, given that Apple News is still only available in the US, UK and Australia. Canada appears to be next in line.</p>
<p>Apple News has slowly become a stealth success - and Apple appears to have some interesting plans for it this year. One to watch.</p>
