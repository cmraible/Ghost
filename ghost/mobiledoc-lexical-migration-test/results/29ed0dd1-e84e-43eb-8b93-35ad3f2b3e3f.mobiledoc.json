So it seems odd that for the episode included with this article there’s a Time Attack 2008 Chevy Corvette Z06 versus a 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R. Yes, one is a heavily-modified race car and the other is a slightly modified street car, so it doesn’t really feel like a fair race."

That huge front splitter, massive rear wing, vented hood, front fender ports, and side-exit exhaust right behind the front wheels is enough to intimidate. On top of that, this thing has a 427ci LS7 V8 pushing 900-horsepower (on low boost or 1200-hp on high boost) and a 6-speed sequential transmission backing that up. With a curb weight of just 2,950 lbs. this would be a tough car to beat in any race."

A 5-speed transmission and the 3,153 lb. curb weight put it at a disadvantage as well. On paper, the only thing going for this Nissan is the all-wheel-drive system, which can help a car hook up in a hurry."

All that aero might be a disadvantage to flat-out, straight-line acceleration. Or it might not. You’ll just have to watch the video to see what happens."
