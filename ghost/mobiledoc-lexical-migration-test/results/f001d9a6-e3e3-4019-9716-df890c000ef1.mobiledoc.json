Well, that’s exactly what this beautiful bluebird is, wn overpowered monster with enough aerodynamic efficiency to stick it to the track for as long as it needs. To this car, 200 miles an hour seems like chump change on any racing circuit."

On top of that, as you might expect, the rest of the car has been beefed up everywhere from the chassis to the suspension to be able to handle such a high number. Originally made to baffle a competition in one of America’s most prominent motor sport series, this Plymouth is still kicking ass and taking names on the regular. That’s why you might label this car the best modified super bird out there."
