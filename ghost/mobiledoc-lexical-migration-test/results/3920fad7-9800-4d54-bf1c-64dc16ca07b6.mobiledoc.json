Of the 548 'Cuda convertibles produced in 1970, only 155 were said to have come from the factory with this combination. This 275 horsepower engine had the lowest rating of the available 'Cuda engines, and that's also why this model is more affordable. At the end of the day, it's still rare, it's still a 'Cuda and it's still convertible."
