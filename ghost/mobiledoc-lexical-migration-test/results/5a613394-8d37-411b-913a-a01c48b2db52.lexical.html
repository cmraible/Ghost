<p>“Would you rather she'd taken a vow of poverty and spent her non-government work time sitting in a convent scribbling formulas with a quill pen?” - former Foreign Policy editor <a href="https://twitter.com/djrothkopf/status/1345032289068134403?s=20">David Rothkopf</a>, on Janet Yellen’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-revolving-door/">buckraking from companies</a> lobbying the Treasury Department she’s set to lead.</p>

<p>Doctor Patient Unity, a dark money campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/upshot/surprise-billing-laws-ad-spending-doctor-patient-unity.html">funded</a> by private equity-owned hospital staffing companies, spent $75 million in 2019 to kill bipartisan legislation to end "surprise medical bills," according to a new tax return obtained by <em>The Daily Poster.</em> Congress finally passed a surprise billing fix, but it was watered down by the private equity industry and will likely <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/21/surprise-billing-health-providers-congress-449759">drive up</a> health care costs.</p>

<p>Vice President Mike Pence will certify the electoral college vote this Wednesday, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2021/01/02/952861357/more-republicans-announce-plans-to-object-to-electoral-college-results">Pence and Republican lawmakers</a> are planning <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-republicans-fight-new-congress/2021/01/03/27eff4d0-4dd4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">a last-ditch effort</a> to help Trump steal the election. In November, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pence-and-gop-senators-could/">we interviewed</a> Harvard University law professor Larry Lessig about how this coup attempt will play out, and why it will fall to Senate Republicans to stop it.</p>
<p>Lessig wants you to sign <a href="https://equalcitizens.us/petition-protect-the-will-of-the-people/">this petition</a> demanding Republican Senators “commit that they will not recognize the votes from any slate of electors that has been appointed to override the votes from a slate properly elected under state law.”</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-win"><strong>TODAY’S WIN:</strong></h4>
<p>More than 200 Google employees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/04/more-than-200-us-google-employees-form-union">have signed union cards</a> to institutionalize worker activism at the company and bargain for fair wages and labor protections. “Our union will work to ensure that workers know what they’re working on, and can do their work at a fair wage, without fear of abuse, retaliation or discrimination,” two spokespeople for the union <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/opinion/google-union.html">wrote</a> in a<em> New York Times </em>opinion piece detailing their demands.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>In 2012, corporate lobbyist Jack Abramaoff <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jack-abramoff-the-lobbyists-playbook-30-05-2012/2/">explained to 60 Minutes</a> how D.C.’s proverbial “revolving door” works:</p>
<blockquote><em>When we would become friendly with an office and they were important to us, and the chief of staff was a competent person, I would say or my staff would say to him or her at some point, "You know, when you're done working on the Hill, we'd very much like you to consider coming to work for us." Now the moment I said that to them or any of our staff said that to 'em, that was it. We owned them. And what does that mean? Every request from our office, every request of our clients, everything that we want, they're gonna do. And not only that, they're gonna think of things we can't think of to do.</em></blockquote>

Observers <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/why-is-biden-raising-millions-corporate-cash-virtual-inauguration/">raised questions</a> about all the fundraising for a virtual event, and now the transition <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1346104398368264194?s=20">is now giving VIP donors</a> tickets to a “future in-person event.”</li>
