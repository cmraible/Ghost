There are a couple of bloggers I actively miss, and think *might *be worth the money. Yesterday, I spotted this on [Ruth Gledhill’s blog](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/articles-of-faith/) [paid subscription required, rather obviously]:\n\n<div></div>> <div>A note from Ruth Gledhill </div><div>Thank you for subscribing to The Times and reading this far. I have decided to become a human ‘RSS feed’. I will send out at least one daily email, sent blind to all recipients so no email addresses of other subscribers or commenters are revealed, of updates to the blog.</div><div></div>\n\nIf I may be a little “internetty” for a moment: WTF?\n\n<div></div><div>This actually worries me more than anything else about the Great Paywall of Wapping. Not that Ruth is doing this – that shows a fabulous respect for her readers and understanding that a blog is a community –  but the fact that there isn’t and RSS feed. It can’t be beyond the wit of their technical team to publish a feed that either was free to air, but only contained the link, a headline and perhaps an excerpt, or a full text feed that required authentication (and RSS readers have supported authentication for years).</div><div></div><div>With RSS apps starting to get some traction on mobile devices, this really betrays a deep lack of understanding somewhere in their organisation about how their most engaged – and therefore the most likely to pay – actually find their way to the content. </div><div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top:10px;height:15px\">[![Enhanced by Zemanta](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2010/10/zemified_a6.png?w=960)](http://www.zemanta.com/ \"Enhanced by Zemanta\")<span class=\"zem-script pretty-attribution\"><script defer=\"defer\" src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"
