<h4 id="stuff-i-m-reading-"><strong>Stuff I’m reading:</strong></h4>
<p>• <a href="https://billmoyers.com/story/we-hold-this-truth-to-be-self-evident-its-happening-before-our-very-eyes/">We Hold This Truth to Be Self-Evident: It’s Happening Before Our Very Eyes.</a> (Bill Moyers) — <em>In general, you should read anything and everything that Bill Moyers writes. This one is particularly important — it is about the existential threat to our democracy.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tomgara/economy-recession-coronavirus">The Real Economic Catastrophe Hasn’t Hit Yet. Just Wait For August.</a> (Buzzfeed) — <em>It’s probably going to get worse before it gets better.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/joe-biden-donald-trump-resist-police-brutality-protests">A Joe Biden Presidency Will Require Mass Protests, Too</a> (Jacobin) — <em>One of the biggest political tragedies in our lifetime was after the 2008 election — Obama won (which was good), but then a lot of the country went back to sleep, expecting that the new president would follow through on his campaign promises without any pressure (he didn’t). If Trump is defeated, we cannot make that same mistake again — deference to the new president would be a huge mistake. We will need to be pushing him from Day One.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-do-we-change-america">How Do We Change America?</a> (New Yorker) — <em>“State leaders have been much more adept in calling up the National Guard and coördinating police actions to confront marchers than they were in any of their efforts to curtail the virus. In a show of both cowardice and authoritarianism, Donald Trump threatened to call up the U.S. military to occupy American cities. “Crisis” does not begin to describe the political maelstrom that has been unleashed.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/06/police-brutality-protests-blue-lives-matter/?utm_campaign=theintercept&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Police Attacks On Protesters Are Rooted In A Violent Ideology of Reactionary Grievance</a> (The Intercept) — <em>“Much of the policing community sees itself as separate from the rest of society — and as the nation has witnessed in recent days, in video after shocking video, this well-armed population, imbued with the power to deprive citizens of life and liberty, does not take kindly to those who challenge its authority.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/spacex-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-capitalism">Yes to Space Exploration. No to Space Capitalism.</a> (Jacobin) — <em>I’m a huge fan of space stuff — but it was a tad creepy that this generation’s version of The Right Stuff is being led by private corporations.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/rahm-emanuel-the-worst-man-for-the-moment/">Rahm Emanuel, the Worst Man for the Moment</a> (American Prospect) — <em>The disgraced mayor who left office after a police violence scandal is the absolute worst person to be advising the Democratic presidential nominee.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/tom-cotton-new-york-times/tnamp/?__twitter_impression=true">You Don’t Have to Publish Both Sides When One Side Is Fascism</a> (The Nation) — A good read on the whole Tom Cotton/New York Times controversy.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/z3e4qx/the-coddling-of-the-american-pundit?__twitter_impression=true">The Coddling of the American Pundit</a> (Vice) — <em>Prominent pundits have been insulting protesters. This essay argues that the pundits’ “hysteria is founded in something real: They actually are being left behind by a society and by generations that are taking seriously the ideas they pay lip service to.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/george-floyd-protests-race.html#click=https://t.co/ALEIWZezL4">America, This Is Your Chance</a> (New York Times) — <em>“The coronavirus crisis proved that Mr. Sanders was right all along — that health care and other economic rights should be considered part of our social contract, not special benefits for those who are lucky enough to be employed by companies that grant discretionary benefits. Nobody would have benefited more from Mr. Sanders’s political revolution than black people, and yet the generational divide among black voters affected his campaign.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/12/opinion/coronavirus-doctors.html?auth=login-email&login=email">Doctors Are Covid’s First Historians</a> (New York Times) — <em>Ron Suskind is one of the best journalists, and this video-based report he produced is tremendously important.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf4cea5oObY&feature=emb_title">Police: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a> (HBO) — <em>I want you to watch this entire episode. It’s 30 minutes — you must make the time to watch the entire thing.</em></p>
