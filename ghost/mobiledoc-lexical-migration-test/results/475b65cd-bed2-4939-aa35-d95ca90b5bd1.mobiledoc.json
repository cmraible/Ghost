Sure, these newer 8-, 9-, and 10-speed transmissions are technological wonders. Some shift far quicker than pretty much any human. But the feeling of satisfaction of rowing throw the gears yourself outweighs the benefits of letting the transmission have all the fun. That’s one of many reasons to consider this "

It rides on 19-inch wheels, which were massive for back then, and has those aggressive side scoops contrasting with the overall sleek, smooth exterior for a striking look."
