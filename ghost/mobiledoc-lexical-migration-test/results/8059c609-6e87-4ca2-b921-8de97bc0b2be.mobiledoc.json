Aust doesn’t think the question is funny, retorting that there’s no way anyone else will ever drive any of his cars. You hear that? After this man dies and the Pat Aust Collection goes to auction, he’ll personally haunt each and every enthusiast unlucky enough to have purchased one of his cars. Be scared, be very scared."
