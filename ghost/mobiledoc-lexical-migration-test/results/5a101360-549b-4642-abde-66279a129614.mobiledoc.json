Sadly, not everyone is getting the message, despite our best efforts. For example, this local news broadcast makes it sound like there’s just one organized gang located in the Midwest going around stealing Hellcats. The fact is there are likely many groups engaging in Hellcat thievery. Yes, this and other heists seem organized and probably well-funded, so it’s likely being done by organized crime rings. Hopefully, some authorities will zero in on this activity, especially considering we have a vehicle shortage in this country, making the problem all the worse."
