They called it the Monte Carlo and made a considerable effort to promote it as an attainable luxury car for those who didn't necessarily need, or want, a land boat with too much weight to move the wheels. Inevitably, the brand cornered the market with this car and made the luxury pony car a success. That was, until the second generation."

Instead, it appeared to be the alcoholic stepsister of the car that once held the throne at GM. This meant that the body was way more prominent than the previous model, and the engine options were reduced, eliminating the SS models from the lineup. In a matter of a decade, the Monte Carlo was transformed into a stereotypical grandpa's car, which remained until the fourth generation. The third generation was essentially a smaller version of the second generation, and it's hard to find anything else to say about it. So let's skip gen three and get right into generation four."

That was until the sixth-generation came back swinging with a redesign made to bring forth memories of The Intimidator, Dale Earnhardt, at the helm of the Nascar version. The SS was also available for this model with a supercharged V6; finally, the car returned with a V8 in 2006. This was the first time you could find these cars with a V8 engine making the front-wheel-drive coupe the second most influential car at chevy, behind the Corvette."
