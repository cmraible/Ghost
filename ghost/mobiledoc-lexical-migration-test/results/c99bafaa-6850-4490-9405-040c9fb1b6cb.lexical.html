<hr>
<p>Following the response to a prototype that was unveiled in the 1954 General Motors Motorama “Dream Cars” display, the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11166">Chevrolet Nomad</a> was introduced in 1955. Unlike the prototype, the new wagon was based off the A-body platform and shared the Tri-Five’s styling. At the upcoming 2021 Lakeland Winter Auction, Carlisle Auctions is giving enthusiasts the opportunity to own an example of what could possibly be the world's first sport wagon. This rare vintage <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11166">1955 Chevrolet Nomad</a> has undergone a full frame-off rotisserie restoration that ended with it being finished in a Custom Raspberry Red with a white top. All of the chrome and stainless parts have been brilliantly polished and the car is truly in show quality condition.</p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11166">Under the hood</a> is a highly detailed engine bay with an aluminum radiator and a 350-cid V8 engine centerpiece. It features an automatic transmission, power steering, 4-wheel power disc brakes, and a CPP steering box. The interior features a highly detailed dashboard with custom ivory-colored gauges and a two-tone tan-brown leather upholstery. Adding a touch of modern comfort and convenience, the vintage sport wagon is equipped with Vintage Air and a Classic Auto Sound stereo. Chrome Foose 5-spoke wheels wrapped in Nexen tires tie the vintage and modern styles perfectly, making this sports wagon a truly eye-catching car.</p>
