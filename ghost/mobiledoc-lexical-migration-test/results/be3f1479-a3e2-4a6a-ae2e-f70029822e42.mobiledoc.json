That employee was shot to death because he drove another employee to repossess a loaner Jeep Grand Cherokee a customer thought he could just keep as his own. We just can’t even begin to understand the vicious, entitled mentality of someone who would do such a thing."

He went back to the dealership for servicing and was given a Jeep Grand Cherokee as loaner so he could get around. This is a courtesy service many dealers offer these days so you’re not stuck bumming rides off your friends or hailing Ubers while your car’s in the shop."

The employee said Espy demanded the keys so the man complied, begged to not be shot, and got out of the Jeep."

Elhindawi was taken to the hospital but later died. Espy was initially charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and aggravated robbery, but Elhindawi’s death means he probably will be facing a capital murder charge. As for Massie, she’s facing a count of aggravated robbery."
