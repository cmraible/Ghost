Back on June 10, the owner of the pickup took it to the Kamloops Golf & Country Club in British Columbia, parking it while doing a round of golf. However, when he was done the Ford was nowhere to be found."

However, for every successfully recovered ride there are many more which either are never seen again or are found in pieces. Thankfully that wasn’t the end result in this case."
