And while Shawn Davis has covered any number of cool cars on the channel and undoubtedly sees many more in a given week, this Tri-Five is perhaps one of the most amazing yet. It took 8 years for the build to be completed and it’s obvious why when you see the level of attention paid to each detail."

Among the many things done are shaved door handles, cowls vents removed, handmade inner fenders fabricated, 3/4 inch of the roof chopped, and a one-piece machine aluminum grille made. The interior is even more dramatically redone with a tablet interface, burgundy leather, and details galore. Someone had a definite vision of how the car should look and it’s obvious meticulous planning was involved in the process. The end result is fabulous."
