<hr>
<p>If you like off-roading in <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48/">classic style</a>, it doesn’t get better than the original Ford Bronco. Even in stock trim, these trucks were some of the most capable vehicles out there. With the minimalist Jeep-like style but more power and more capacity, other makes just didn’t stand a chance in comparison. Despite being the best of the best, there’s always room for improvement especially when it comes to a vehicle with as much versatility and utility as the <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48/">Ford Bronco</a>.</p>

<p>Finished in a Limestone Green Metallic color, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1973-ford-bronco-48/">this example</a> is absolutely eye-catching. An untrained eye would likely miss that the rear fenders have been cut and bolt-on flares have been installed to accommodate the massive 35-inch x 12.5-inch tires wrapped around 15-inch Weld Racing wheels. A pin-on fiberglass cowl induction hood is another example of the subtle yet strong body modifications that make this example so beautiful. A Mile Marker winch, aftermarket bumpers, and a swing-away rear tire and Jerry can carrier finish off the look and the external utility features.</p>

<p>Inside is a continuation of the same school of thought that guided the exterior. Simple and utility oriented. Front bucket seats and rear bench seats are covered in black vinyl upholstery that matches the Tuffy center console while the dash is painted to match the body. With exception of a simple gauge cluster, heater controls and an AM radio are the only things mounted in the dash.</p>
