<p>When you buy a new <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31596/2017-ford-gt">Ford GT</a> you’re getting more than just a car. Along with incredible performance, a sleek body, and a ridiculous reputation for high speeds, you also receive the passion and history that comes with the cars racing past. What began as a way for Ford to beat Ferrari one on one, became one of the most prolific American supercars in auto racing history. <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31596/2017-ford-gt">The new GT</a> resembles its ancestors of endurance racing in many ways, aerodynamic styling, mid-engine design, low ride height, and a myriad of other Easter eggs that allude to the Le Mans dominating GT40. However, for some, the overall design cues that tell about the car’s past aren't enough.</p>
