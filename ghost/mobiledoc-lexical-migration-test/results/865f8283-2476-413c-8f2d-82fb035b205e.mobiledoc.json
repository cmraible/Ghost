That’s why it’s amazing to see this 1987 Buick Grand National with just 56 miles get rolled out of a garage for its first wash in 34 years. How someone avoided the temptation of hooning the hell out of the car is a mystery. Whatever the reason, this is might one of the most original out there. Considering not even 21,000 Grand Nationals were built for the 1987 model year, which was the biggest production run, it’s no wonder this is a prized find."

As is true with any real barn find, the Buick Grand National is absolutely filthy, hiding how well it’s been preserved. The car gets a full, professional detailing which leaves the exterior and interior absolutely sparkling. This car looks amazing and when it’s revealed to the owner the reaction is priceless."
