That’s what we get with this beautiful blue 1966 Chevrolet Corvette. After sitting partially disassembled for over 20 years, it was purchased by someone who had the time and patience to put it back together so it could finally hit the road again."

Reassembling the C2 Corvette and getting it running properly required skill and patience, but ultimately they brought the American sports car back to life, proving it was built to last for the long haul. Check out the video to see their work and the ’66 Corvette in action."
