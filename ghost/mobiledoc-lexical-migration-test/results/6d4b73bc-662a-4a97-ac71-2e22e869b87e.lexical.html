<p>When it comes to collectible Corvettes, it really doesn’t get any better than this example. This stunning <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1967-corvette-sting-ray">Rally Red 1967 Chevrolet Corvette</a> features its original numbers matching 390-horsepower 427-cid V8 engine paired to its numbers matching Muncie 4-speed manual transmission and its date correct 3.55 positraction rear end. Corroborating the cars pedigree is its original tank sticker and options include a matching auxiliary hardtop, a side mount chambered exhaust, power steering, power 4-wheel disc brakes, and power windows. While this Corvette would make an excellent centerpiece to nearly any collection, some enthusiasts might prefer the styling of the roadster that inspired <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1967-corvette-sting-ray">Chevy to step up </a>its power game for the mid-year Corvette instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/backdraft-rt4-cobra">This Backdraft Roadster</a> takes the styling of the 1960s roadster and refines it with decades of race proven, high performance technology. Down to the Guardsman Blue finish, Wimbledon White stripe, and stainless steel side exhaust pipes, visually this roadster is all ‘60s. But underneath a modern independent suspension provides the ultimate in driveability and handling while a Roush 427SRX V8 engine paired with a Tremec TKO 5-speed manual transmission offers a modern feeling 480-horsepower.</p>
