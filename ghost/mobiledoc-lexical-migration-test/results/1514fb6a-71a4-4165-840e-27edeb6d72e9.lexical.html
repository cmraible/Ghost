<p>Back in January were covered the story of a 1967 Shelby GT500 stolen in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Then in February the classic muscle car was recovered, only with much of the bodywork and other parts missing. Buried under some bushes with blankets covering the vehicle up, the thieves obviously did an amateur job. Now, the guy who’s accused of masterminding this heist has reportedly skipped town instead of making his court appearance, meaning law enforcement needs your help getting him back into custody.</p>

<p>We really hate car thieves. It’s even worse when they steal something so beautiful and rare, then hack off some parts and dump the vehicle like it’s a dead goat. That’s why we really want to see Nicholas Chamberlain face the music instead of ducking responsibility. Instead of showing up to a court hearing in June, he skipped town and now has a bench warrant out for his arrest.</p>

<p>Not only are Tulsa Police on the hunt for Chamberlain, they’re looking for his father and his father’s wife, Roy and Tony Morris. All three were charged by the Tulsa County District Attorney’s Office for the crime, with Chamberlain appearing before a judge later the same month.</p>

<p>An arrest warrant was issued for the Morris’ as well, but the husband and wife never turned themselves in, according to authorities. Tulsa Police believe they’ve fled the area, possibly going to another state to escape the consequences which could be coming through the court.</p>

<p>However, in early June Chamberlain pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him. Instead of showing up at a preliminary hearing later in the month, the man just disappeared. Police are asking for the public’s help in tracking all three people down so they can have their day in court. If you know anything about where they might be, do the right thing and contact police. Desecrating such a beautiful classic car should have consequences, otherwise it’s just going to happen again.</p>
