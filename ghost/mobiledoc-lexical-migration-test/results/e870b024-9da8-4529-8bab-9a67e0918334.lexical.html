<p>The early days of the pandemic felt like a cessation of the normal human hostilities. Local communities pulled together, <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/covid19-lockdowns-democracy/">trust in leaders rose</a>, and we came together as a species. </p>
<p>It couldn't last, could it? </p>
<p>First, they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/18/deep-conspiracy-roots-europe-wave-cell-tower-fires-264997">started burning 5G towers</a>. And then the latest wave of vaccine conspiracy theories started. We touched yesterday on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/06/niches-networks-and-the-secrets-of-tiktok-revealed/">power of social media to help people self-organise</a>, both for good and ill. Well, here's another example. After an early stage of the COVID-19 crisis, where the anti-vaxxers seemed to go quiet, a narrative has slowly been building that the the whole thing is a conspiracy (of course) to <em>create</em> a need for a vaccine, that will be used to control us.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53061563">Bill Gates is behind it all</a>. </p>
<p>Right. </p>
<h3 id="fighting-decentralised-narratives-with-centralised-tools">Fighting decentralised narratives with centralised tools</h3>
<p>The problem with this is that we're trying to counter a highly-decentralised narrative with centralising tools - like mainstream publications. But a well-wrtten article that debunks a conspiracy theory does little to counter the organic, spreading narrative transmitting through Facebook groups. </p>
<p>One organisation - the <a href="https://publicgoodprojects.org">Public Good Projects</a> - is attempting to vaccinate the internet against this, by harnessing a distributed group of individuals, as <em>WIRED</em> reports:</p>
<blockquote>To do so, [Public Good Projects] plans to conscript the vast but largely silent majority of Americans who support vaccines into any army of keyboard warriors trained to block, hide, and report vaccine misinformation. (According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/276929/fewer-continue-vaccines-important.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">a recent Gallup poll</a>, 84 percent of Americans say vaccinating children is important.)</blockquote>
<p>Fascinating. </p>
<p>Admirable though this is, I can't help but think that the need for this is a failure of journalism. By failing to adapt ourselves fully to the decentralised, network age, we're allowing this misinformation to establish itself in the body of national and international politics. </p>
<p>The question remains: how do we adapt journalism so journalistic reporting is better able to act as an information immune system in a decentralised inofmration ecosystem? </p>

<p>Just in case you haven't had enough of misinformation, here's another dose for you. </p>
<p>Wellness is a pretty innocuous form for Instagram influencers, right? It's not lkley to be a vector for misinformation, surely? </p>
<p>Well, uh…</p>
<blockquote>Yet in its tone, wellness Instagram still retains some of its original scepticism of the medical establishment. And while some influencers may believe they are genuine truth tellers, the platform's architecture rewards more extreme and emotive content with followers and engagement.</blockquote>
<p>Just as well there's no major public health crisis that could make this a real problem, isn't it? </p>
