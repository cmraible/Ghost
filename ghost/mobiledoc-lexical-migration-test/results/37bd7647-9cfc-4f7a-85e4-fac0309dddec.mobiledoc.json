This particular car (chassis LC1-002) won the grueling Nürburgring 1000km race that year, and today it wears the same no. 50 as it did in its sole victory. Due to rule changes, the LC1 was retired – replaced by the Lancia LC2 – after just one year of racing, and even in private hands, this car went on to compete in hill climbs and road course races."
