<p>It's a busy week, so let's stay true to the mission, cut the waffle, and get down to the links…</p>
<h2 id="seo">SEO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>🛒 Google clearly feeling some pressure and trying to <a href="https://www.nearmedia.co/does-the-gmb-rebranding-mean-more-or-less-than-google-say/">recruit small businesses to defend it</a>…</li>
    <li>👨🏼‍⚖️ Google wins a court case on privacy. <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/google-vs-lloyd-uk-needs-collective-redress/">The Open Rights Group is not impressed</a>.</li>
    <li>🗂 And it might end up <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-is-testing-the-indexnow-protocol-for-sustainability-375932">supporting IndexNow</a>, a system for letting search engines know that there’s something new to index, which is used by Bing and Yandex. Shades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubub</a> here.</li>

<h2 id="instagram">Instagram</h2>

    <li>🌐 Twitter Blue is here — if your here is the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.</li>

<ul>
    <li>✍🏽 <em>Vox</em> is <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/11/vox-is-revamping-its-editorial-strategy-to-redefine-what-voxxy-means/">refining and refocusing its strategy</a>. This is fascinating — it feels like a title that has, naturally, become a little wooly on its focus over time, setting some clear strategy about what’s next for it. It’s all in the execution, though…</li>
    <li>🤬 <em>The Verge</em> has had it with tech <a href="https://www.theverge.com/press-room/22772113/the-verge-on-background-policy-update">off-the-record background briefings</a>.</li>

<ul>
    <li>🦄 OpenWeb, a comments and community platform, <a href="https://www.axios.com/nytimes-openweb-tech-unicorn-0a55d6ae-79e5-43f9-a050-55fe2f1b3ffc.html?utm_campaign=UA-39227834-1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">hits tech unicorn status</a>.

Some people in social media circles are upset by this, but I think it’s the right call. They’ve been over-weaponised for political and culture war purposes. Defensive design is necessary on social platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h2>
<ul>
    <li>📧 We haven’t <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/11/03/we-havent-reached-peak-newsletter-not-by-a-long-shot-519207">reached peak newsletter yet</a>. (Did people ever talk about peak magazine or peak newspaper?)</li>

<p>This is an important story to me personally. The hotel that burned down was the place I was staying with my now-wife the weekend I proposed to her. But it’s also good to see organisations reflecting on coverage after the event.</p>
