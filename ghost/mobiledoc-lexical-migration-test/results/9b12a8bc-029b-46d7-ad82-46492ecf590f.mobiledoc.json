          "As predicted, Millsap didn‚Äôt come quietly. At some point a police K-9 was released on the man and officers opened fire. Millsap was shot, although police declined to give details about how many times he was hit or where. The man was transported to a hospital where he died of his injuries, just like East. The police K-9 was also shot, but the wound was non-threatening."
