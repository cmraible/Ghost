          "Obviously, Peterson really likes these old trucks since he has two successive model years. This one, “Pokie,” has been painted to look like it sat outside for a long time. It also has a new 454 Big Block V8 and some other mods."

          "We can praise Peterson for being practical, but his second car purchase was a little more extravagant. He bought a BMW 650i for his then-girlfriend who’s now his wife. We can’t endorse a move like that as a good courtship practice, but it seems to have worked out for him."
