<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at Maxime Bernard's <em>Wild Dose</em>. The game is slated to release in Q2 2022 on Windows PC (via Steam), Xbox One Q3/Q4 2022, Xbox Q1 2023 and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>Here's the overview:</p>
<blockquote>Wild Dose is a first-person adventure game which takes place between a cyberpunk city and virtual wild environments, until you start to mix both worlds. Currently being developed for PC (Windows), with your help Wild Dose can also be released on Mac, Linux, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.<br><br>The future, tomorrow... Earth has become a giant city, private corporations have replaced governments and public services. To escape from this urban hell, people seek refuge in legal cyberdrugs, delivered directly from networks to their neural implants. Hackers also deal illegal versions of these drugs. The deadliest one is called Wild Dose.<br><br>You are one of these many cyberjunkies. Walk the slums of Eleftheria, discover the stories of its citizens, follow the rules or rebel against the system. Fulfill private contracts or execute tasks for your fellow citizens to buy your next dose.<br><br>Get away in a comforting digital environment. Let your AI Nora guide you 00and choose to build a strong relationship with her. Or explore Wild Dose with the Capetian, the mysterious creator of that drug. He will teach you how to survive in this dangerous rule-changing universe. Evolve in virtual landscapes that look always more convincing, while the real world seems less tangible, until the distinction between both becomes a blur.<br><br>In this divided society from which you are trying to escape, you will have only one certainty: taking part in Wild Dose is taking part in a real revolution...</blockquote>
