One of those is the Brighton Speed Trials which have been held on Madeira Drive in Brighton since 1905. There’s a really great story about how Sir Harry Preston was able to persuade the town council into tarmacking the road as a way to attract automotive events, a strategy which worked brilliantly. Too bad Preston isn’t still around, because he might have foreseen the latest “safety” improvements applied to the road have made it "

          "Vintage Motor Cycle Club helped break the bad news in a Facebook post on August 20, announcing motorcycles won’t be taking part in the annual event, which wasn’t held last year. After an Auto-Cycle Union inspection of the track, it was determined a track certificate and permit couldn’t be issued. Among the reasons why were the cycling lanes painted green and pedestrian crossings painted red, plus “projections which have been moved during recent works… (which) are a cause for concern.”"

I’ve seen this in US cities as well, supposedly as a way to make streets safer. And I’ve also heard of the paint becoming slick in the rain, making these zones less safe for everyone. While it wasn’t disclosed that was a concern, I wouldn’t be surprised if the slickness of the painted surfaces is an issue."

Would it be safe for cyclists and pedestrians? There are many questions here and few answers. Part of me wonders if the lack of exposition on the details of why the track was deemed unsafe for motorcycle racing isn’t intentional. After all, citizens might have questions and demand changes be made to the road."
