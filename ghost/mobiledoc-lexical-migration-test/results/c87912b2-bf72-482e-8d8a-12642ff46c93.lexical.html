<p>While the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/303616/only-left-hand-drive-rx7">FD RX-7s</a> get all the attention these days, like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1993-toyota-supra-turbo-auction-meets-expectations/">Mk IV Supras</a>, this 1988 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mazda/RX-7">Mazda RX-7</a>Turbo II 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary is certainly a beautiful <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a>. Its owner, Sean Lee, obviously has taken excellent care of it and has plenty of pride in driving the rotary-powered classic.</p>
<p>The story behind this classic <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mazda">Mazda</a> is pretty amazing. Basically, the previous owner bought it on a whim while grabbing a new Mazda B3000 as a work vehicle for his farm. Apparently wanting to keep the sports car nice, he parked the RX-7 in his basement. It sat there for 25 years, accumulating just 1,200 miles until Lee found out about this “basement find” car and was able to work out a purchase agreement. Evidently, it was <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/393878/paul-walkers-1989-nissan-skyline/">Paul Walker’s</a> brother who initially uncovered this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dave-mustaines-car-collection/">Mazda</a> because he married the granddaughter of the original owner.</p>
<p>Rotary <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/politicians-stick-car-enthusiasts/">car enthusiasts</a> are definitely their own breed. That’s not all good and not all bad, just they march to the beat of a different drummer. So, it shouldn’t be surprising to see a second-gen Mazda RX-7 all done up with pretty much everything white on the exterior. But that aesthetic totally works here.</p>
<p>The only white thing this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/5-missing-car-mysteries/">car is missing</a> might be whitewall tires – those wouldn’t be period-correct, otherwise it would probably be rolling on a set. The badges, louvres, and wheels are all white, matching the paint. It’s definitely a tribute to an aesthetic which is now considered retro.</p>

<p>Lee’s garage has some pretty amazing vehicles in it, including a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Nissan/GT-R">Nissan GT-R</a> and a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjkxMSJdfQ==">Porsche 911</a> GT3. While some would wonder why the guy even bother with an ’88 Mazda RX-7, those who really understand rotaries don’t even need to ask why. Let’s just say it’s like comparing apples and oranges: they’re just different.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Sean Lee’s <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/397316/car-filled-man-cave/">man cave</a> garage reflects some of his other interests, like comic books and Hot Wheels. Considering he must spend a considerable amount of time in there doing cosmetic mods to his cars, it makes sense why the place would be so nice.</p>
