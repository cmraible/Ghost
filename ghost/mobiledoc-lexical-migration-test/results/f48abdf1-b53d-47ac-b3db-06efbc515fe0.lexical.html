Through the decades, this brand has grown from a small-time manufacturer of sports cars to one of the biggest auto manufacturers today. Currently selling for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars, the modern examples rolling off the factory floors are pretty insane in their own right. However, some of us tend to find our eyes wandering to the classic cars that made the German manufacturer so admired in the first place.</p>

Of course, the best part is that it was made in 1936 which is insane to think about when you see how good of condition the vehicle is in. Under the hood, you'll find an engine that you might not expect in such an aged automobile. Utilizing 4.0-liters of displacement, this incredible straight-eight engine is a stark contrast to the high displacement inline-sixes that were shaping the American sector. All of this is well and good but you might be wondering how much power the car actually makes.</p>

<p>In total the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/sm22/st--moritz/lots/r0009-1936-bugatti-type-57s-atalante/1278685?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=SM22">horsepower</a> output of this engine comes out to a staggering 200 horsepower which is nearly double what some might expect from a sports car made in that time. With such a massive figure, you wouldn't be out of place asking how it's capable of such impressive performance. The answer to that is that it is supercharged making it sounds and drives like nothing else around at the time. With all of this in mind, this is one of the best automobiles to come from the early years of automotive production.</p>
