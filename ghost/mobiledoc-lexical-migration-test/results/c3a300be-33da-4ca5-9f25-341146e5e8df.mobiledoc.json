As in countless other cases, the person who legally filmed the police was arrested. Teenager Peter Colon, shot at point-blank range in the back by NYPD Officer Danny Acosta, was accused of holding a gun to an officer’s head (he didn’t). District attorneys vacated hundreds of convictions in 2021 after longtime NYPD narcotics cop Joseph Franco was caught framing someone on camera. Franco was previously accused of framing his victims, but it was his word against theirs. Facing lengthy sentences, they pled guilty.”"

The college has become a leading force in promoting a conservative and overtly Christian reading of American history and the U.S. Constitution. It opposes progressive education reforms in general and contemporary scholarship on inequality in particular. It has featured lectures describing the Jan. 6 insurrection as a hoax and Vladimir Putin as a ‘hero to populist conservatives around the world.’” "

More than half of these were contaminated with antibiotic-resistant strains, a rapidly escalating issue that can be exacerbated by poor hygiene conditions. The poultry companies supply major grocery stores and fast-food chains. Tyson has supplied chicken to McDonald’s, Perdue has sold to Whole Foods, and both have supplied Walmart.”"
