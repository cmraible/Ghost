<p>This Stingray was found on Copart after being vandalized with white paint. It only has 7,485 miles on the clock, and so much life left to live. Corvette Blogger speculates that the Trump bumper sticker on the rear could have caused the Corvette to become a target. </p>

<p>While not covered in sprayed with windows taken out with a bat, we'll count this rare Bimmer since it was crashed after being stolen. It was also found abandoned after the crash near a group of rioters, so something very nafarious went down here. </p>

<p>This Camaro was part of a 36 car crime spree when it got its window based in back oin 2017. What's even more infuriating is, the car's owner points out that vandalism like this is only a misdemeanor. </p>
