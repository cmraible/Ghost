<hr>
<p>It’s always interesting to see when <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bouncy-house-car-collection/">someone is financially successful</a> but isn’t a big time celebrity, yet still is a complete <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/instead-of-a-vacation/">gearhead</a>, what kinds of cars they amass over a lifetime of collecting. We have a pretty impressive display from the late Dick Pellow, a man who built a towing empire and much more in St. Paul, Minnesota. Most of his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/massive-collection/">car collection</a> is crossing the auction block this Saturday, so if you’ve been looking for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/750-horsepower-1969-boss-hemi/">something unique</a>, this might be your ticket.</p>

<p>One of the more notable vehicles is a 1936 Hudson Terraplane Custom 6 Convertible, 1 of 6 known to be in existence. The cream yellow car with its tan convertible soft top, plus a rich brown leather interior, all looks absolutely fabulous since only 6 miles have been accumulated since a full restoration.</p>

<p>Another interesting car among the many being auctioned is a 1911 Krit Model A runabout. Few people today have seen a Krit and for good reason considering the automaker only lasted from 1909 to 1916, so taking this to any <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/rarest-and-most-expensive-cars-ever/">classic car</a> gathering will generate a lot of talk. The bright green paint job, white accents, and the white leather interior show incredibly well.</p>

<p>Pellow collected quite a few Fords, which will be up for bidding, including a 1928 Ford Model AA Popcorn Truck. After seeing one like it, the man used his own Ford Model AA truck chassis to create a mobile popcorn sales station, complete with classic signage, custom stained glass, and stainless accents.</p>
<p>There are many more cars included in the auction as well as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/former-airstrip-car-collection/">automobilia</a> items like hood ornaments, oil cans, service station signs, and gas pump lobes.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the Pellow Collection will be crossing the auction block on Saturday, June 26 with VanDerBrink Auctions. Check out the full lot listing <a href="https://www.vanderbrinkauctions.com/catalog/?auction=10274">here</a>.</p>
