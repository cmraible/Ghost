The Sierra was the four-door station wagon version of the Dodge's Royal lineup, and it featured extravagant body work and big tail fins. The car you see here is an incredible example of these wagons with a beautiful two-tone paint that is complemented by lots of chrome and wire wheels wrapped in white-wall tires."

If not for the aftermarket stereo (mounted under the dash) and the speaker box in the cargo area, this Dodge Sierra would look as fresh as it did the day it was built. Under the hood, Dodge's 361 cubic-inch V8 provides plenty of power, and the push-button transmission adds a futuristic touch to this cabin."
