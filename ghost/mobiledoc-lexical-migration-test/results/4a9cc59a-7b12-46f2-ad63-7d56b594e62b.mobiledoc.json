Earlier in 2020 a 1969 Holden Monaro race car auctioned for a lofty $715,000, wowing observers and enthusiasts. That no doubt helped fuel speculation that John Harvey’s former car would hit 7 digits. However, back in 2018 Peter Brock’s Holden VH Commodore which he used in 1982 and 1983 to win Bathurst hammered for $2.1 million, thanks to a hardcore and well-heeled motorsports enthusiast."
