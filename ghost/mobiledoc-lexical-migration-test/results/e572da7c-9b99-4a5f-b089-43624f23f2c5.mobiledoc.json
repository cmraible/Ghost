Leaving aside its seven decades of top-level motorsport victories, Ferrari has a stable of road car legends stretching right back to the 1940s. To be so consistently excellent, to have created a brand with such global dominance and to show no signs of slowing down – Ferrari is the very definition of automotive greatness, and we’re delighted to be showcasing some of its best work at the London Concours.”"
