<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">The V-Series</a> was introduced in 2004 with the CTS-V, a luxury car that had a focus on performance. From the very beginning the idea was very simple. Take the luxurious and underpowered <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">CTS and fit it with a drivetrain</a> inspired by the top-of-the-line Corvette. This garnered a lot of new attention to the brand, especially from the younger crowd. </p>

<p>V-Series successes also led to Cadillac’s eventual return to the American endurance racing circuit and in 2016 it debuted its entry in the 2017 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship which went on to win the 24-Hours Of Daytona later that year. To celebrate its victorious return to the racetrack, Cadillac turned to the car that started it all and unveiled a <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">limited edition CTS-V</a> Championship Edition. Less than a few hundred examples were made and finishes were limited to just two colors, of which only 86 were finished in Crystal White Tricoat.</p>
