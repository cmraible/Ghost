<p>Only the very biggest titles have any realistic chance of playing across the majority of these points in the arc. And that’s where choices come into play - which tools are best for the audience you want to reach? Are they hungry, edge-of-the-seat news consumers? Or are they lean-back, in-depth readers? Are they going to enjoy rich, multimedia features, or so they just want a 60-second explainer video, or a 250 word inverted pyramid job?</p>
<p>Getting that right is the essence of content strategy. Hopefully, you now have enough of an understanding to start making some smart decisions about where you should play - and I strongly recommend using analytics to test and learn from those experiments.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: the answers online are more diverse than they are in print - and it’s up to you to figure out what <em>your</em> readers want.</p>
