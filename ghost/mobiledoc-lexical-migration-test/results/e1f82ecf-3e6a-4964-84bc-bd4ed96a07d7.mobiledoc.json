The Corvette Torch Red paint, white stripes, and chrome treatments all appear as close to flawless as pretty much anyone could expect. Fiberglass hood scoops and a trunk-lid spoiler add some interesting flair, among other details like billet hood hinges and a hideaway car cover compartment in the trunk. The interior, under the hood, and the trunk all show exceptionally well. Someone really paid attention to every small detail with this car. You could take it to a show and impress quite a few people, including judges."
