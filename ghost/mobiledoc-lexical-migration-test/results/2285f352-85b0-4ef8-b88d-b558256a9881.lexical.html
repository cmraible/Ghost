<p>Kevin Hart has impeccable taste in cars, especially muscle cars, with an affinity for Dodge muscle car, specially old school Dodge muscle cars. The comedian first became a subject of Motorious coverage back a few years ago when he gifted his touring entourage their favorite collectible cars, and went on to captivate our readers with his saga of the 1970 'Cuda, known as "Menace", both when he bought it, when someone else wrecked it while he was in the passenger seat, and the chaos that unfolded. Now, Kevin Hart has embarked on a new automotive journey behind the wheel of a 1000-horspower 1970 Dodge Charger.</p>

<p>SpeedKore built the full carbon fiber body Mopar muscle car, dubbed "Hellraiser", with a 7.0-liter Hellephant enigne as the show stopper of the build. The supercharged engine produces 1,000-hp and 950 lbs-ft of torque, which feeds into a Dodge Demon spec'ed ZF eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>The aggressive classic muscle car rides on a C6 Corvette style suspension, with upgrades from Detroit Speed and Woodward at the front, and a unique SpeedKore fabricated four-bar suspension with Penske double-adjustable shocks taking duty at the back - with front and rear sway bars further helping with body roll and handling. Stopping power comes from Brembo brakes, and the impressive Dodge muscle car rolls on a set of HRE S201 3-piece wheels, wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires.</p>

<p>On the inside are red and black Recaro seats with hardness seat-belts, for extra security, and the Charger also has an integrated roll cage. We hope this head-turning Mopar muscle car has a better fate than the last - it's one helluva machine!</p>
