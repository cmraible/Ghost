Among other pieces in the collection, David Dayen argues for a common-sense solution to the turmoil: “You solve that only by rebuilding redundancy and resiliency. That means taking down the policy tyrannies that have forced reliance on faraway manufacturing plants, self-interested ocean shipping oligopolies, overwhelmed ports, deregulated trucking and rail systems, and retail giants and middlemen that see these cumulative problems as an opportunity to raise prices well above increased input costs. It means viewing the system as an engineer would, redesigning it for sustainability and strength rather than profit.”"

Private equity is now the dominant form of financial backing among the 35 largest owners of multifamily buildings, the analysis showed. In 2011, about a third of the apartment units held by the top owners were backed by private equity. A decade later, half of them were… Private equity firms often act like a corporate version of a house flipper: They seek deals on apartment buildings, slash costs or hike rents to boost income, then unload the buildings at a higher price."

And I have to pay hundreds of dollars — a steal — to keep it functioning each month. I turned 26 nearly two years ago, and have navigated the impossibly complicated world of health insurance on my own since then. It is no understatement to say it has influenced every life decision I have made since.”"

Well into her 50s, she’s eclipsed the normal lifespan of an orca in the wild — and long since surpassed the life expectancy of one captured. As they await her fate, a band of whale fanatics in Washington — scientists, capture converts, and spiritual relatives — have advanced an ambitious plan to bring her back to the Salish Sea. They could have come together much sooner.”"

The other thing you realize is that you have a history. Your history didn’t start on the shores of the United States. It didn’t start with slavery. Your history started [in] Africa at the beginning of time, the beginning of civilization.’”"
