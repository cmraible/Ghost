What’s more, that representative says they have no idea who requested the car be towed, only saying the muscle car broke down and had to be pushed onto the dealership lot."

Who’s right? Well, we’d love to believe towing services don’t just take cars because someone says it’s theirs, otherwise they might be aiding in the theft of a vehicle. Exactly what legal ramifications a company would face for that is a good question for a local attorney to answer."
