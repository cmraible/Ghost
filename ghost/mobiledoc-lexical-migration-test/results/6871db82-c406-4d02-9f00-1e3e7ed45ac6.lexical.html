<p>In one fell swoop, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-dead-mans-classic-cars/">thieves stole the classic cars</a> and bicycles it took Bob Underwood 30 years of sacrifice to gather. The man says <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/thousands-of-barn-find-bikes/">all those vehicles</a> together are worth about a quarter of a million dollars, so no doubt the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-2-classic-fords/">criminals are celebrating</a>. Gone are his plans to restore or sell them, so now he’s out his rightful property and may never see it again. Now the Cleveland, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/muscle-car-drivers-running/">Oklahoma</a> man has to figure out what to do next.</p>
<blockquote><em>Another classic car theft story has an updated happy ending you can read <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-2-classic-fords/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Stored on Underwood’s property was a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-chevrolet-nova/">1968 Chevrolet Nova</a>, a 1971 Dodge pickup, 4 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">classic Ford Mustangs</a>, plus dozens of antique bicycles. We can appreciate this man liked all three of the Big Three automakers, but now he’s left without any of those classic cars.</p>
<p>As Underwood noted, to haul all that away obviously took the thieves several trips. It’s possible the work of thievery was done over the course of several days or nights, so someone had to have seen something.</p>
<p>So far, Pawnee County investigators have tracked down 2 people they believe were involved in the theft. However, none of the classic cars or bicycles have been recovered.</p>
<p>It would seem the thieves either knew Underwood or had been monitoring his house, waiting for the perfect time to strike. He and his wife went out of town for an anniversary trip for several weeks, giving the criminals plenty of time to move all the goods.</p>
<p>"I mean this stuff was junk to most people, but it was priceless to me," said Underwood. He explained to journalists that even with all the kind words people have shared with him, it’s hard to keep going.</p>
<p>While this situation is sad, there are some solid takeaways everyone can learn here. If you’re going to leave town, having someone check up on your place regularly is a good idea. Also, install security cameras which alert you when motion is detected. Yes, that might not be ideal when you’re trying to relax on a secluded beach thousands of miles away, but it could save you from heartbreak and even more stress later.</p>
