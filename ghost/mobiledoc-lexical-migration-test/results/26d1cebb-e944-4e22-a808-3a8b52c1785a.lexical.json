A further assessment under the hood revealed two tiny chips in the black paint in the upper cowl that showed more blue under the black paint. Looking inside the car, I saw a nearly completely restored and beautiful interior, but quickly noticed that both sun visors and both lower front kick panels had formerly been blue originally and had been re-dyed black to match the rest of the interior.

A correct VIN got me everything else I needed- 2 auction sales in the past few years at different auction houses, with both auction houses declining to represent it as a real RS, or as numbers matching. Both auction sales brought less than half the current asking price (which was almost $60,000) for this wolf in sheep’s clothing.
