Considering they’ve become a favorite target of thieves in the past three years or so, it’s a fair question. Surely they’re losing a good chunk of money when these cars are stolen? Or is the insurance covering everything? But wouldn’t this widespread problem lead to higher insurance rates?"

Of course that opens up a whole new risk of the person who transports the keys getting held up, or wherever you keep the keys overnight becoming a target of thieves. After all, car thieves have become rather aggressive and seem to face few consequences for their actions in a lot of areas, so it’s no wonder why."
