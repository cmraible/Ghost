The end result is the V8 is pumping out 1,025-horsepower and 945 lb.-ft. of torque when the car is running on E85 fuel. Thanks to all kinds of trickery, Dodge says the Demon 170 will run an 8-second quarter mile without modifications."

The only problem is affording one, what with dealers gouging like we haven’t seen since the Shelby GT500 was released."
