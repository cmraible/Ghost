However, not everyone in the region is happy with their purchase over the long run. Take, for example, this guy from Finland who recently blew up his Tesla Model S using 30 kg of dynamite, making for one fine explosion."

After having a tow truck take the Model S to a Tesla service center, the man waited a month until he finally received a verdict: the entire battery cell needed to be swapped out. The cost of such an operation was a whopping 20,000+€ (that’s about $22,000 USD)."

In other words, he could spend all that money and still have one technologically advanced paperweight. That’s when the guy decided to just blow the car up because that’s just the only logical conclusion or something."

That can’t be good for the environment, which brings up the question of just what will happen to all these electric cars when they finally give up the ghost. Sure, they won’t be blown up like this, but will they just sit in a field and smolder? Will the old batteries leak into the ground water?"

They purposely loaded all the dynamite on one side of the Tesla so they controlled the direction of the blast. All that debris went flying at the rock wall, but just to be on the safe side everyone observing it were gathered in a shelter. What’s more, it was performed in a rural area away from civilization at an old rock quarry, ensuring no innocents happened upon the scene at the wrong moment. In other words, don’t try to replicate this stunt unless you’re an explosives expert."
