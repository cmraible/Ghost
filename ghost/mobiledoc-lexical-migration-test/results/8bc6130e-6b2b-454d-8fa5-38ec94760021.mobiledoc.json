The good news is it’s a California car and there apparently is no rust plus the paint is original, so that’s a big plus. There are also zero accidents and the frame is advertised as straight. Also, it has the 5-speed manual transmission, another positive. What’s more, this Porsche comes with all the original tools, manuals, jack, and spare tire. That might sound like a silly thing to get excited about for those who don’t know, but if you have experience with vintage cars like this you know just what a big deal that is."

A new Bosch battery is being thrown in for good measure, but the seller warns the old fuel needs to be drained and a new fuel filter is needed."
