<hr>
<p>Police in Olathe, Kansas recovered a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1977-chevrolet-camaro/">1977 Chevrolet Camaro</a> submerged in Lake Olathe, finally removing the muscle car out of its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/divers-40-cars-tennessee/">watery grave</a>. There’s always considerable speculation about why any vehicle would be found at the bottom of a lake or any body of water. Instead of some private citizens like YouTubers Adventure With Purpose locating the car, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/missing-1987-chevy-camaro-pulled-from-reservoir/">Camaro was discovered</a> during a joint training exercise between the Olathe Fire Department and the Garmin Marine Division back in the spring.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, it seems the American muscle car was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/interesting-cars-found-underwater/">submerged in the murky waters</a> for “an extended period of time” according to an Olathe Police Department media release. An investigation to determine how the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaros-georgia-state-patrol/">Camaro</a> ended up in the lake and why began.</p>
<p>There seems to be a magnetic attraction between Camaros and water, like this phenomenon between <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/another-mustang-power-pole/">Mustangs and power poles</a>.

<p>Shortly after pulling the black Chevy Camaro from the lake, police announced a break in the case. Apparently, the car had been reported as stolen back in 1977. We’ll let you, the reader, draw your own conclusions about that. The truly bizarre part is that in 1981 the vehicle was reported as recovered, or in other words it was removed from the police department’s system as a stolen car. An update to the original release says, “there is not an active criminal investigation involving the vehicle at this time.”</p>
<p>Obviously, there are details missing. Something happened after the car was recovered in 1981 and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Olathe. So why has the criminal investigation not active? Police did clarify, saying the statute of limitations has passed for property crime, so there’s no sense in continuing the investigation.</p>
