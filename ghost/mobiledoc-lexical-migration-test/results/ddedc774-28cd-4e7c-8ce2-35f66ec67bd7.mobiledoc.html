<hr>
<p>Most <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/tour-some-virtual-auto-museums/">car museums</a> work hard to make their display vehicles looking as pristine and complete as possible, but a new exhibit at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum is doing something a little different to give visitors a different perspective on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-adam-carolla-check-out-ken-miles-ford-gt40/">Ford GT40</a>. The new exhibit is called "Overexposed," and it features a pair of GT40s (a '66 MkII and a '67 MkIV) partially disassembled showing the finer details this iconic American <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/racing/">racecar</a>.</p>

<p>While it was nothing for a race team to see one of these GT40s in such a state of undress, the two cars stripped of their hoods, doors and engine covers offer a unique perspective of the components and technology that make up these incredible machines. Whether or not you're able to see these cars in person, the museum has released a pair of videos for this exhibit. One is a walk-around teaser video giving an up-close look at both cars, while the other video is a compilation of images and footage of various GT40s being developed and raced.</p>
<p>These cars aren't just reproductions either as both have racing provenance. The <a href="https://simeonemuseum.org/collection/1966-ford-gt40-mkii/">yellow no. 8 Ford GT40 MKII</a> had raced at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans by the Alan Mann Racing team, but unlike the successful Ford teams that finished first, second and third, this car was retired due a clutch failure just six hours into the race. A year later, the blue Holman & Moody <a href="https://simeonemuseum.org/collection/1967-ford-gt40-mk-iv/">no. 4 Ford GT40 MKIV</a> was racing at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans where it set a top speed record of over 224 mph before being involved in a crash after just eight hours.</p>

<p>The "Overexposed" exhibit opened on August 21st, and there is currently no specified end date. If your travels take you to Philadelphia anytime soon, this is definitely a must-see for any car lover.</p>
