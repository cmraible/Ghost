<hr>
<p>Dodge has upped their game tremendously in the performance car department with their Hellcat lineup. Boasting an insane 1,100-horsepower, this Dodge Challenger Hellcat Wide-body is ready to smoke any high-performance Mustang, Corvette, and Camaro thrown its way. Actually, it's ready to throw down against pretty much anything with that much horsepower on tap. This performance powerhouse is ready for a place to call home thanks to Speed Society and their 25th automotive enthusiast sweepstakes. A purchase <a href="https://store.speedsociety.com/sweepstakes/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=25_redeye&utm_term=yahoo&utm_content=redeye_sscc_article_1">from the Speed Society</a> store will enter you into the sweepstakes, and every $5 spent will gain you 1 automatic entry into the sweepstakes. Another way to enter is to become a <a href="https://store.speedsociety.com/sweepstakes/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=25_redeye&utm_term=yahoo&utm_content=redeye_sscc_article_1">Speed Society Car Club Member</a> where you will receive automatic monthly entries into every sweepstakes plus member benefits, exclusive merchandise, discounts and value.</p>

<p>incredible slice of modern American muscle. The winner gets to choose whether they want to <a href="https://store.speedsociety.com/sweepstakes/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=25_redeye&utm_term=yahoo&utm_content=redeye_sscc_article_1">take home the Redeye Hellcat</a> or $50,000 cash instead. The sweepstakes ends on September 8th at midnight, so go ahead and make that purchase now to be entered to win.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.speedsociety.com/sweepstakes/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=25_redeye&utm_term=yahoo&utm_content=redeye_sscc_article_1">The Speed Society team</a> created a poll to ask fans what car they should give away to one lucky winner. The answer was the Redeye. After scoping out dealerships across the country, they got their hands on a brand new 2019 Redeye Hellcat Wide-body finished in Destroyer Gray, a name that couldn't be more fitting for this modern Mopar. </p>

<p>Speed Society had Forza Tuning's Brenton Brown fly out to their headquarters in San Diego to start working his magic to turn this already-powerful car into the ultimate performance machine. "The goal was to create the most powerful and reliable Hellcat on the road," according to Speed Society. Off the assembly line, the '19 Hellcat Redeye Challenger already comes equipped with supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine and generates 797-horsepower and 707 lb/ft of torque to the pavement. </p>
<p>On a mission to fix the shortcomings of the modern powerhouse such as the stock platform, engine, supercharger, suspension and rear end, Brenton went to work to tap into the car's utmost potential. Brenton added Forza's 1100-hp 4R package to ensure that this Hellcat-powered Redeye Challenger will feature asphalt-stomping power. </p>
<p>The Forza Tuning package consists of a plethora of mechanical upgrades including a Jokerz Performance ported and polished supercharger, a Griptec pulley, HP Tuners unlocked ECU, AT balancer, ATI crank pin kit, a Gates Supercharger "Green" belt, Milodan thermostat, Kenne Bell Dual Boost-A-Pump, Brisk spark plugs, 1300cc Injectors from Injectors Connection, American Racing Headers 2-inch primary long tubes with high-flow cats, AAD Challenger Wheel Hop Eliminator kit, Sophn rear sway bar link kit, Driveshaft Shop aluminum driveshaft, Per4mance Development DIRS Extreme rear diff brace, Forza dual-valve crankcase breather system, and a Forza supercharger spacer kit. </p>
<p>Once everything was finished in the performance department, the car was given a brand new set of Pilot Sport 4S rubber (295/35/ZR20 front, 305/35/ZR20 rear) from their corporate partners at Michelin. Even more, the gas tank was filled with VP Fuel before being strapped down on the Speed Society Mustang AWD dyno to make sure all 1,100 horses were galloping as they were meant to do. </p>
