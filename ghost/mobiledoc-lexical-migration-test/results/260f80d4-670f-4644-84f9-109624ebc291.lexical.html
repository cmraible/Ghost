<p>I'm not sure how many of my readers are freelancers (and I feel a bit guilty about that, because I feel I <em>should</em> know that sort of information about my audience), but if you are a freelancer, this is for you. The Society of Freelance Journalists is getting more formal and organised, a year after it was founded:</p>
<blockquote>Twelve months later, the Society of Freelance Journalists, as we are now known, has grown to almost 1,500 members all over the world. In the last year, our community has gone from strength to strength. We’ve partnered with the European Journalism Center on <a href="https://journalismassembly.com/tracks" rel="noopener nofollow">a series of workshops</a> and contributed to a <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5801/ldselect/ldcomuni/176/17602.htm" rel="noopener nofollow">House of Lords report</a> on the future of UK journalism. As we mark our first birthday, we’re excited to announce another milestone: SFJ is now a bona fide Community Interest Company.</blockquote>

<p>Born of the bleak times during the early pandemic, the Society was invaluable in helping me find some work to tide me over during the first lockdown when my income dried up. As more of the industry relies on freelancers every year, finding new ways of supporting each other is going to be vital. If you're a freelancer, consider joining the SFJ — it's free!</p>
