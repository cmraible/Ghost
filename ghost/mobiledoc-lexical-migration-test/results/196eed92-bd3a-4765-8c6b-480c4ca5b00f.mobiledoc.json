There’s nothing more fun than that — except more horsepower!” And it was this mindset that made this incredible vehicle even more so incredible. Roger immediately delivered the CJ7 to Tom Strong to be customized which resulted in this one of a kind piece of automotive racing history."

Since 1981 Mears has driven the Jeep a total of just 38,000 miles and has managed to keep it in what appears to be near perfect condition. Included in the sale is the original window sticker showing it was a prize vehicle from Jeep, the original owner's manual, receipts in Roger's name, and a copy of the North Carolina title from the Mears estate."
