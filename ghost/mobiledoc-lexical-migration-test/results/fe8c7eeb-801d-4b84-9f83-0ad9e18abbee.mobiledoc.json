Even more troubling is the increase in violent carjackings. Fortunately this story of a Dodge Challenger swiped in downtown Detroit doesn’t involve violence, but it’s still frustrating to see."

While Dodge has rolled out an update aimed at stopping this, we continue to see Challengers and Chargers stolen using this method."
