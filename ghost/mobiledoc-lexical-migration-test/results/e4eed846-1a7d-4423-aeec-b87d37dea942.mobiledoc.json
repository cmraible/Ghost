We research stories before we interview subjects so that we can ask pertinent questions whose answers will illuminate the subject. We need to be able to do the same thing with our data – we need to know what questions to ask and how, so that even if we can’t make the tools ourselves we can hand over the task to someone else without asking the impossible or wasting their time. </div>\n\n<div></div><div>Nice post from [Mary Hamilton](http://maryhamilton.co.uk/), whose acquaintance I had the pleasure of making at jeecamp. </div>\n"
