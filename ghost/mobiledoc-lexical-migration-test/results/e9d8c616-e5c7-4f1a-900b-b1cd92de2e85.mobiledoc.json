After all, it is a limited-edition, special-conversion of the Chevy Silverado SWB that you don’t see kicking around car lots or even auctions all that often. Adding to its desirability is the fact Chip Foose designed this conversion, a fact that alone will have some people sold immediately."

Instead of just being all show, this Chevy is packing a GM 4.8-liter V8 with a 5-speed manual transmission bolted up. Adding to the allure are ceramic headers, a Power Flow exhaust system, K&N open-air induction system, plus a Regency Sport tuned suspension."

What’s more, the seller is saying there are fewer than 7,900 original miles on the truck, an amount which seems unbelievably low, so someone has really practiced some serious restraint."

Chrome grilles, front spoiler with billet inserts, red stripes, red pinstripes down the sides, and massive square exhaust tips signal this is not ordinary truck. It rolls on 20-inch chrome Regency Speedster wheels with RSA Performance radials."
