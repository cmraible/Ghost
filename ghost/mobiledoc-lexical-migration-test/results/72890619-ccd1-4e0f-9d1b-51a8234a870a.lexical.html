<p>It’s a big week for us here at <em>The Daily Poster</em>: It’s our one-year anniversary.</p>
<p>When we started this venture last year at this time, we had no idea whether it would work. Now, one year in, we have achieved more success than we ever imagined.</p>
<p>We have grown from two writers to an editorial staff of five. Our reporting has been cited by <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1365334764794781699">NBC</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/28/939737434/a-look-at-biden-s-cabinet-picks">NPR</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/530842-sirota-explains-why-bidens-idea-of-bipartisanship-is-mind-boggling"><em>The Hill</em></a><em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/05/tucked-into-the-covid-19-stimulus-package-protection-for-corporations"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/firm-tied-to-biden-contenders-tony-blinken-lloyd-austin-michele-flournoy-looks-to-cash-in-on-covid-response"><em>The Daily Beast</em></a></em>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/spac-with-ties-to-biden-cabinet-picks-sees-surge-in-wall-street-support.html">CNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/11/25/biden_cabinet_picks">Democracy Now</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/01/trailer-what-biden-left-are-demanding-each-other/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, and we have forged editorial partnerships with <em>Jacobin</em>, <em>The Guardian,</em> and <em>Newsweek</em>. Our Daily Poster Live Chats have featured luminaries like <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/daily-poster-live-chat">Cornel West</a>, and <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-daily-posters">Naomi Klein</a>, and drawn a total attendance of more than 4,000 people.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are helping make change. <a href="https://twitter.com/rontkim/status/1362570871920078852?s=20">According</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Biaggi4NY/status/1379686940451209219">to</a><a href="https://twitter.com/yuhline/status/1380383976334974978">lawmakers</a>, our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">investigative series</a> on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s corrupt corporate immunity law was a key factor in the law being officially repealed last week.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s time to celebrate.</p>
<p>For starters, as a commemorative gift, we are thrilled to present our supporting subscribers with our first digital publication — <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEmIILzzEwAwD3nQIUEvaHjyrgAs1j_V/view?usp=sharing"><em><strong>The Daily Poster Citizens’ Guide to Following the Money and Holding the Powerful Accountable</strong></em></a>:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/public/images/36873b39-8924-4853-b090-5afa7399e483_539x711.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>The result of several months of work, the guide features many of the tools we use to scrutinize authority: How to file public records requests, how to demand answers from your lawmakers, how to scrutinize the media, how to uncover business records, how to track political donations, how to expose dark money groups, and much more.</p>
<p>All of it is designed specifically for you, our supporting subscribers. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEmIILzzEwAwD3nQIUEvaHjyrgAs1j_V/view?usp=sharing">Click here</a> to immediately obtain your digital edition of the Citizens’ Guide, which you can either read online or download for personal use. (If you have trouble accessing it, just <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com">email us</a> and we will send it to you directly.)</p>
<p>Think of it as a token of our gratitude for your unwavering support — but it is also a key part of our mission, which is placing the tools for scrutinizing power in the hands of the people.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. We’re also throwing a party.</p>
<p>This Wednesday 4/14 at 7 pm ET (4pm PT), our team will be holding a <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/dailyposteranniversary">celebratory live chat</a>. We will be sharing a bit about ourselves, discussing lessons learned over the past year, and unveiling exciting plans for our future.</p>
