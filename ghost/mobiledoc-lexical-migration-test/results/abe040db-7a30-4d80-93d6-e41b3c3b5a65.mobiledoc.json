The fact the owner obviously de-badged it makes identifying the exact model more difficult. That being said, itâ€™s almost always someone with a lower model who removes the badges so they can try to act like they have a cooler car, but thatâ€™s not always the case. Either way, this guy gets to wait, pay a big fine, then get his Mopar back. Hopefully this time he realizes taking it to the track is cheaper and smarter."
