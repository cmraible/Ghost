<p>For the 11th consecutive year in a row, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/importance-of-rpm-act/">SEMA Action Network</a> (SAN) is encouraging people to celebrate their collector car during ‘<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/classic-car-collecting/">Collector Car</a> Appreciation Day’ today, July 9th. The day is officially recognized by Senate Resolution 271, and a similar House Resolution, 108, recognizes the day as “an annual event to celebrate and raise awareness of the vital role automotive restoration and collection plays in American society,” according to SAN.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn why collecting cars isn't as pricey as it seems <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/classic-car-collecting/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The co-chairs of the Congressional Automotive Performance and Motorsports Caucus, including Sen. Richard Burr (North Carolina), Sen. Jon Tester (Montana), Rep. Bill Posey (Florida), and Rep. Sanford Bishop Jr. (Georgia) introduced the resolutions are part of the lobbying arm (SAN) of SEMA.</p>
<p>“These Congressional leaders are strong advocates for the automotive hobby in Washington, D.C.,” The SEMA Action Network offered. “The Caucus is an informal, non-partisan member organization that pays tribute to America’s ever-growing love affair with the car and motorsports.</p>
<p>“Intended to celebrate the classics of the past and the future, the U.S. Congress helped launch CCAD by passing resolutions each year since 2010 at the SAN’s request. The previous resolutions were sponsored by co-chairs of the SEMA-supported Congressional Automotive Performance and Motorsports Caucus.</p>
<p>“These Congressional leaders have been strong advocates for the automotive hobby in Washington, D.C., and recognize the integral role collector cars have played in fostering our nation’s appreciation for the automobile’s unique historical place in our history. In fact, the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, as well as most of the Canadian provinces, officially marked the occasion.”</p>
<p>SAN has a list of officially scheduled events to commemorate the automobile, and individuals and clubs can use the network to promote any event they are hosting for free.
