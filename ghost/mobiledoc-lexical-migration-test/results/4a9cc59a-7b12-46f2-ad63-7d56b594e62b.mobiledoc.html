<p>Plenty of buzz swirled around the upcoming auction of John Harvey’s 1977 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-reunited-with-stolen-28-years/">Holden Torana</a> A9X, with some industry analysts excitedly predicting the classic Australian <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1988-camaro-iroc-z-race-car/">race car</a> would hammer at over $1 million. When all was done, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/holden-death-closes-another-chapter-in-car-history/">Holden</a>was still one of the most expensive of the brand to ever auction, reaching a lofty $910,000 AUD at a recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-chevelle-fast-furious/">Lloyds event</a>.</p>

<p>This car had been crashed at Mount Panorama in 1978 when Charlie O’Brien, Harvey’s co-driver, was behind the wheel. It was fixed and continued to compete, including capturing a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/restored-1985-march-85g-gtp-acecar/">podium finish</a> for the 1979 Australian Touring Car Championship. A restoration performed back in 1993 has returned the car to its glory, then it sat on display in museums for the public to enjoy.</p>

<p>Australians will be pleased to know the buyer, who wants to remain anonymous, has plans to keep the Holden race car in Australia. Some enthusiasts have been dismayed at Americans, Europeans, and others “raiding” their classic car stashes, funneling vehicles away from the island nation, even though that activity can go both ways.</p>

<p>John Harvey famously drove this Holden Torana A9X in the wake of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/peter-champion-27-peter-brock-cars/">Peter Brock</a> leaving the HDT team after winning Bathurst 9 times. It wears the Marlboro livery used in races for an authentic presentation which really takes Australian motorsports fans back.</p>

<p>With a final price north of $900,000, this Torana A9X has become one of the priciest Holdens out there. The buyer also pays a 7.5 percent premium, which totals $68,250. Earlier in 2020 a 1969 Holden Monaro race car auctioned for a lofty $715,000, wowing observers and enthusiasts. That no doubt helped fuel speculation that John Harvey’s former car would hit 7 digits. However, back in 2018 Peter Brock’s Holden VH Commodore which he used in 1982 and 1983 to win Bathurst hammered for $2.1 million, thanks to a hardcore and well-heeled motorsports enthusiast.</p>
