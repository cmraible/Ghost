A classic Ford Mustang that was damaged in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina has been rehabbed, and is now a show winning ride. Once completely submerged under water, this Ford Mustang is now sweeping car show awards around the country."

          "During Hurricane Katrina, it’s estimated that somewhere around 570,000 cars were damaged; it was one of the costliest natural disasters to many forms of property. Harvey might be recent in your memory from the damage it did to cars when it hit the gulf, hitting an unfortunate sweet spot, but it didn’t quite pass the number Katrina racked up. So maybe we’ll see that Challenger floating around after Harvey restored in 16 years, maybe not. However, this Ford Mustang is a beacon of hope."
