That’s the apparent story with this 1988 Porsche 928 which was found buried in the snow on the side of the house. In other words, it seemed to be abandoned. While it sat outside for what’s believed to be 15 years, it accumulated all kinds of grime."

          "The guy who found the car negotiated with the owner for 6 months before finalizing the deal. That’s where AMMO NYC comes in. If you aren’t familiar with this car detailing service, they take on plenty of grimy jobs like this one. Before doing anything else with the Porsche 928, it needed a deep cleaning. To see all that grime washed away and be replaced by sparkling paint and brightwork is amazing."

          "If you don’t know, the 928 was the first production Porsche to use a V8 engine. Not only did it forego the flat engine layout and get two to four more cylinders than its brand siblings, the 928 had the engine up front like so many other sports cars. The 911 fans immediately cried blasphemy because to them, Porsches all had to use a flat engine mounted in the rear if not mid-ship. The other way was not only wrong, it was offensive."

It’s great to see one of the 928s being treated with respect after it was abandoned all those years, honoring the legacy it represents. Plus it’s satisfying seeing all that built-up grime get washed away. Check it out."
