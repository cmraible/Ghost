<p><em>Trying something new this morning. Weekday digests are going to be a limited selection of "news you can use". I'll save the opinion pieces and longer reads for a weekend edition. <a href="mailto:adam@onemanandhisblog.com"><em>Let me know</em></a> if this works better for you. </em></p>

<h2 id="making-instagram-stories-work-for-you">Making Instagram Stories work for you</h2>
<p>Good piece from Jacob over at my pals journalism.co.uk, detailing how Francesco (a former student - <em>this is a slightly nepotistic digest, sorry. It's not my fault that half of the UK's audience engagement experts were once my students‚Ä¶</em> üòá) goes about experimenting and refining their strategy for using Stories.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong> Experimentation is not enough alone: you need sensible measures to understand what is working and what isn't. </p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-ok-boomer-on-twitter">The end of "OK, Boomer" on Twitter?</h2>
<p><strong>What you need to know: </strong>Twitter has changed its rules to ban language that dehumanizes people on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/twitter-bans-hate-speech-around-age-disability-and-in-the-wake-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-disease/">basis of their age, disability or disease</a> status.

<h2 id="two-seo-quickies">Two SEO quickies</h2>
<p>Google has been migrating to a mobile-first index over the last few years. That process is pretty much over. </p>
<p><strong>What you need to know: </strong>From September onwards, if your mobile performance isn't good in terms both usability and speed, you'll be hobbled in search traffic. Check now - and act. </p>

<p>This second one will only impact a few of you, but worth knowing, if you're on WordPress.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to know: </strong>several SEO-centric WordPress plugins seem to have bugs. Keep your plugins as updated as you can. And if you're seeing a drop in search traffic, check if any of these bugs apply to you‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="overwhelmed-by-newsletters">Overwhelmed by newsletters?</h2>
<p>One of the reasons I've slightly modified this format, is that I've had feedback that people are already feeling over-whelmed by information. A digest should be more, well, <em>digested</em>. However, here's another approach:</p>

<p>One does wonder when we end up back at blogs and RSS readers, though‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="an-engaged-journalism-event">An engaged journalism event</h2>
<p>I've always enjoyed the Digital Editors network events, even though it's nearly five years since I managed to get to one. (I remember chatting to an attendee about the forthcoming birth of my second child‚Ä¶ and she's got her fifth birthday soon.)</p>
<p>I'll be at this one, as they've got <a href="https://digitaleditorsnetwork.blogspot.com/2020/03/digital-editors-from-news-uk-and.html">some great people on board</a>, including Beth Ashton, a former student who is now leading the digital engagement at <em>The Telegraph, </em>and Nick Petrie from<em> The Times</em>. </p>
