<hr>
<p>It’s one thing to read about a car, another thing to walk around it and ride inside, and yet another thing to actually drive it. That’s especially the case with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1927-ford-model-t-showcases-great-expectations/">Ford Model T</a>, the car that popularized the automobile and became a national as well as an international phenomenon. However, most people today don’t understand <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-model-t-off-roading/">what it took to drive one</a>, but a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/tour-some-virtual-auto-museums/">museum</a> in Michigan will teach you.</p>
<p>Located in Hickory Corners, Gilmore Car Museum is one of the largest <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-henry-ford-shuts-down-for-coronavirus-outbreak/">automotive museums</a> in the region. It’s loaded with hundreds of historic cars like a 1930 Rolls-Royce you might recognize from an old Disney movie and a 1957 Chevy.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a museum that’s all looking and no touching. The 90-acre campus acts as a kind of driving school for those wanting to learn how to drive a Ford Model T. Just because you can drive a modern car well doesn’t mean you know anything about these classics, which have no gas pedal but come with a hand lever and three foot pedals as well as two hand controls on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Learning to drive a Ford Model T is an experience which will teach you to appreciate how far the user-friendly nature of cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/henry-ford-quotes/">has progressed in the past century</a>. It also helps anyone understand just how much skill driving an automobile required back in the day. Instruction lasts about 3 hours and you get to check out the museum for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>To take the course, you have to be present at the museum and you have to show of a valid driver’s license or learner’s permit. That means your new driver can absolutely join in on the fun and maybe realize just how relatively easy driving a modern car is. A Certificate of Completion that’s fit for framing and mounting on your office wall comes with the course, and that’s a near souvenir to show off.</p>
