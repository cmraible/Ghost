<p>Some people push the automotive boundaries just to ruffle feathers, get others to think, or because they can. We’re not sure if any of those reasons are behind this creation customfncustoms showed off on Facebook recently. The California shop has teamed up with Abimelec Design to completely transform a BMW E46 by putting a 1965 Ford Mustang body on the chassis and attaching a Dodge Challenger Hellcat front. It’s one way to anger BMW, Ford, and Mopar purists all at the same time.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the car looks pretty good, instead of being some cobbled-together mess which should never have been conceived of in the first place. Considerable work has been done to ensure the transition between the Hellcat front and the Mustang body is seamless. With big fender flares and smaller wheels than you’d probably expect to see on a modern American muscle car, this ride looks a little off, especially if you stare at it for too long.</p>

<p>Those glowing stripes are supposed to be Lumilor paint. If you aren’t familiar with the product, it’s electroluminescent, so when electricity is applied it will light up. In other words, you could make any car look kind of like a Tron vehicle, which we must admit is pretty cool, even if we know some people will abuse that in the most retina-scorching ways imaginable. It’s being touted as a solution for increasing visibility for motorcyclists, cyclists, and others at night, which is a great idea.</p>

<p>We get not everyone is going to like this build, but have a feeling customfncustoms won’t really care. It’s definitely a unique car and probably will still that way. What you’re seeing right now are renderings, so it’ll be interesting to see the finished product and how it actually turns out.</p>
