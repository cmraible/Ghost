This unique technical school has helped enthusiasts stay up to date with all of the performance technology out there and continue to expand their knowledge in the tuner world. Over the years, Tuner School has helped hundreds of enthusiasts \"break into the tuning and aftermarket industries,\" and it didn't hurt its employee candidate pool either – one of Tuner School's 2012 graduates, 28-year-old Jerry Dellarportas, is now Hennessey's lead technician and shop foreman."

The school is located in Sealy, Texas, and it teaches students of performance car skill sets ranging everywhere basic fabrication and racer math to chassis dyno operation and speed measurements and telemetry. The purpose of Tuner School is not only to teach students how to make cars faster but it also focuses on character building and basic business understanding."

If that's not good enough, enrolled students receive free access to public events held at the nearby Lonestar Motorsports Park including free track time during regular events. What better place to learn about fast cars than on the track!"
