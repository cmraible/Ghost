<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1974-bmw-3-0cs-56/">Making its debut in 1968</a>, the classic BMW made a name for itself on the touring car race track. It all started with a Karmann body fitted with a 2,788-cc inline-six but progressed in 1971, making the 3.0CS the most powerful E9 up to that point.</p>

Powering the car is a M30 3.0-liter inline-six with dual carburetors that sent through an automatic transmission that it was equipped with off the assembly line. When new, the power rating is 170-horsepower. In March of 2021, service was performed to the ignition system, replacing the valve cover gasket, and changing the fluids.</p>
