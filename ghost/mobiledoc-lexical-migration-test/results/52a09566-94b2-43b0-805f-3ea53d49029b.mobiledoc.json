The most obvious is the Bandit graphics and unique badging, which along with the gold Bandit snowflake make an immediate connection between the classic Pontiac muscle car and this Jeep. A 3.5-inch Rough Country lift kit allows plenty of clearance for the 38-inch tires. You’ll notice the interior has gold accent stitching, a Bandit Edition inscription on the dash, and a special badge on the center console."
