<p>Whether it's a rolling chassis, an interesting mash-up, or a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-1970-challenger/">one-of-a-kind SEMA build</a>, eBay is a great way to find cars listed for sale with no shortage of variety. Currently <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264857938012">listed on eBay</a> is a 1978 Ford Mustang II that was once a multi-time <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-cancelled/">SEMA</a> show display vehicle. On top of that, it landed in the top 10 of the 2014 "SEMA Battle of the Builders", top 5 for Gran Turismo, and was a participant in OUCSCI (Optima Ultimate Street Car Invitational). As mentioned above, there's no place like eBay while browsing car listings. </p>

<p>Owned by Brett Behrens from Portland, Oregon, this stunning <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bullitt-mustang-vs-dodge-charger/">Mustang</a> II nicknamed Evolution started life as a shell that had seen better days. A wrecked <a href="__GHOST_URL__/p/b6f279a1-1f52-4b4d-9636-b95aa3dd50aa/motorious.com/articles/features-3/is-the-corvette-z06-the-best-sports-car-you-can-buy/">Chevy Corvette Z06</a> was also acquired by Gordon Aram of A-Team Racing after he discovered the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-ford-mustang-boss-429-auction/">Mustang</a> shell, so this second-generation pony features bowtie parts from those parts such as the factory 6-piston brakes and an independent rear suspension.</p>
<p>Before the car made its way onto eBay, stuffed under the hood was a Ford Triton 431-cubic-inch (6.8-liter) V10 engine that is shifted via a six-speed transaxle. Everything is settled into a fully custom steel-tube frame chassis. To make the car more aesthetically pleasing, they stretched this pony's wheelbase 12 inches.</p>

<p>The car was in the process of becoming a new version with $80,000 spent on body modification and improvements, so it was disassembled and prepped for paint. Now, Bret has listed the 1978 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mach-1-accident/">Mustang</a> II <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-cancelled/">SEMA</a> car on eBay to see if somebody else would like to paint it and put it back together. If interested in this incredible ride, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264857938012">make sure to visit eBay</a> and place your bid so you can reassemble this incredible Mustang II back to life. </p>
