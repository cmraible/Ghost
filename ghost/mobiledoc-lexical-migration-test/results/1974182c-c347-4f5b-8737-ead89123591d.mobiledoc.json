Perhaps one of the best modern embodiments of this mantra is something like this "

It’s also running a Raceline dry-sump lubrication system, Radtec aluminum radiator, and Pactel T2 engine management for good measure. Using the 5-speed manual transmission, you can really get this roadster moving in a hurry, making it a truly wicked little track toy or weekend cruiser, your choice."

The full clamshell fenders keep stones, mud, and so forth from spraying you during fun drives. A black roll bar provides some safety just in case, while there’s a low-profile wind deflector for a little more comfort, however a full windshield and side windows will be included with this car."

A Racetech steering wheel is wrapped in leather and features a quick-release hub.
