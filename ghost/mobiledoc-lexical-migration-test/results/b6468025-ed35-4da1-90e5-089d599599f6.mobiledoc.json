          "There’s a new record quarter mile run for the C8 Corvette as tuners see just how hard they can push the mid-engine American sports car. It was FuelTech’s build which blasted down the track, The car polished off the quarter mile in 8.973 seconds at 160.92 mph, making it the fastest C8 Corvette in the quarter mile so far. This amazing feat was pulled off at Orlando Speed World recently."

          "Pushing 1,350-whp, the FuelTech C8 Corvette is one wicked beast. The setup includes twin Garrett G35-900 turbochargers mounted over the LT2. Since there’s ethanol injection plus a Nitrous Outlet setup, FuelTech didn’t install an intercooler. Turbosmart electronic control wastegates are also included. Fortifying the engine are internals sourced from Gwatney Performance like forged Diamond Pistons and Wiseco Boostline connecting rods to handle all that boost."

          "Integrated into the mix is also a PowerFT engine management system, a technological marvel which works in concert with the PCM to manage fuel delivery, spark, and power so the entire powertrain runs smoothly. The genius of this tech is that it allows the factory PCM to do most of vehicle systems, plus it includes a work-around for the torque management programmed by the factory. In addition, there’s a second ECU installed just for drivetrain management, which allows for switching settings for drag strip or road course runs. It’s great to see some aftermarket builders are finding ways to hack the C8 after GM has tried playing games with that."

          "As you might recall, a previous record was set by Emelia Hartford’s team when they used a 1,000+-hp C8 Corvette to run the quarter mile in 9.41 seconds. However, FuelTech was able to do it in 9.01 seconds. We wonder if they’ll try to take down FuelTech’s new record, because this could shape up to be an interesting rivalry, but we haven’t heard much from Hartford’s crew lately."
