The updated version is getting a release across all major home consoles, including the Switch, and promises to provide great replay value due to its roguelike structure.

Along the way, you encounter demonic enemies of increasing difficulty as well as a number of environmental hazards such as spikes and lava, which all add to the stress of navigating your way through. You are incentivised to keep the number of bullets you fire to a minimum and of course, as you probably guessed, any death means going back to the hub and starting again. However, you build up your knowledge and tactical know-how as well as your gear through RPG-type upgrades, all of which can be put to good use if you want to keep progressing further and further."

          ") on the computer screen. This ties an element of escape-room into the plot which is an intriguing spin on the genre. The activities and progress you make in the core game have an effect on how your human equivalent can move around and interact with their bedroom. It’s not easy to explain but I found it enjoyable and the bedroom set-up certainly offset some of the repetition."

Being a roguelike, there is a fair bit of repetition and being in a constant loop of predominantly monochrome coloured screens became a bit dreary. If you make a game like this, you need to inject as much pizzazz into the colour pallet as possible. However, the pixel art is gorgeous and super-detailed, and the backgrounds are wonderfully designed."

Funnily enough, I somehow turned off the music in the aforementioned textless options menu and I was unable to work out how to turn it back on after the first hour of gameplay! However from what I recall, it was pretty haunting and gothic, quite like the visuals."

There’s a whole lot of trial and error which can become very frustrating very quickly. If you like unforgiving roguelike games where you need to grind to get very far, then you’ll love this game. However if you like a game which is gently paced and forgiving, then this really isn’t for you. "
