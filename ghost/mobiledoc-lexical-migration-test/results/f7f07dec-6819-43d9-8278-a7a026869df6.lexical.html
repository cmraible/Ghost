<p><a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851768-1999-Plymouth-Prowler-">Chrysler's design</a> and international director Thomas C. Gale has a true affection for 1930s-era hot rods. In fact, at one time he built a Hemi V8 powered, 1933 Ford highboy roadster that was featured in at least one publication. Regardless of which came first, his roadster or the <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851768-1999-Plymouth-Prowler-">Plymouth Prowler</a>, it’s obvious that Gale couldn’t get enough of the open-wheel hot rod design and wanted to improve up on it with a more modern version.</p>

<p>Despite catching criticism over engine choices, the retro-styled <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851768-1999-Plymouth-Prowler-">Plymouth Prowler</a> was well-received at the time and still turns heads today. It featured a front-mounted 253-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine joined to a rear-mounted automatic transmission by a torque tube. The drivetrain layout that resembles the one used by the C5 Corvette afforded the modern hot rod a near 50-50 weight distribution which made for an incredibly fun driving experience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the car that was assembled by hand at the Conner Avenue Assembly Plant alongside the Viper RT/10 only lasted for a single generation and was discontinued after only 11,702 examples were made. Although, this meant that as of 2003 fans could no longer go buy a new one, it now means that these cars are not only desirable but also relatively rare. <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851768-1999-Plymouth-Prowler-">Awesome Joe Auctions</a> is giving <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/history-of-plymouth-prowler/">Plymouth Prowler</a> enthusiasts the opportunity to add a <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851768-1999-Plymouth-Prowler-">1999 example</a> to their garage.
