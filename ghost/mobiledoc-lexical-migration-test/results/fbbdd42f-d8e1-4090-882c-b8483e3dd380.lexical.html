You know you’re in good hands when it comes to an all-star voice cast such as Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, Masasa Moyo, Wil Wheaton, and Pendleton Ward. Couple all those names with the fact that this game comes from the same creators who brought us Grim Fandango and Psychonauts, I just don’t think it gets much better than that!</p>
