Power is shifted down to the pavement by a built AOD automatic transmission with a shift kit. Adding performance and enhancing the beefy V8 rumble are Ford Motorsport ceramic coated headers that flow down through a stainless steel 2.5-inch exhaust and exit via Flowmaster mufflers. This truck features a Fatman Mustang II front end, a No Limits rear four-link suspension and coil over shocks. Wilwood brakes bring all power to a halt."
