          "Bruce leaves behind a long legacy having the Bruce McLaren Intermediate School in West Auckland named after him not long after his death, and the school sits on Bruce McLaren Road in a suburb of McLaren Park. Back in 2015, New Zealand's Taupo Motorsport Park was given his name instead. In 2000, a Bruce McLaren Scholarship was given out to rising New Zealand racing drivers by Motorsport NZ and Prodrive Trust. He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1991, and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1995. Now, he was given the Icon Award at the London Classic Car Show. It's safe to say that McLaren has cemented his name into the history books of motorsports."
