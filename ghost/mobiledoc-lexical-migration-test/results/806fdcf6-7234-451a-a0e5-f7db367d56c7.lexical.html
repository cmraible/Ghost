According to an analysis by </em>Sludge<em>, this would require at least 15 members of the House to resign from board positions. (Senators are already banned from sitting on corporate boards while in office.)</em></p>

<h4 id="reader-comment-of-the-week-"><strong>READER COMMENT OF THE WEEK:</strong></h4>
<p>“I am no strategist, but I will give my opinion anyway. I think that progressives should start a relentless push of the message that yes, the government can do a lot for people, and as the results start to show –– in particular the child payments –– make the contrast between the good that investment in people's lives creates and how waste in the military and the "defense" spending are just sinking the country. Educate the people on the waste of the F-35, or the billions being spent on NEW nuclear weapons –– as if we need more than one to obliterate life. Maybe this is one way to get people involved, demanding that the good parts of this bill become permanent by educating them on how much waste is ignored in things that don't work and destroy lives for no reason with the wars of aggression we engage in. Organize, educate, agitate.”</p>
