<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick note to let you know some exciting news — as of today, <em>The Daily Poster</em> is bringing on Joel Warner as our new managing editor. He will be working with me; senior editor and reporter Andrew Perez; and reporters Julia Rock and Walker Bragman.</p>
<p>This is a big moment for this project — in less than a year, we have been able to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-year-of-accountability-journalism/">break big stories</a> and find an audience of subscribers whose support has helped us build out a team dedicated to accountability journalism. We are not able to do this work without our supporting subscribers — so thank you for being one.</p>
<p>Joel is an award-winning journalist and author known for his nonfiction narrative reporting. He has been published in, among others, <em>Esquire, Wired, Men’s Journal, Businessweek, Slate</em>, and <em>Grantland</em>. He is the co-author of <a href="https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781451665413"><em>The Humor Code: A Global Search for What Makes Things Funny</em></a>, and he has an upcoming book based on his major <em>Esquire </em>report on a financial scandal that rocked Europe. You can find out more about Joel <a href="https://www.joelwarner.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>We will keep you posted on our progress — but for now, let me just offer another thank you to everyone who has joined our team by becoming a supporting subscriber. Together, we are building a new grassroots-funded model for journalism that holds power accountable. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
