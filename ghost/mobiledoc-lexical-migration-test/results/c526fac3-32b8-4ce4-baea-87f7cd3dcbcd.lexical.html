<p>In the new episode of our weekly podcast <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota is joined by Jordan Uhl, who has been covering last week’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ticketmaster-faces-the-music/">Ticketmaster debacle</a> in which thousands of Taylor Swift fans learned the hard way what happens when antitrust law isn’t enforced. The two were also joined by Max Collins, frontman for the rock band Eve 6, who has firsthand experience with the abusive practices of the giant corporations that now control the music industry (25:46).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/c4bdcab5/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>In addition, David discusses one of the country’s first-ever dark money disclosure laws passed during the recent midterms — Arizona Proposition 211 — and speaks with former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, who has spent the better part of the last decade fighting to get the law passed (4:37).</p>
