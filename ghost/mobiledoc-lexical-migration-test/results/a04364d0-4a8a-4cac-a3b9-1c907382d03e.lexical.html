<hr>
<p>Originally intended as a moniker to denote a top-of-the-line 1957 Star Chief, the Bonneville became its own separate model in 1958. This meant that for the first time, a base model <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/624/1975-pontiac-bonneville?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">Bonneville</a> could be had and most of the luxurious features that made the name popular among Pontiac buyers were now optional but that was far from a downgrade. In fact, it opened up doors for the model that were previously unavailable. Buyers that were not able to afford all of the luxury options could now pick the ones more important to them, essentially getting a better car for a more affordable price. On top of that, the model was now available with a hard top instead of <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/624/1975-pontiac-bonneville?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">just as a convertible</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout the first four generations, <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/624/1975-pontiac-bonneville?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=april21">Bonnevilles</a> evolved dramatically though Pontiac kept the model as its top-of-the-line model. In 1970, styling for the fourth generation peaked with a complete front and rear end redesign and a boost in power thanks to the new 455-cid engine. However, after that year, the automaker moved the model down in rank to make room at the top for the Grand Ville series. However, the new model did not seem up for the task and just five model years later it was kicked to the curb, making the Bonneville number one once again.</p>
