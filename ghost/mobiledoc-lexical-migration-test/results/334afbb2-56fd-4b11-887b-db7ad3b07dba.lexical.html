<p>If you love looking at cars, you may think your eyes have practically glazed over, no matter what you see. But when you look at these Porsches, you’ll most certainly find yourself doing a double– or even triple take. First of all, they’re basically the perfect assortment from the iconic eras of the Porsche marque. But beyond that, they’re all being offered together at <a href="http://www.goodingco.com/">Gooding & Company’s</a><a href="https://www.goodingco.com/auction/amelia-island-auction-2023/">Amelia Island Auctions in March</a>, which is especially remarkable. Allow us to introduce our current obsessions.</p>

<p>This has got to be one of the best hits on Porsche’s repertoire. It’s none other than a stunning RS 2.7. Better yet, this example comes finished in the gorgeously classic and original light yellow over black leather color scheme. It doesn’t just look pretty though. It also boasts a 2,681 cc flat-six engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection, which means that it’s engineered with the utmost care. If that isn’t enough, it’s also accompanied by a whole lot of valuable paperwork about how great it is, including extensive service records, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gullwing-porsche-coming/">Porsche</a> Certificate of Authenticity, and a well-documented restoration. Did you get chills reading that too?</p>

<p>Right this way towards more jaw-dropping Porsche Carreras. This one is a 1995 993 Carrera RS Clubsport, which is a pretty iconic model for the company. In fact, in 1995, the 993 Carrera RS was a specially designed model for competition use. It boasts similar features to the typical Carrera, except with aerodynamic measures to make it lighter on the track. Compared to the regular RSR 3.8 model, this one is about 220 lbs lighter. This particular car is one of only 1,104 examples built, with a very extensive log of features, basically detailing how rare it is and why. It also sounds pretty fun to drive, if we might add.</p>

<p>When you think of absolutely gorgeous, timeless, interesting Porsches, there’s one T word that might cross your mind… Turbo. The turbocharged technology-enabled 930 is much loved by all, not only because it looks good, but also because it’s a feat of engineering. It was born out of the 911, with the very big modification of a turbocharged flat-six engine, flared wheel arches for wider wheels, and a “whale tail” rear spoiler. This is one beautiful example. It’s one of only 677 Rest of World (ROW) market coupes finished in Paint-to-Sample. It had just less than 11,221km or 7,000 miles on its odometer when Gooding & Company catalogued it.</p>

<p>Here’s another tidbit of Porsche history. Max Hoffman, who worked for Porsche in the 50s, wanted to create a model to compete with other popular purpose-built cars at the time, like offerings from MG, Austin-Healey, and Triumph. Essentially, he was looking for something that was fast, without being too frou-frou. The Speedster was born, which ended up being one of the most beautiful models Porsche ever made, while also being incredible to drive. The T2 model, a.k.a. the kind offered here, is among the best within the Speedster category. It has undergone a crazy-good restoration to enhance the car’s performance while retaining its factory-original appearance. It has a rare factory color and a powerful, upgraded engine. It’s a real stunner and a real Speedster all in one.</p>

<p>If we’re talking rare and iconic, we cannot exclude the 1977 Porsche 934/5 from the conversation. It would be unjust. Put simply, the 934/5 is one race-ready car. It was the last of 10 examples ever built, with a very extensive racing history in the 70s– it earned top 10 finishes at Sears Point and Pocono, as well as 3rd Place at the Daytona Finale. This model has a whole lot of swag. In 1978, this 934/5 was updated with 935 style-bodywork, before being stripped down right after. Finally, it was meticulously and completely restored to its proper 1977 specification, as well as the Desperado Racing Livery. It has been built and restored by true Porsche specialists, granting it the highest levels of historic competition, while also making it a rare and beautiful bird.
