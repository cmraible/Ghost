Critics praised the car for its elegant and aerodynamic design and the car enjoyed 14 long years of production. The later 1971 model even came with a rowdy V12 engine putting out some insane power numbers. However, "

Even Enzo Ferrari has been quoted as saying that it is “The most beautiful car ever made” which is in large part due to the car's aerodynamic shape. Malcolm Sayar brought this car to life by utilizing the same aerodynamic tactics reserved for only planes and race-cars at the time. This allowed for not only a beautiful design but also high aerodynamic performance."

Restoration for this car entailed the disassembly down to bare metal, bead blasting of many parts, and the replating of all the chrome. A full rebuild of the engine, transmission, suspension, and hydraulics was also in order and the braking system was upgraded."

Perhaps the highest value adder on the list of commendations for this car is its certificate of Jaguar Heritage with matching numbers for the chassis, engine, gearbox, and body. "
