<p>It's been quite a few days since I last wrote one of these. And they have been startling ones, even in these strange times. In the UK, the power of the media to change public opinion has been reasserted in dramatic form, as reports of the Prime Minister's closest aide's behaviour during lockdown broke out of the media bubble, and spread across the whole country. A <em>Daily Mail</em> poll showed that <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8359511/Majority-Conservative-supporters-believe-Dominic-Cummings-sacked.html">the vast majority of the country think he</a> should go.</p>
<p>There is <em>so much </em>to unpick in this, but I'm not going to have time to do so until next week. And who knows where things will be by then?</p>
<h2 id="twitter-versus-trump">Twitter versus Trump</h2>
<p>However, that's not the only change in the landscape. Twitter has finally started developing a backbone about the misinformer-in-chief:</p>

<p>This is a significant move, because now it's stepped over this line, the company has to decide when it will do so in future, and in as consistent a manner as it can. Twitter has been one of the major vectors for the President to spread misinformation. Trying to cram the horse back into the stable and close the door is going to be a sisyphean task, if you'll excuse the mixed metaphor. </p>
<p>For example, this decision is not playing out well:</p>

<h3 id="oh-facebook">Oh, Facebook</h3>
<p>Of course, Facebook knew that it was causing division to grow in society years ago. And what did it do?</p>
<p>It shrugged:</p>

<p>This should be shocking at a basic human level, let alone a corporate responsibility one. But we've all come to expect this from them, haven't we?</p>
<h2 id="the-subscriptions-boom">The Subscriptions Boom</h2>
<p>I'm not going to surprise anyone here by saying that this has been a rough couple of months for media businesses. The super short version is that there are three major streams of revenue for media companies right now:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ads</li>
    <li>Events</li>
    <li>Subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>The pandemic has brutalised two of those for the time being - and so, attention has shifted to the third: subscriptions. For some, the news has been good.</p>

<p>There's a lot more information on the subject in the INMA report by Grzegorz Piechota, which I was lucky enough to edit. It's a fascinating read, that explores in detail exactly which readers are becoming subscribers - and how you might go about retaning them.</p>
<p>Highly recommended (but I would say that, wouldn't I?):</p>

<p>More to come on that subject, but again, probably not until next week. </p>
