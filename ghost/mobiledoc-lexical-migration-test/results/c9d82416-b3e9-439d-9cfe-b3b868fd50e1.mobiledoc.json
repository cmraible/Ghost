Car culture is full of shibboleths or anachronisms that the average person either doesn’t understand or is completely unaware exist. This is especially true when talking about classic cars. You need to know the lingo, or you’ll be pegged as a poser in no time. Fortunately, Classic Car Club of America has produced a guide for speaking the language of CCCA."

The problem is if you want to use modern names for components, that’s not what everything was called when these cars were made. Way back when automobiles were first coming into prominence, car designers and automakers will still using terms from coachbuilding. They also made up terms for marketing purposes."

But, were you aware that when it comes to the classics, a “station wagon” is built of wood and is a utility model? Usually station wagons have four doors, but that’s not necessary. Some people think any wagon is a station wagon, but if it’s not built out of wood, technically it’s not one."
