<p>The message from Georgia is clear: People want help from Congress.</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1346681326934650880">appear to have won</a> both Georgia senate runoff races on Tuesday and secured full control of Congress — and they owe their likely victories to mass frustration with the way that lawmakers have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/senate-special-election-runoff/georgia">CNN exit polls</a>, 54 percent of Georgia voters said the pandemic has caused them financial hardship, with 15 percent of respondents saying it has caused them severe financial hardship.</p>
<p>More than 70 percent of Georgia voters said that Congress is doing too little to help the financial situations of individual Americans and small businesses, according to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results/voter-analysis?race=R2&state=GA">Fox News Voter Analysis survey</a> conducted during the week before the election. More than half of voters said Congress is doing too much to help large corporations.</p>
<p>Both Democratic senate candidates, Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/georgia-democrats-close-populist-pitch-vowing-2-000-stimulus-checks-n1252805">centered their campaigns</a> around a push for $2,000 survival checks from Washington — an idea backed by progressives like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as well as Republican President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-shift-shows-pressure-can-work/">got on board</a> with the measure too, telling Georgia voters on Monday that electing Ossoff and Warnock “will put an end to the block in Washington on that $2,000 stimulus check, that money that will go out the door immediately to people who are in real trouble.”</p>
<p>The Fox survey found that 62 percent of Georgia voters say they support changing the health care system so that any American can buy into a government-run health care plan if they want to — an idea commonly known as a public health insurance option. Those results are consistent with Fox’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results/voter-analysis?race=R&state=GA">survey</a> of Georgia voters before the November election.</p>
<p>More than half of voters, 56 percent, said they were concerned about <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/a-timeline-of-investigations-into-perdue-loeffler-stock-trading/L6TU65WK5JBFXKDC4YWBKGGNPU/">allegations</a> that incumbent Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler had both engaged in insider trading, according to the Fox survey.</p>
