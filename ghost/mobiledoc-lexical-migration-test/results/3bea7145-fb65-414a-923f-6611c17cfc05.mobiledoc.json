Before you get too excited, it was only 33 of these movie-inspired cars which met up during an event called Bullitt Days held in central France, per a report from Ford Authority."

Even though the Mustang is popular with some enthusiasts in Europe, it’s still nothing close to the kind of excitement Americans have for the pony car. Plus, it’s a lot cheaper here and more powerful than in a lot of other areas of the world."
