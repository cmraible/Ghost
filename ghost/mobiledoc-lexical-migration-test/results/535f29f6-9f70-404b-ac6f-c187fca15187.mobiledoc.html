<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p>Mario has come a long way since jumping on that first Goomba in World 1-1 of the original Super Mario Bros. Now, 35 years since the launch of that game in Japan, he is starring in games new on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo-switch-systems/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, lending his likeness to brands like LEGO and Monopoly, and there will even be a <em>Super Mario</em>-themed Splatfest in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/catalogue/splatoon-2" target="_blank">Splatoon 2</a> .</p>
    <p>In a new video presentation released today, Nintendo detailed several games, products and in-game events that are all arriving for the 35<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Super Mario Bros. This includes games new to the Nintendo Switch family of systems like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, a collection of three <em>Super Mario</em> games of the modern era: Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy; Super Mario Bros. 35, a 35-player online battle in the world of the original Super Mario Bros<em>.</em>; and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, an enhanced version of Super Mario 3D World<em></em>which originally launched on Wii U.</p>
