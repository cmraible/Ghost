Mary Kirby who writes [Runway Girl](http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/runway-girl/), one of Flight Global’s blogs, has decided to turn her hand to vlogging, with a news round-up on video.\n\n<object height=\"295\" width=\"480\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/gcB6qFh6m2k&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"295\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/gcB6qFh6m2k&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\"></embed></object>\n\nIt’s a nice first effort. If I were to add constructive criticism, I’d recommend a few more pictures as well as the talking head shots, but nearly 500 views already is not bad going.\n\nFeel free to give [Mary some feedback](http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/runway-girl/2009/01/video-lets-get-it-started.html). \n\n\n"
