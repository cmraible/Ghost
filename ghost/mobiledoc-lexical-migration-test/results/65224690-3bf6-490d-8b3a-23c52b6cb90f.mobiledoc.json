The back tires have no problem climbing up the sloping front end of the Corvette, crushing the windshield as the poor Chevy driver was sitting inside. Fortunately the guy in the ‘Vette wasn’t hurt, but that might have been thanks to his smart thinking as he climbed into the passenger seat as the Pilot kept mountain goating his ride."

Hopefully insurance covers everything, but the Chevy driver thinks he perhaps can’t find parts. We know car parts are a little interesting these days, but it’s not like he has some super rare, exotic ride. But he might just be better off buying a different one considering how much damage was done."
