<p>Finding untouched preserved beauties is something everyone is fond of, but creating custom cruisers is a great way to keep the classic styles on the road and still have some fun behind the wheel with some modern performance. The pre-WWII rides have awesome lines and looks, but driving them reminds you of how far technology has come.</p>
