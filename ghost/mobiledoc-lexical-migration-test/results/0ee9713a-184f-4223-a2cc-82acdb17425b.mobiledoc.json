How about a no-nonsense interior, a Police handling package, and a set of 15x6 Black H.D. wheels wrapped in reproduction G70x15 Redline tires just as it was intended."

Buy your tickets here, and you could be taking home this true dream car and the $15,000 cash to cover the taxes. How much you donate is completely up to you. You can donate $3.00 or $5,000.00 but it is worth noting that donating more means more entries and possibly more good karma, as all donations directly benefit New Beginning Children’s Homes which in turn supports seven other charities. Together, these fantastic charities help make the lives of children, DUI victims, veterans, the homeless, and breast cancer victims better in turn making America an even better place."
