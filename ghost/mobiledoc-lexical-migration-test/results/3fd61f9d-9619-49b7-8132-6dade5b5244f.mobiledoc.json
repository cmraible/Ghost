At the heart of this beast is a fuel-injected Ford 392 cubic-inch V-8 paired to a three-speed C6 automatic transmission and beefed up Ford nine-inch axles with welded trusses. Add in the custom roll cage, four-wheel disc brakes and the four-link rear suspension, and this monster Bronco is ready to tackle any terrain."

After all, who would want to scratch those 17-inch wheels or mess up the beautiful Blue Lagoon Metallic paint job? This Bronco is equally proficient at cruising and showing with a rain-resistant interior, removable soft and hard tops and cushy bucket seats with five-point harnesses. Not only will the Bronco Dream Giveaway grand prize winner get this pulse-pounding custom Bronco, he or she will also get an additional $8,000 to cover taxes!"
