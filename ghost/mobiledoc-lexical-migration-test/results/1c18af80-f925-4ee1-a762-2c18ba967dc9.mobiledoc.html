<hr>
<p>If you’re wanting a cool, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevelle-races-nissan-skyline/">fast</a>, but not too-flashy boat, might we suggest taking a look at this RB30 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/900-hp-nissan-r34/">Skyline GT-R-powered</a> jetboat. For sale in New Zealand, it’s quite the build. Unlike the notorious <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/zr48-corvette-boat/">ZR48 Corvette boat we covered as it outran the cops</a>, this thing flies more under the radar.</p>
<blockquote><em>Watch an R34 GT-R play in Tokyo <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/900-hp-nissan-r34/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Sure, the boat looks nice and it’ll definitely impress your friends, but it’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-r32-skyline-r35-gt-r/">little bit of a sleeper</a>. According to the owner, the hull was built by Tony Ward (formerly Kwikcraft). As you can see from the photos, the two-tone gray and silver appearance is nice, but there’s nothing indicating something wild lurks under the engine cover in the rear. At 15.5 feet long, the boat is a good size for a nice time out on the water.</p>

<p>This RB30 has been built and tuned to increase displacement to 3.4 liters. There’s a long list of everything done to this engine, from a 3.4L Spool Billet 94mm Crank installed to a Borg Warner 9180 EFR turbo bolted up. It’s clear the owner put a lot of time and money into this project, something he says has taken over 10 years to complete. Why he’s willing to part with it after all that isn’t clear.</p>

<p>With all those upgrades, this engine puts out some pretty solid figures, as you might imagine. Using a dyno, as they even show in the video, this boat is pushing 914-horsepower and 791 lb.-ft. of torque. As you’ll also see, that power lets the boat go from cruising at a nice speed to absolutely ripping through the water, sending a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/zr48-corvette-boat/">nice rooster tail</a> behind.</p>

<p>According to the listing, the engine has only been used on about 10 outings on the water, so it should be pretty solid. The owner includes a photo of his Nissan Skyline GT-R hooked up to the boat trailer. Has he used Godzilla to tow his Godzilla-powered boat? If so, that’s pretty wild and bold.</p>
