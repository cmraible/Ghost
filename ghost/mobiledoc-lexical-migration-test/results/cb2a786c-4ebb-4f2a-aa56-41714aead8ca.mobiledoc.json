We don’t think anyone saw that coming. And while that might seem like an uneven matchup, we have to say the Nissan is heavily modified, so it might stand a chance."

Channeling that to the tires is a GR6 six-speed transmission. The R35 is wearing a carbon-fiber skin to help what’s normally a portly thing tip the scale at 3,750 lbs., so that’s not too bad considering all the mods."

You can see those massive twin turbos and intake, thanks to there being no hood present, plus a nice 427ci LSX V8 with all the trimmings. That setup is supposedly good for 1,500-hp, but we suspect it might be a littler more. Backing that up is a drag race friendly three-speed transmission. However, this pickup is a little bit more on the heavier side at 4,000 lbs. Usually it’s GT-Rs that have such a disadvantage."
