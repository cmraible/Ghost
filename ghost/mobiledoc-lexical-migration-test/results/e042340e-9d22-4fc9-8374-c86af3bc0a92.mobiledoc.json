          " is a road trip, taken on an old car with a loud and chaotic group of friends while the GPS isn’t working. It’s fun, high energy and you really feel like you got to know interesting people and places throughout. The negatives are less downfalls and more minor speed bumps along the way on a voyage that was funny, touching, serious and terribly engaging; a voyage that I was happy to take, and anyone that appreciates creativity and character-driven stories will be more than satisfied by."
