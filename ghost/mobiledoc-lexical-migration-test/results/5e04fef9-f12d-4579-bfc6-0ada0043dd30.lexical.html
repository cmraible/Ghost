<hr>
<p>Most people wouldn’t consider an old <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImNoZXZyb2xldCIsImMxMCJdfQ==">Chevy C10</a> to be a threat on the drag strip, so seeing one lined up against a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-r35-c6-corvette/">Nissan GT-R R35</a> seems like some sort of joke. Well, we didn’t bring out a joke of a race for you to watch, that’s for sure, because the classic pickup truck seems to be quite divergent from factory spec, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modified-silverado-boasts-big-power/">if you catch our drift</a>.</p>

<p>That’s what can make races at the local drag strip so fun and unpredictable. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sleeper-chevy-c10/">Sleepers</a> absolutely exist and they crave embarrassing people behind the wheel of some flashy performance car like an R35 Nissan GT-R. After all, everyone who knows anything about modern vehicles is aware <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-r32-skyline-r35-gt-r/">Godzilla</a> is built to be incredibly fast, often destroying opponents off the line with the super-advanced all-wheel-drive system before gapping them all the way to the finish line.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of the video it’s obvious the Chevrolet C10 isn’t the least bit stock. Sure, it’s still a rear-wheel-drive truck, but we’d be willing to bet it’s not running the factory engine. While there’s no way to know for absolutely sure, there’s a good chance this pickup is an LS swap. From the sound of it, the truck is also running a performance cam. If you crank the volume you can really hear the burble and it’s wonderful.</p>
<p>Just from the sound of the truck, it’s obvious this Godzilla has perhaps met its match. Even though it’s a powerful Japanese supercar, the R35 is a pretty heavy car. And while the onboard technologies make launching it cleanly pretty easy, we’ve seen drivers screw up and not have a great start. If the driver of the C10 is skilled and has good reflexes, the lightweight construction of the pickup could give it the edge to blow the R35 out of the water.</p>
<p>This race certainly didn’t go the way we were expecting, but you just have to see it for yourself.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H_LoC8-kRU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
