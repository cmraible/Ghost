Those cars were purchased in 2005 by known Japanese Ferrari collector, Yoshiyuki Hayashi. In 2007 Zagato was back at it again, this time redesigning the bodywork for a 599 GTB. From that point forward the fresh new style, called the 599 GTZ Nibbio, was available in both the coupe and Spyder body types. The cars came with a customized paint job and a sharp angular design to help the cars stand out from the rest."
