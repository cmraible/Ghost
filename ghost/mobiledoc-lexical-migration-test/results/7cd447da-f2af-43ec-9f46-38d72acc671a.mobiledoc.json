The car comes with two sets of doors, one set of fiberglass doors as well as the original set of doors with push pin installation - this makes for quick and easy installation whenever you want to switch doors. The gigantic scoop on the hood is not just for looks, it houses the massive 4-bbl carb and gives the car a scary aggressive look."

Every inch of this car holds the weight of years of hard work giving this car an unbeatable personality. It is impressive to see that Fiorelli knows everything there is to know about this car, which shows that he cares about this car and that he was very invested in the building process.
