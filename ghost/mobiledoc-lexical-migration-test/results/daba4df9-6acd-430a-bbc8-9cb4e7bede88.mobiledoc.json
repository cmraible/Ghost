While cars have been a huge target in the past few years (a problem which started before the pandemic ever started, just to clarify) it seems now criminals have fixed their sites on the lucrative radio control car market. That’s right, several were swiped from the Kamloops Summer Classic event held in British Columbia over the weekend of June 24-26."

Or maybe they just wanted to come up with a sick build and they like stealing stuff. Whatever the reason, we don’t advocate stealing cars of any type, including of the RC persuasion. The only thing that was missing from this heist was a high-speed police pursuit."
