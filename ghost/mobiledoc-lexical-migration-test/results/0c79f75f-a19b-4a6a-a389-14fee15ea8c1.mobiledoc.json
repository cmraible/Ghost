In stock form, they’re pretty tame cars, which is why they’re the perfect platform for a sleeper build. That’s exactly what we have from Nick’s Garage and this Belvedere is a real tire roasting torque monster we think you’ll love."

The paint is far from perfect, there are unfinished panels welded to the hood, and the interior features such niceties as split upholstery and the vinyl on the steering wheel peeling off. If you were trying to sell this ride online and wanted to put a positive spin on things you would call it mostly original, only mechanically it’s anything but."

A lot of people aren’t as familiar with these experimental homologation cars since they weren’t anywhere near as successful as the Charger Daytonas and Plymouth Superbirds. They’re also pretty rare, with people debating if it was 392 or some other number near that, which is partly why people get confused about what they are and what they’re all about."
