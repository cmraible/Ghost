<p>Corvettes typically look like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/vicaris-latest-auction-highlights/">other Corvettes</a>. There's a clear evolution from one body style into the next. Even <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-this-2020-corvette-and-support-a-good-cause/">the C8</a> looks just enough like a C7 to share in that family resemblance.</p>

<p>In this case, though, the Corvette seen here doesn't look anything like any other Corvette. That's because every body panel, save for the roof, has been replaced or re-sculpted.</p>
<p>Back in 2005, California custom shop No 2 Alike (N2A) removed the body panels from a then-new Corvette and transformed it into the Anteros. The result is a car that looks vaguely European.</p>

<p>The varied mix of styling cues evoke Maserati, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/richard-hammonds-ferrari/">Ferrari</a>, and perhaps a bit of Jaguar. The end result looks like a car you could buy or steal in Grand Theft Auto 5 â€“ a car that looks sort of like other cars, but not enough for any one manufacturer to unleash their legal team.</p>
<p>Originally, this custom creation sold for $150,000. Now, it can be yours for less than $58,000. We have to admit that it's not an unattractive car by any stretch. The dark blue color is stunning, especially paired with the light tan interior. It's a classy color combo.</p>

<p>The problem, for us, is that underneath that one-of-a-kind bodywork, it's a base C6 underneath. There's nothing wrong with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/48-hour-camaro/">an LS3</a>, of course, but we just expect a bit more for our money when we're buying $60,000 worth of sports car. That's especially true considering that the car has an automatic transmission and no real pedigree.</p>
<p>Still, it's an impressive piece of work, and we're sure that the next owner will be happy with it. If you're so inclined, you can find it on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/338962433807102">Facebook Marketplace</a> near Chicago, Illinois.</p>
