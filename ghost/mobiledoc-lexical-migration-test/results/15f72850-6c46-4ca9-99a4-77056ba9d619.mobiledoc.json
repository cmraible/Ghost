The Aintree Green Metallic paint job is the perfect color for this British off-roader, but inside is where this rig really shines with quilted leather throughout. This luxury interior is also fitted with a custom sound system and navigation system, and to keep your gear secure, there's also a locking center console and a locking storage drawer topped with diamond plate for added durability and style."

Pictures show this Land Rover blasting through powder snow and perched atop an overlook with a rooftop camper, and all that's missing for its next adventure is a new owner. Speaking of pictures, the gallery also shows the extensive restoration that this Land Rover underwent."
