And we know what this weekend brings, don’t we?\n\nEurovision.\n\nNow, we might be lacking Terry Wogan this year, so can I recommend a whole different kind of coverage for you? Mr Ewan Spence, a mad Scotsman whom I’ve run around New York and Paris with (but never anywhere in the UK, strangely), is over in Moscow reporting on the thing, in an online, new-media kind of way. In fact, he’s been doing so all week, so you can head over to his site to get your preparation done for [tomorrow night’s Eurovision extravaganza](http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/category/conferences/2009/eurovision-2009/).\n\nAnd just to whet your appetite, here’s his 50 Fun Facts about the Eurovision:\n\n<object height=\"385\" width=\"480\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/PlxX9shBPck&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/PlxX9shBPck&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\"></embed>  \n**  \nObligatory Journalism Content: **What I find really interesting about watching Euan’s stuff is the completely different level of involvement you get from watching a genuine enthusiast cover an event they are passionate and knowledgeable about, as opposed to the “skating the surface” mainstream coverage. Around an event like the Eurovision, the main broadcast is in real danger of becoming just a social object that people interact about elsewhere.    \n</object>\n\n\n"
