<hr>
<p>With the weather warming up and the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/covid-19-survivor-saved/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> winding down, now’s the time to finally get out of the house and enjoy some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/21st-annual-riding-into-history/">automotive gatherings</a>. While there are far too many to list off here, the following three events are some of the largest and most interesting coming up in the next few months.</p>

<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-amelia-island-concours-delegance/">Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance</a> will be held again this year. The high-end automotive event snuck through in March of last year, before restrictions were put in place in Florida as well as pretty much everywhere else in the United States, so it technically hasn’t been disrupted by COVID-19. This year the event will be held May 20-23 where attendees can see plenty of eye candy at the Ritz-Carlton as over 300 rare vehicles and their owners will flock from around the globe. Auctions, car test drives, and formal dinners make this quite the event to attend, if you have the chance.</p>
<p>Organizers for the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance aren’t taking chances when it comes to the virus. They’re being upfront about the requirement for all guests ages 2 and up to wear a face covering. Failure to adhere to the facility/event rules could lead to you being ejected, so know that before attending.</p>

<p>After it was canceled last year, Monterey Car Week in Monterey, California will come <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/petersen-virtual-car-week/">roaring back</a> this August 6-15. This huge automotive gathering has a little bit of something for everyone, whether you’re into high-end pre-war classics, American muscle cars, motorsports, or whatever else. Automakers will be in attendance to show off their latest concepts and production models.</p>
<p>Some of the best Monterey Car Week action takes place at Laguna Seca. Vintage race cars take on the track’s notorious turns, including the famous corkscrew, which is exciting for spectators of all ages. But the capstone event is the much-lauded <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pebble-beach-wants-memories/">Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance</a> where the cream of the crop classic cars gather to compete for the coveted title of Best in Show. People also dress to the nines for the event, often matching the time period and country of origin for their ride.</p>
