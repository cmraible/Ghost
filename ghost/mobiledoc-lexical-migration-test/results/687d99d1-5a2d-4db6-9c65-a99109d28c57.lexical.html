<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/179018/2009-dodge-challenger-drag-pak">This 2009 Dodge Challenger Drag Pak</a>, purchased out of the Tyson Collection (1 of 25 offerings that were sold) in North Carolina, presents a unique opportunity to purchase not only very rare and exclusive Mopar sheetmetal, but one that is untouched and as delivered from the factory. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/craigslist-find-1979-dodge-lil-red-express-hemi/">Dodge</a> built 100 of these cars solely for sanctioned racing as a package car for stock and super stock series, and this particular car is number 83 built for the 2009 model year. Buyers were provided with a motor and race-prepped, non-street legal shell, but the rest is up to the buyer for completion. Therefore, most of these Drag Pak cars have gone on to see the intended use they were built for, making 1/4 mile passes, so finding a car with this kind of pedigree that is still as the factory delivered in a body-in-white finish is certainly rare.</p>

This is a 1 owner car that was built for the CEO of HPP. As such it has several unique features and was used to develop certain Mopar products that are still in use today.

It was the first 5.7 L Hemi car to get a Magnuson Supercharger and was the first control car for the calibration for the Magnuson Kit It is serial number 003 of the cars built by HPP.</p>
