Also, the engine was making some odd noises. So, after fixing what was wrong with it, a technician took it out to ensure everything was working fine. He certainly tested out the acceleration issue in an extreme way, so it seems to have been fixed. However, he could’ve crashed the Corvette and/or caused a serious, possibly even a fatal accident."
