Enzo was supposedly in Scaglietti's ear telling him to jump ship on this Corvette project. And this may have stemmed Carroll Shelby's famous quote, \"Ferrari's ass is mine!\". The General Manager of Chevrolet at the time, Ed Cole, called Shelby in the early hours of the morning and said that the project would be no longer. This lit a fire within Carroll Shelby, and he eventually went on to beat Ferrari in 1964 with his Shelby Cobra."
