This is where the fingerprint is screen printed onto the hood and then a clear coat is added, but before getting to this step, the fingerprint is \"processed\" to make sure there are no security issues with plastering your biometric data for all to see. German customers need to pony up 7,500 euros, which is about $8,100 USD, for this custom option, but specific pricing has yet to be announced for other markets."
