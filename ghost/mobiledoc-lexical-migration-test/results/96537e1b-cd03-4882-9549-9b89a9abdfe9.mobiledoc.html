<p>Ever since <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/speedkore-dodge-charger/">Mopar</a> announced the Hellephant crate engine, people have been going nuts over them. That’s easy to understand considering supercharged 426ci V8 cranks out 1,000-horsepower and 950 lb.-ft. of torque. It sold out quickly with rumors that about 100 were made, but nobody seems to know for sure how many there are. Anyway, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/speedkore-demon/">SpeedKore</a> out of Wisconsin was one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/robert-downey-bmw/">lucky few</a> to get one of these beasts to play with in a 1970 Dodge Charger and has released footage of the muscle car on a dyno.</p>

<p>One video is brief but lets you hear what the Hellephant sounds like at idle and it’s pretty intimidating. We would love if all muscle cars sounded that way, but some neighbors of muscle car owners would get all worked up over that.</p>

<p>Then there’s the video of the ’70 Charger doing a dyno pull. The engine and exhaust sound even better under load with nothing even hinting at shrillness, just good American muscle baritone to make your heart sing. Seriously, this car should strike fear in the hearts of lesser vehicles, which is a long list.</p>
<p>Not much is known about this Dodge Charger, but it does wear a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/speedkore-dodge-demon/">carbon-fiber body</a> for even more of a performance boost. SpeedKore has also revealed it bolted a ZF 8HP90 8-speed automatic transmission. Since the work of tuning this muscle car hasn’t been completed no figures from the dyno have been released. We can pretty confidently say it will be a healthy amount over 900-hp at the wheels. That kind of power combined with a low curb weight should make this Mopar formidable on the drag strip, depending on what other modifications might be installed.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a few other Hellephant builds, like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-defector-hellephant/">brief video</a> RingBrothers released of Defector, a 1969 Dodge Charger with the crate engine and other modifications. Someone has also swapped a Hellephant <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-how-much-power-a-supercar-destroying-hellephant-swapped-dodge-demon-makes/">into a Demon</a>. We can’t wait to see this SpeedKore Charger in action hopefully soon.</p>
