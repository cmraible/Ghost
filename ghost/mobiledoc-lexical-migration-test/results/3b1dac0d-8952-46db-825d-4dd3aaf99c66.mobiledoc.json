Reportedly, a friend of the famous comedians, who are both huge gearheads, say they’re being treated like the “MS-13 of Malibu” as the landlords have called in the police to clear the car enthusiasts."

What changed was all the government-imposed lockdown measures in California. With people bored out of their ever-living minds, word spread of the low-key gathering and the crowd ballooned to the point the landlords decided it was a nuisance."

After all, the beaches were shut down and all sorts of other ridiculous measures. But what was an intimate gathering of Porsche enthusiasts in the area exploded into a circus of just about every type of gearhead, including the most annoying out there."

That’s understandable, but the situation apparently was so bad the landlords felt compelled to next call the police. One has to wonder if some more innovative measures could have alleviated the problems, but without all the details of the situation that’s an impossible question to answer thoroughly."

It’s almost like government intervention often comes with unintended consequences nobody likes."

Instead, it’s guys who show up, don’t patronize any of the business, then hang out for hours on end with their hood raised. Unfortunately, that means those who aren’t part of the problem are getting treated like they are."
