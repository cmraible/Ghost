In the lineup, you'll find a plethora of rear-wheel drive, rear-engine, and high-powered supercars, which lay down some of the world's fastest times on tracks across the globe. One such model is the Carrera GT which utilizes a very sleek and low-slung nature to deliver one of the most brutal and raw driving experiences available on the supercar market. Speeds of over 200 mph are elementary to achieve when driving a car like this because of the dedicated German engineering and design which produced vehicles like the 911 and 918. Of course, you'll just have to see for yourself how unique these cars can really be.",

Of only 1,270 cars produced, this one is number 793, making it a very rare supercar and something you definitely don't see every day. Along with the incredibly low production numbers, this particular car boasts one of the most desirable interior colors on the market. While we're not sure how many came with this distinction, we do know that the Terracotta leather that wraps the inside is an infrequent option. That's precisely why this car is estimated at around $1million. Of course, that is hardly something to scoff at, but this supercar is soon to be a classic in a few years which means that the value is sure to only go up from here. This is the perfect car for any enthusiast looking to invest in something that will keep its value for decades to come while still giving you the sort of harrowing driving experience that only a German supercar can provide.",
