<p>Do you remember when we recently spoke about two indie Kickstarter games: Tem Tem and Steamboat Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan? Well, they’ve both been successfully funded and are coming to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Both titles are due to release in 2019 and we can’t wait to hear more about them. If any more big news drops on these games, we’ll be sure to keep you informed.</p>
<p>Tem Tem’s campaign is actually still running, so if you’d like to back it and ensure yourself a copy, you can!</p>
