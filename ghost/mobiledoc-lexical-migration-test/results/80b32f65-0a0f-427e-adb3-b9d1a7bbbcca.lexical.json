Hiring <a href=\"https://www.thinkingheads.com/en/personal-reputation/\">online reputation management services </a>is especially useful for important figures in businesses or in a particular area.</p>\n<p>In any case, being aware of how to manage your reputation is absolutely essential for professional success.  So here are five tips on creating and maintaining a positive online reputation:</p>\n<h3>1.  Monitoring is an important first step</h3>\n<p>First of all, become aware of <strong>how you or your company are seen on the Internet right now</strong>. This will direct you on how to proceed.</p>\n<p>You can have an idea of your company&#8217;s online image by googling your brand’s name. Remember that 90% of all search engine users never click on the second page of results, so <strong>the first set of results</strong> represents the majority of online reputation management activities.</p>\n<p>We recommend setting up <strong>Google Alerts</strong> for both the company name and your own name. These will keep you informed when a new online entry emerges.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-48916 size-full\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720.png 960w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720-300x225.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720-768x575.png 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720-600x449.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720-610x457.png 610w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720-632x474.png 632w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2017/07/analytics-1925495_960_720-536x402.png 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></p>\n<h3>2.  Defend your territory</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next step is to make sure you have <strong>control over all the domains</strong> associated with your company name.</p>\n<p>Suppose your small business is called Lázaro Repairs. Most likely, the sites that get the highest ratings when your business is directed to Google are: reparacioneslázaro.com, .org and .net.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is important that as a user you are the owner of the rights of these sites. Go to a domain registration page and <strong>purchase the rights of all domains associated with your brand</strong>.</p>\n<p>You may not use them all, but they can redirect to the company&#8217;s home page. Also, be sure to register all social network identifiers and associated custom URLs.</p>\n<h3>3.  Distribute content</h3>\n<p>The best way to ensure that search engines reveal positive information about your brand is to <strong>feed them with positive content</strong>.</p>\n<p>Search engines favor useful and attractive content. So, by launching and maintaining a good <strong>business blog</strong>, you can flood Google with articles worthy of rank and present your business in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>Being <strong>active on social media </strong>is probably necessary. What happens when negative content appears on search engines? There&#8217;s no way to remove unwanted content from Google, but you can skip it.</p>\n<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s best to duplicate the creation of high-ranking content, to fill the search results on the first page.</p>\n<h3>4.  When it comes to reviewing sites</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next step for small businesses is to set up profiles on <strong>relevant reviewing sites</strong>, such as: Yelp.com, Urban Spoon or TripAdvisor.com.</p>\n<p>You may not want to get an avalanche of online reviews. However, you’ll get them sooner or later, whether you like it or not. By proactively setting up your own profiles, you can ensure that your company&#8217;s information is entered accurately.</p>\n<p>When user <strong>reviews and criticisms </strong>begin to appear, be sure to <strong>thank them</strong> for their positive comments and even for their constructive criticisms.</p>\n<p>Avoid responding to cyber defamers. Responding to these reviews gives them greater visibility. It&#8217;s better if your content creation efforts speak for you.</p>\n<h3>5.  Object-relational mapping (ORM) for companies</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that no small business owner can afford to ignore online reputation management.</p>\n<p>What the Internet search and reviewing websites say about your business is of <strong>great importance</strong> to consumers, potential employees and even venture capitalists.</p>\n<p><strong>Final scoop:</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly, what we publish online can have a<strong> real impact </strong>on our business. The cost of having a poor reputation in e-commerce leads to lower conversions, lower rates if you&#8217;re a professional delivering consulting and so forth. The opposite is true for maintaining a good reputation. It is not maintained by publishing fake news, but rather through excellent customer care, responsiveness and by following the rules of the game as outlined above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
