Supposedly, the setup doesn’t involve internal swaps in the engine and is good for somewhere around 650- to 800-horsepower. In other words, it’s probably making more like 1,000-hp and has all kinds of extra goodies shoved in there."

Since this race is a rolling start, the donk has a little less of a disadvantage, otherwise that Aventador SV with its rather advanced all-wheel-drive system would just smoke it off the line."
