<p>Remember the end of Gone In 60 Seconds when Nicolas Cage's character drives off in the "heap" of a Shelby? If you have the kind of vision of Memphis Raines, then this <a href="https://www.2smotorcars.com/vehicles/49/1967-ford-mustang?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1967 Ford Mustang Fastback project car</a> is for you.</p>

<p>Sure, this Mustang is a little rough around the edges, but with the exception of some needed rust repair and front seats, this project is complete. The current owner already replaced the front floor boards, but there is still some rust left in the body â€“ "in the typical Mustang areas" according to the listing. The rear seat and most of the trim pieces come with the car. Despite the condition of the body, the chrome pieces (bumper, grille and taillights) all seem to be in great shape.</p>
<p>Being a C-code Mustang, this car came with the 289 CID V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor, although it's unclear if this is the original engine. As they say, this car ran before being parked. The engine is backed by a C4 three-speed automatic transmission, and the car has front disc brakes. This '67 Mustang is being sold by <a href="https://www.2smotorcars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2S Motorcars</a> for $14,950, and while that's already a good price for a promising project, you can also make an offer <strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/172461/1967-ford-mustang">HERE</a></strong>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of restored Mustang Fastbacks currently selling for well over $30,000, but if you wanted to get a little crazier, this could make for a killer restomod. At that point, too, you're just a Dark Highland Green or Silver with Black racing stripes paint job away from a Bullitt replica or an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/genuine-eleanor-mustang">Eleanor</a> knockoff, which could net you even more in the end. The sky definitely is the limit when you start with a car like this!</p>
