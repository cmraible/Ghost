<p>For the last twelve months, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-redeye-hearse/">Dodge Hellcats</a> have quickly made their way to the center of the spotlight, and not for the best reasons either. They might account for <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/hellcat?promo=MOTORIOUS9">some of the fastest production cars</a> around, but they make their way in front of us for two reasons: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-driver-loses-control/">They get wrecked</a>, and they get stolen - <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">sometimes both</a>! Since we're in the mood for some automotive carnage, we decided to check out the inventory at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-wrecked-c8s-of-copart/">Copart</a>, and it yielded many results. Here are some interesting ones.</p>

<p>I want to know who dropped this off at Copart, and I mean names! This listing is a real head scratcher, and my head is now a lot more scratched than <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-dodge-redeye/">this Redeye</a>. With a little over 1,600 miles on it, the widebody <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1971-hellcat-cuda/">Hellcat</a> Redeye is listed as having 'minor dents and scratches', and that's overstating it.</p>

<p>On the other end of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/315829/barely-driven-redeye">the Redeye world</a>, we go from 'What is this doing here?' to 'Whoa, what happened?' with this 2019. This Redeye is even missing the widebody fender flares, and the damage is listed as 'all over', no kidding. You might get a pair of backseats out of this Hellcat, but it's hard to even say if those are completely intact.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind here, is '<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-mazda-rx-7/">engine swap time</a>!' when looking at this Hellcat. Since Dodge is ramming Hellcat engines into everything it can get its hands on, why not find a minivan and slam this sucker in? Or perhaps, a nice vintage truck?</p>

<p>Most of us haven't even seen a 2020 Charger <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-dodge-charger-hellcat-widebody/">Hellcat widebody</a> in person, so it's extra painful to see one wrecked. Everything from the cowl back looks pretty good, and the engine likely runs, but it's too bad this beauty's good looks are tarnished with a totally fowled up front end.</p>

<p>This Hellcat <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sheriff-uses-dodge-charger-hellcat/">Charger</a> is stripped down pretty far, so it's hard to tell what happened to the rest of the car. The Charger was either stripped after damage, or was stolen and stripped, either way, it hurts to see this proud muscle car plopped on the ground like this.</p>

<p>At fist glance, it was hard to see what was wrong with this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-hellcat-thieves/">Charger Hellcat</a>, but second glance, it's bad, real bad. Obviously in a rollover, this Charger has very severe rear damage, but that Hellcat engine looks totally fine. </p>
