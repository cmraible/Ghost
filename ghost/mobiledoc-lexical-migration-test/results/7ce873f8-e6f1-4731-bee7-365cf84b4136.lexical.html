<hr>
<p>Bob Regehr made a name for himself by inventing the Moon-Walk bounce house, but automotive enthusiasts might recognize his name due to the massive classic car collection he amassed over the years. At one point, his collection surpassed 200 vehicles, but by the time of his death last September, this number sat at around 140. </p>
<p>On October 24, 2020, all of these vehicles will be auctioned off at the Kansas State Fairgrounds marking the first time many of these cars have been seen by the public in decades.</p>

<p>According to a report from <em>KWCH</em>, Regehr has been collecting cars since he was 14 years old, and as you can see in the photo above, one of his favorites was the '32 Ford â€“ he owned 20 examples of this car! His collection was featured by Hot Rod magazine back in April 2009, and it spans from cars as old as the 1928 Ford Model A up to the newest car of the bunch, a 1986 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/el-camino-rendering/">Chevrolet El Camino</a>. American muscle cars and hot rods definitely make up the bulk of the collection, but he also owned a 1973 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1978-jaguar-xjs-trans-am-racer/">Jaguar XJ</a>6, 1979 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1982-ferrari-magnum-pi/">Ferrari 308</a> GTS, a 1970 Suzuki motorcycle and a 1976 Honda CJ360 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/motorcycle/">motorcycle</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to his bounce house business, Regehr also owned three Texaco service stations, which his daughter said usually lead him to make offers on cool cars that were stopping in for gas. One of the coolest vehicles he collected was a 1955 Chevrolet Cameo pickup truck that he bought unexpectedly while traveling through Colorado.</p>
