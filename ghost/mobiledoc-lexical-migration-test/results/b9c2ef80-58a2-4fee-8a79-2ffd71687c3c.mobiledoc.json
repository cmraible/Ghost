          "We completely get why Rick Ross wants to own a fire engine because we have the same fantasy. Sure, owning some classic muscle cars, modern exotic supercars, and luxury trucks would be fun, but all of those don’t hold a candle to a classic fire truck. It’s the ultimate toy, a thing most of us if we’re being honest have dreamed of owning but the reality of storing and maintaining such a thing dashed the illusion."

He always wanted to ride in one but never got the chance. Now that he owns one he not only gets to ride on one, he can drive it whenever he wants."

Painted on the sides is “Caution K-9” and “Promised Land Estate Patrol” with a crest and “No Trespassing.” Maybe he’ll buy a garbage truck or a street sweeper next? Or he could snag a mail truck?"

We’re honestly surprised more celebrity gearheads aren’t buying these kinds of vehicles for their collection. It’s still a dream of ours to follow in Ross’ footsteps, maybe not by owning 100-plus cars but at least by adding a fire truck to our own collection."
