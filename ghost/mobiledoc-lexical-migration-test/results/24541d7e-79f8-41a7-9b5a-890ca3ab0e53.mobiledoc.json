Funny enough, when the current owner got this car, it was already built quite a bit with modifications like a supercharger, roll cage, rear seat delete, etc. Instead of just settling for what he had, the guy wanted to take the car to the next level, or more accurately up several levels."

Backing that up is a GM 4L80-E transmission and Currie Turn 9 Pro-Touring rear with 3.73 gears."

To help keep this Nova on the straight and narrow, there’s a Detroit Speed front and rear suspension with UniSteer rack and pinion. You’ll note the wheels are nice and tucked, so the rear are tubbed and have 345/30-R19 tires on them with plenty of clearance. And peeking through the wheel spokes are Baer brakes with 6-piston calipers up front paired with 14-inch drilled and slotted rotors."
