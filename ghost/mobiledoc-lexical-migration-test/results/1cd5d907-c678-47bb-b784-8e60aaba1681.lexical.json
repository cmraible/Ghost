Some dislike the cars for its distinct performance while others see the vehicles as underrated and deserving of a lot more recognition for its positive attributes. One point out that, contrary to popular belief, this generation was the first Corvette to use a dual-overhead-camshaft design. On top of that, some of these cars have been built into some crazy drag racers making them iconic to a special few who recognize the greatness within the car. This particular vehicle is a great example of everything that made these cars great while still keeping up in today’s high-performance world.",
