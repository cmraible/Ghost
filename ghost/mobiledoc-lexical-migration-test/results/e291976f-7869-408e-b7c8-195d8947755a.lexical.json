Indeed, may have been well made but overtime frames rust when not taken proper care of. So the owner got hard at work creating the perfect test that would showcase the strength, or lack thereof, of a rusty old pick up truck frame. Typically, at least when dealing with new cars, you might use a test dummy or specifically made device that measures forces like gravity and impact. However that’s just not how things are done in this modern world of DIY YouTubers.",

It’s actually really surprising to look at how that particular test turned out because at the speed he was going he might’ve expected a little more than a small dent on the rear bumper. What actually happened was that the entire truck folded into perfectly showcasing why you should always inspect your vehicle's chassis before you go off road.",
