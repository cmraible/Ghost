<p>As ground breaking and innovative as Chevy’s <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Blazer">K5 Blazer</a> was, it would be hard to believe the designers at GM would have ever thought up anything like this 1972 K5 Blazer built by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/its-time-for-a-ringbrothers-sale/">Ringbrothers</a>. Completely stripped all the way down to bare frame, which was then boxed and reinforced in many places, the blazer was fully rebuilt and essentially redesigned to look as though it came that way from the factory. </p>

<p>The end result-the most coveted K5 Blazer ever to be sold on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1971-jaguar-e-type-v12-auction/">Bring A Trailer</a> with a final sale price of $300,000. Ringbrothers, an award-winning shop, is renowned for its custom builds. Utilizing everything in their restoration arsenal from composite bodywork to machined aluminum accessories and they held nothing back from this project.</p>

<p>Its custom body, finished in BASF Glasurit Waterborne Black paint, features a unique carbon fiber “cowl-induction” hood with vents that add a menacing look and insinuates to an unruly power plant below. Earning that title is a 350 cubic-inch ZZ430 V8 engine backed by a Bowler Performance four-speed automatic transmission and topped with a Holley Dominator fuel injection system. A Flowmaster exhaust system fine tunes a distinctive note.</p>

<p>Bringing the interior up to modern times with a truly retro feel, Ringbrothers fitted the dash with an integrated Alpine touchscreen stereo, a Vintage Air climate control system, Dakota Digital HDX-series instrumentation, and a bevy of machined-in-house aluminum components. A blue <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevrolet-impala-1958-2020/">Chevrolet</a> horn button adorns the blue four-spoke steering wheel for a perfect match to the blue vinyl with houndstooth inserts and blue carpeting. The digital odometer, reading only 450 miles, neighboring the analog clock really says it all. Modern functionality perfectly paired with timeless style. </p>
