<p>You know the car. Quirky and unique from the start, it's role in the Back to the Future series made it a pop culture icon. No Flux Capacitor here, so the combination of 1.21 gigawatts and hitting 88mph won't take you back in time, or send you to the future. It will however get loads of attention and look great parked in your garage.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1991-bmw-m5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Production of the second generation BMW M5 was from 1989 to 1995. The code named E34 Gen used the S38; a 3.6-liter straight six cylinder engine making an incredible 310 bhp. Production of M5 models began with the painted shell of an E34 5 Series at the BMW Dingolfing plant. The shells were then transported to BMW M GmbH in Garching, where the car was assembled by hand over a period of two weeks. E34 BMW M5's have long been difficult to find in this condition. Most of these cars have seen regular use or play from aggressive drivers over the years, making <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/167433/1991-bmw-m5">this a rare specimen</a>.</p>

<p>Third-generation Camaros are definitely making a huge splash on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/future-collector-car-market/">collector car market</a>.

<p>There is no doubt that the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/185235/1996-dodge-viper-gts">Gen II Viper GTS</a> is an American Performance Icon. No, they aren't easy to drive and they will certainly keep a novice in check. 1996 was the first year for significant improvement to the iconic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-vipers-on-motorious/">Viper</a>, adding comfort features and more power.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1991-acura-nsx.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/163695/1991-acura-nsx">This 1991 Acura NSX</a> with just 62,352 original miles almost looks like it just rolled off the showroom floor. A lot of folks think of the NSX as a Japanese Ferrari, but I think that does the NSX a grave disservice. If you look at it, it's really like nothing else before or since, with a radical cab-forward design that was expressly made to resemble a fighter jet's canopy.</p>
