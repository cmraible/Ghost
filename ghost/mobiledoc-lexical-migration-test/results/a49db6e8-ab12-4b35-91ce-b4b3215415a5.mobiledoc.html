<p>You may have just expanded your farm to the third section, walked up to the newest buildings and seen that they require Orichalcum Ingots and thought to yourself, "how do I get that?". I know this because I thought the same thing. That was until I found three ways on how to mine Orichalcum Ore but I think it goes without saying that you're going to need an upgraded Hammer (preferably Gold), a high Mining level (which you probably have if you're looking to mine Orichalcum) and some food to keep your stamina high for Method One.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/3324894/1309898/15385" target="_top" id="1309898"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15385-1309898" border="0" alt width="728" height="90" /></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/3324894/1309898/15385" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" /><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<h3 id="method-one">Method One</h3>
<p>The first time I found Orichalcum Ore was at the bottom five levels in the third mine, stretching from B46-B50 - the latter will always be a single room with a ladder and one Orichalcum rock.</p>

<p>Mines will warn you about falling down the pits however, they're a good way to skip a few levels. Although, <em>only</em> do this if you have some food handy as it can drain your Stamina meter quickly. I also discourage falling into pits from levels B35 onward as you don't want to accidentally miss any levels B46+ if you're mining for Orichalcum.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-29.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1170" height="658" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-29.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-29.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-29.png 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>You'll also want to start this underground venture in the early hours of the morning as it may take you a long time to reach the bottom. You can bring all the food you want but if 2am hits and you're still working your way down, it's back to bed for you!</p>
<h3 id="method-two">Method Two</h3>
<p>Here, I use the term 'mining' loosely as you don't <em>technically</em> mine Orichalcum Ore. Instead, once your Mining level reaches level seven (I <em>think</em> it's seven; please correct me if I'm wrong), you can go to the Town Hall, open up the Reward Box and for reaching that Mining level, you'll be able to obtain five Orichalcum Ore.</p>
<p>So that's nice, but it's not exactly sustainable for everything you need Orichalcum Ore for. So then we move onto...</p>
<h3 id="method-three">Method Three</h3>
<p>The third and final method that I've found (so far) is getting the Sprites<strong><em></em></strong>to take you to Stonebreaker Valley. This will unlock automatically one morning once you've managed to get your mining level up high enough.</p>

<p>This place is a miner's dream with all the different types of ores you'd ever want, including Orichalcum. When you first visit this magical place, there will be a few Orichalcum rocks for you to collect ore from but be mindful that it takes them a while to come back. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-32.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1170" height="658" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/image-32.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/image-32.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/03/image-32.png 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>So it's important to keep checking in with this place and breaking a few rocks whilst you're there in order to clear some space.</p>
