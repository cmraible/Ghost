<hr>
<p>50 years ago Lamborghini shocked the world when it pulled the sheets off the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lamborghini-countach-basement/">Countach</a> at the 1971 Geneva Auto Show. Its angular, geometric design was like a shock to the system, setting the tone for the Italian automaker’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-lamborghini-countach/">design choices</a> for decades to come. Not only did <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rod-stewarts-countach/">adult enthusiasts</a> fantasize about the supercar, many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/actually-the-kids-like-classic-cars/">kids</a> back in the day had a poster of it on their wall. It looks like the Italians are looking to leverage the name’s cachet by resurrecting the nameplate in dramatic fashion.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out the Lamborghini Countach a guy built in his basement <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lamborghini-countach-basement/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Lamborghini made this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/lamborghini-going-all-electric/">shocking announcement</a> on Twitter on August 9. No date for the reveal has been released. Understandably, people are excited, because how often does such an iconic supercar come back from the pages of history and blast into the 21st Century?</p>

<p>I hate to be a wet blanket, but I’ve got a bad feeling about this one. First off, thanks to all the lovely safety regulations not only here in the US but especially in the EU, there’s no way in hell this new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lamborghini-huracan-variants/">Lamborghini</a> Countach will be anything even remotely like the original. It’s just simply impossible, so get that through your head first.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of electrification. One of the cheap tricks we’re seeing automakers increasingly use to sell everyone on electrified models is to slap a legacy name on them. Ford did it with the Mustang Mach-E and that seems to be working, at least for now, so expect more. Yes, what I’m saying is there’s a good chance the new Countach will at least be a hybrid if not a full-electric car.</p>

<p>After all, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/lamborghini-going-all-electric/">Lamborghini has unveiled its bold plan to go all-electric</a> in just 9 years. What better way to get everyone excited about the transition than to slap the Countach name on an EV?</p>
<p>Oh, but it might not even be a car. After all, Ford slapped the Mustang name on a four-door crossover. Why wouldn’t Lamborghini try the same kind of thing here? I wish that were just a wild conjecture, but at this point it’s entirely possible.</p>

<p>Hopefully the new Countach packs a fire-breathing V12 like the Aventador. I really hope <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1988-lamborghini-countach/">Lamborghini</a> does right here, but for now all we can do is hope and wait.</p>
