Don’t get me wrong, I adore Fran, she’s my favourite character in the game, but she really doesn’t add anything to the overall plot and feels like an afterthought. And now, I have to bring up the fact she’s in a wheelchair; whenever Fran is involved in an action scene, the action has to slow down considerably to accommodate her, which it really shouldn’t because her chair has a built-in hydraulic fist and a freeze ray; she’s the most action-ready character in the game but you guys gotta put the baby gloves on for her, why? There is a scene where she jumps into a shark tank and fist fights sharks but instead of showing that, the camera is glued to Octavio shoutcasting the whole thing! It just feels kind of disrespectful to those with similar afflictions. She feels like she would’ve fit better as a Vault Hunter in a mainline "
