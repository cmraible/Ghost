While we’ve seen plenty of these rides, particularly of the Corvette variety, this might be the first 1969 Camaro facelift applied to a 2010."

Imagine rolling up to a meet in this thing, you would get plenty of stares and probably more than a few questions after parking."

That’s cool if you really like the looks, just realize it’s not the hottest Camaro around and some people are going to mock the weird mashed-up looks. If you’re ok with that, then by all means buy this Chevy."

Making so many analogies between this Camaro and Bumblebee from those awful Michael Bay Transformers movies just shouldn’t be allowed by law if not by societal rules. It goes on and on about Decepticons being Mustangs and Challengers, Cybertron, interstellar voyages, and stuff that has nothing to do with this interesting build."
