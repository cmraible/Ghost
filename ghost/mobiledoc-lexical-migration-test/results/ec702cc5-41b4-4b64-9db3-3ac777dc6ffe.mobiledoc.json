Like any proper muscle car, restomodded or not, this Chevy uses a Borg Warner 6-speed manual transmission. Just mashing the accelerator and letting the computer have the fun of shifting really saps the fun out of these cars. Completing the setup is a hydraulic clutch and an 8.5 10-bolt rear. With great power comes great need to keep that power in check. Fortunately, Cal Trac bars combined with power rack-and-pinion steering, tubular control arms, QA1 coil over shocks, and power four-wheel disc brakes."
