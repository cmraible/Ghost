<p>Good things are happening! In Los Angeles, grassroots organizers made history by banning projects that have long harmed the health of millions of residents. Also, from Puerto Rico to southern New Mexico, environmental activists are making strides to change the legal battlefield against the fossil fuel industry. Meanwhile in Maine, consumers are taking energy justice into their own hands by putting a bold new measure on the 2023 ballot.</p>
<p>Read about all these historic victories in this week’s edition of You Love To See It below, a weekly feature reviewing good news and progress for <em>Lever</em> supporting subscribers.</p>

<h3 id="la-bans-oil-and-gas-drilling">LA Bans Oil And Gas Drilling</h3>
<p>In a historic win for Los Angelenos on the front lines of <a href="https://www.kcet.org/news-community/what-is-a-sacrifice-zone-the-environmental-racism-of-oil-drilling-in-l-a">environmental racism</a>, the LA City Council voted 12-0 last Friday to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-02/in-historic-move-l-a-bans-new-oil-wells-phases-out-existing-ones">ban new oil wells</a> immediately and phase out existing ones within 20 years.</p>
<p>Los Angeles sits on the single largest urban oil field in the country, with <a href="http://www.stand.la/history-of-oil-in-los-angeles.html">nearly 4 million</a> of its residents living within a quarter mile of an active or idle oil or gas well. Drilling infrastructure is <a href="https://grist.org/project/accountability/wilmington-california-oil-gas-setbacks/">predominantly located</a> in low-income communities and Black and Latinx neighborhoods. For years, grassroots groups have <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/los-angeles-oil-drilling-nalleli-cobo/">organized</a> for health protections in response to disproportionate exposure to drilling-released carcinogens and pollutants linked to respiratory disease, cancer, and other health conditions.</p>
<p>“The future of LA will be free from fossil fuel extraction,” Stand Together Against Neighborhood Drilling — LA, a coalition of community groups that spearheaded the law, said in a <a href="http://www.stand.la/campaign-updates.html">statement</a>. “Black, Latinx, and other communities of color currently living near polluting oil wells and derricks in South LA and Wilmington will eventually breathe easier.”</p>
<h3 id="a-new-model-for-prosecuting-polluters">A New Model For Prosecuting Polluters</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>The WildEarth Guardians (WEG), an environmental advocacy group, just reached an <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/oil-and-gas-operator-pays-millions-for-clean-air-act-violations">agreement</a> with an oil and gas corporation that will force the firm to pay millions and dramatically cut oilfield pollution in southern New Mexico.</p>
<p>While multinational oil and gas operator Oxy promotes itself as an industry leader in <a href="https://www.oxy.com/operations/performance-production/">responsible</a> fossil fuel production and <a href="https://www.oxy.com/operations/carbon-innovation/project-ventures/">carbon reduction</a>, WEG went after the corporation for regularly exceeding permissible levels of air pollutant releases. “There are a lot of companies and a lot of facilities that regularly report excess emissions,” Jeremy Nichols, WEG climate program director, <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/oil-and-gas-operator-pays-millions-for-clean-air-act-violations">told</a><em>Capital & Main</em>. “But this one, this Oxy facility, really rose to the top and really seemed to be a poster child for how the industry chronically violates and [passes] it off as just the cost of doing business.”</p>
<p>Using Oxy’s own industry reports that proved wrongdoing, WildEarth Guardians avoided an extended and costly public prosecution by suing under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7604">Citizen Suit</a> provision of the federal <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act">Clean Air Act</a>.</p>
<p>Through this provision, WEG rapidly accelerated the timeline for finding resolutions to pollution violations and created a legal blueprint for private groups seeking to hold fossil fuel companies accountable.</p>
<h3 id="puerto-rico-files-historic-climate-lawsuit">Puerto Rico Files Historic Climate Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Sixteen Puerto Rican municipalities are <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/11/29/puerto-rican-towns-file-rico-suit-accusing-big-oil-colluding-climate-denial">suing</a> Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and other Big Oil corporations for damages from the 2017 hurricane season exacerbated by planet-heating fossil fuel emissions.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses fossil fuel giants of colluding to profit by misleading the public and denying the catastrophic effects of fossil fuel emissions. Specifically, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/puerto-rican-towns-sue-big-oil-under-rico-alleging-collusion-climate-denial-2022-11-29/">towns argue</a> that the companies coordinated a multibillion-dollar "fraudulent marketing scheme" to convince consumers that fossil fuel products have no climate effects, and that their campaigns ran contrary to corporation-led studies showing their products accelerate climate change, resulting in more deadly storms.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico’s <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2022/12/02/puerto-rico-climate-liability-lawsuit-racketeering-fraud-shell-bp-chevron-exxon/">groundbreaking</a> climate lawsuit is the first of its kind to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act — a federal statute designed to combat organized crime and corrupt conduct — against the fossil fuel industry. In the past, RICO efforts have been effectively used to hold the tobacco industry accountable for lying about the adverse health effects of tobacco products.</p>
<h3 id="maine-gets-ready-to-challenge-investor-owned-utilities">Maine Gets Ready To Challenge Investor-Owned Utilities</h3>
<p>Our Power, a coalition of Maine ratepayers, has successfully organized a referendum to replace Maine’s <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2021/12/15/business/cmp-versant-power-jd-power-ranking/">unpopular</a> investor-owned electric utilities, Central Maine Power Company (CMP) and Versant Power, with a nonprofit, <a href="https://ourpowermaine.org/the-case-for-consumer-owned/">consumer-owned</a> utility that pledges to deliver cleaner energy with lower rates.</p>
<p>After gathering more than 80,000 signatures as of last month, far exceeding the total needed to trigger a referendum, their consumer-owned utility question has <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2022/11/30/politics/consumer-owned-utility-qualifies-2023-ballot/">qualified</a> for Maine’s November 2023 ballot.</p>
<p>“We have news for you, CMP and Versant, and for your greedy corporate and foreign-government owners,” <a href="https://mainebeacon.com/our-power-delivers-signatures-to-trigger-2023-referendum-on-consumer-owned-utility/">said</a> Andrew Blunt, executive director of Our Power, at a press conference. “Today, over 80,000 Maine voters are ready to revoke your monopoly privilege.”</p>
<p>In 2021, the legislature passed a bill to put the same question to the voters in November of that year. However, that measure was <a href="https://mainebeacon.com/mills-vetoes-bill-that-would-allow-voters-to-consider-creating-consumer-owned-utility/">vetoed</a> by Gov. Janet Mills (D), prompting Our Power to launch the now successful referendum effort.</p>
<p>The idea for a consumer takeover was originally spurred by the poor performances of investor-owned companies that prioritize delivering profit to shareholders. The proposed consumer-owned utility, Pine Tree Power, would instead invest rate payments into improving services.</p>

<h3 id="finally">Finally:</h3>
<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read an excerpt from Aracelis Girmay’s poem, “<a href="https://poets.org/poem/you-are-who-i-love">You Are Who I Love</a>”:</p>
<p>You, selling roses out of a silver grocery cart</p>
<p>You, in the park, feeding the pigeons</p>
<p>You cheering for the bees</p>
<p>You with cats in your voice in the morning, feeding cats</p>
<p>You protecting the river<br></p>
