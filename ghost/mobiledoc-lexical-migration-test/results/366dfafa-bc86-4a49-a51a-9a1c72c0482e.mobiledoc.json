This is a stealth mission, so do not try to attack or shoot fireballs at the penguins. Also try to stay out of their line of sight, which you can see by the little shining area coming from them. If you get caught, you&#8217;ll be sent to the dungeon where you&#8217;ll need to transform into the snake in order to get out and you&#8217;ll be where you started.</p>\n<p>For the first penguin, simply jump up to the ledge above and continue onwards (these penguins aren&#8217;t particularly bright). In the next room, keep heading down until you&#8217;re on this level and transform into the pig to use your sense of smell in order to find the switch&#8230;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3613\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Monster Boy Castle of Lupia\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?w=2880&amp;ssl=1 2880w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?resize=2000%2C1124&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?resize=1300%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.15.16-pm.png?w=2700&amp;ssl=1 2700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Flick the switch and you can head down the ladder that just appeared (there is a Power Gem behind the guard just above).</p>\n<p>On the bottom level, transform into the snake and squeeze through the little hole on the right&#8230;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Monster Boy Castle Prison\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?w=2880&amp;ssl=1 2880w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?resize=2000%2C1124&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?resize=1300%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-12.20.05-pm.png?w=2700&amp;ssl=1 2700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>In the next room, transform into the lion and ground-pound through the blocks just up ahead.
