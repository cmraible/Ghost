It had been left there for at least three days, police told the family, and the car was covered with a tarp. However, high winds at the time undid the plan to keep it out of sight, so some watchful maintenance and security workers spotted it, then called police because they saw the news story. Other than being dirty, the T-Bird is apparently just fine.  ",
