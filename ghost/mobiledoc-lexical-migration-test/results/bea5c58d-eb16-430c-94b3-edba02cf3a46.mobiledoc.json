            " the seventh extension of the federal student loan repayment pause that began in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. While the extension was welcome, it underscored Biden’s refusal to take more drastic permanent action to reduce the whopping $1.7 trillion Americans owe on student loans. While the president has taken some action on the matter since then, including his announcement in August to do means-tested cancellation of some student debt, there is much more that could be done to solve the crisis. Here, we dig into the nuts and bolts of the subject, Biden’s track record of empty promises, and right-wing pundits and neoliberals’ flawed logic that student loan forgiveness is welfare for the middle and upper classes."

            " Benjamin Franklin famously said, “Nothing is certain except death and taxes.” The founding father would have been wise to add a caveat: For the ultrawealthy, taxes are far from a certainty. Demands to “tax the rich” gained steam during the pandemic, and the calls were renewed this spring as millions of Americans scrambled to file their taxes by the April deadline. That’s why we wrote this Cheat Sheet, which tackles the unfairness of our tax system: who is and isn’t paying up, how legal loopholes create tax giveaways, and what can be done to hold accountable those who can and should be paying the most."

In response to that false and destructive narrative, we wrote this Cheat Sheet on the real factors behind the largest increase in consumer goods prices since 1982. In it, we explore what’s really driven inflation, from corporate profiteering to fossil fuel fleecing, and we give our take on what lawmakers can do to tackle the issue and protect Americans’ pocketbooks."

            "There is a major, under-covered player in the U.S. health care system that wields tremendous power in determining who gets access to life-saving medication. A group of businesses called Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, set prescription drug benefits nationwide — and instead of passing savings they negotiate onto patients, these firms pocket the proceeds and reap gargantuan profits. A tiny handful of PBMs, most of which are owned by insurers, control nearly the entire market — yet most people don’t know they exist, and they have long skirted federal oversight. In this Cheat Sheet, we pull back the curtain on PBMs, explain why they’re so dangerous, and explore what can be done to stop them."
