It was called a natural fit since Leake operated primarily in Oklahoma and Texas, plus it was already using IronPlanet bidding software for online auctions, which is part of the Ritchie Bros. organization. Thanks to the 3.9 million registered users through Ritchie Bros., Leake boasted what was potentially the largest bases of shoppers in the collector car industry, so the union was seemingly unstoppable. Nobody could have known back then the challenges everyone has faced in 2020. "
