After many decades of roads getting safer, statistics show they’re starting to get more dangerous again so we’re trying to find innovative approaches to tackle that challenge.”"

It sounds like there have been other efforts to get British Columbia to adopt this practice but they’ve fallen flat. This one might as well, but this idea sounds like it’s spreading from Europe to North America. In other words, it’s only a matter of time before California, New York, and other parts of the US start entertaining progressive road fines as well."

There are many ways a plan like this could backfire, but ultimately it seems to be rooted in class division, not a genuine desire to lower road fatalities. After all, cops in some municipalities could purposely profile people in expensive cars, nailing them for even the slightest infractions with the hope they’d score big money in fines. There are better ways to attack the problem of increasing road fatalities."
