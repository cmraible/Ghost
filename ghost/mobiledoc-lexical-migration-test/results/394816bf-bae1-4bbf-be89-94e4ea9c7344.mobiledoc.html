<p>According to a local report, the limo service driver brought the classic Bentley back to the company garage at 9:30 pm. Unbeknownst to employees, a man walked into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-steal-chevy-camaro/">open garage door</a> behind the car, then hid inside another car until everyone left the building.</p>

<p>It took the man until 1 am to get the Bentley started and out of the garage. The limo service owner believes the person wasn’t familiar with how to drive such a vehicle, which isn’t like most modern cars. Also, the Bentley has been modified with an American transmission and antilock brakes. It also has a new engine instead of the original powerplant.</p>
<p>Thanks to surveillance video footage police in Kansas City know how the heist went down. The man was dropped off at the garage by a white Ford Fusion Hybrid, which was possibly stolen as well. Now the limousine service, which has struggled during the pandemic is hurting even more since the Bentley was a key part of the business.</p>
