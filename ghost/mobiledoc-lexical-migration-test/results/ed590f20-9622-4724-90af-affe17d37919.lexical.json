Maybe it’s because I’m fresh off the feeling of bitterness towards the Mayor of Myrtle Beach for throwing shade at Mustang Week, but when I hear more police around cars, I think they’re taking drivers to jail, but that’s not exactly the case here. After a SUV driver killed parade goers and a shooter opened fire into a crowd recently, the local Sheriff’s offices are not taking any chances.",
