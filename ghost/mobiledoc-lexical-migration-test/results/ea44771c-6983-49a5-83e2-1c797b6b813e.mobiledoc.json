Actually a badge-engineered Opel Omega B, they only ran from 1997 to 2001 before getting the ax. Someone decided this 2001 model would be the perfect sleeper car, and we do love sleepers, sending it to Lingenfelter for that magical treatment they do."

That LS7 is the same 7.0-liter V8 engine used in the C6 Corvette Z06, mind you. From the exterior most people wouldn’t suspect this is anything other than a regular Catera, if they even recognize what it is. In true sleeper fashion, there are only a few little enhancements visible."
