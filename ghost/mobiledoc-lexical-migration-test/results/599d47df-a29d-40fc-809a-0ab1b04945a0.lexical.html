<p><a href="https://auction.tommackclassics.com/vehicles/904/1966-chevrolet-deluxe-panel-truck">Chevrolet has</a> been in the business of making small pickup trucks since the early days of automobiles. So whether it's a farm truck, daily driver, or tradesmen's commuter, you can usually be sure that your Chevy will last for a long time. However, some trucks seem to have a nearly indefinite lifespan as they have been around so long and have been taken outstanding care of. That is undoubtedly the case for this particular vehicle, as the exterior still presents a well-maintained vehicle after decades of use. This is an excellent truck for any classic car enthusiast with a unique taste for workhorses, but what makes it a fantastic car?</p>

<p>First of all, the engine was a wild option for its era as it uses eight cylinders and some pretty impressive displacement to produce good power. Under the hood of this <a href="https://auction.tommackclassics.com/vehicles/904/1966-chevrolet-deluxe-panel-truck">1965 Chevrolet Deluxe Panel Truck</a> is a 283 cubic inchV8engine which would have been perfect for carrying heavy loads at the time. Horsepower estimates for this vehicle should range from around 200 to about 300 horsepower with even more torque! This truck certainly won't feel sluggish when you open up the throttle, which sets it apart from other trucks like it. Of course, it matters less how much horsepower something has versus how it uses that power.</p>

<p>Indeed <a href="https://auction.tommackclassics.com/vehicles/904/1966-chevrolet-deluxe-panel-truck">this vehicle</a> is excellent at putting its power to the ground as the engine is connected to a three-speed manual transmission. Anyone who has ever driven a three on the tree will tell you that this is the perfect option for this type of truck as it makes driving a skillful process. Finally, the previous owner added the center console and bucket seats, who honestly completed the interior design quite well. It isn't a day that you see such a tastefully done internal modification that positively makes such a significant difference in the design. So it is clear to see that this truck is a tremendous opportunity for an automotive enthusiast like yourself to get your hands on one of the most desirable vehicles on the vintage truck market today.</p>
