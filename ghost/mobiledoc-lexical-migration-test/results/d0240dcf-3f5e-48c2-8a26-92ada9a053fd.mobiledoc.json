The amazing variety of cars had buyers acting like kids in a candy store with a total of 55 cars, trucks and SUVs being sold off (only four vehicles didn't sell) for a total of almost $7.1 million â€“ and that doesn't even include the equally incredible automobilia that was up for grabs. The top nine highest-priced cars alone all exceeded their pre-auction estimates selling for a collective $1.7 million, and they were a shining example of how vastly diverse Vannoy's collection was ranging from "

Hammering for more than the Superbird, the coolest vehicle, without a doubt, auctioned off was a 1941 Kenworth fire truck that sold for $209,000. The Art Deco design is incredible, but the more impressive part of this fire truck is that only five of these were ever built. A gorgeous LS3-powered 1967 Corvette restomod was the only other vehicle to break the $200,000 mark with a sale price of $200,750."
