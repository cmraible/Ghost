Hosted in the atrium of the Mercedes-Benz World facility in Brooklands, UK, is what has to be one of the most extensively restored 280 SL examples anywhere in the world. Two years of hard work produced this four-wheeled work of art that is now estimated to be worth around $375,000."

          "UK-based Hemmels received the car in 2017 after it was bought at auction in America. They then began the process of stripping the Mercedes back to bare metal to assess the condition of the bodywork. Extensive work was then carried out to replace worn, degraded, and rusted chassis and bodywork before being repainted. The engine received just as much attention, being rebuilt along with the gearbox. Hemmels then replaced the brakes and suspension to complete this ‘like-new’ convertible."

          "Hemmels does much more than simply restoring neglected classics, as customers can choose their exacting specification, much like you would a new car. A suitable vehicle is sourced before being dismantled and assessed -  ready for replacement parts and refitting. They call the process ‘Neugeboren’, or ‘newborn’ in English, as it allows their customers to own a classic that feels like it is fresh out of a showroom from a bygone era."
