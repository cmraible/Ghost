<h2 id="audio-s-advantage">Audio's Advantage</h2>
<p>Danish site <em>Zetland</em> has been a favourite of mine, since I saw their <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2017/04/zetland-journalism-profitable-community-service/">editor-in-chief speak at a conference</a> a few years ago. (Remember those days, so very long ago, when we used to <em>go</em> to conferences? Crazy times.) </p>
<p>They've talked before about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2018/05/zetlands-audio-stories-are-outperforming-its-written-ones/">their success with audio versions</a> of their journalism, but <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/-campfire-like-audio-articles-the-key-to-zetland-s-membership-growth/s2/a761252/">this is remarkable reinforcement</a> of that:</p>
<blockquote>This strategy has proved effective during the coronavirus pandemic, attracting at one point around 2,000 members in a three-week period.</blockquote>
<p>Their audio articles have a better retention rate than their traditional web ones. If you want to be read, be listened to…</p>
<h3 id="journalists-or-writers">Journalists or writers?</h3>
<p>And that reminds me of a question that has long been in my head: are we <em>journalists</em> or <em>writers</em>? I'd argue that the difference is important — and, in fact, I did so when one of my students <a href="http://www.interhacktives.com/2020/09/13/adam-tinworth-multimedia-communication-storytelling/">interviewed me earlier in the year</a>:</p>
<blockquote>At my heart I’m not really a videographer or a photographer, I am a journalist. But I am a journalist as opposed to a writer. And I think that’s quite an important distinction; a lot of journalists are hard writers, are word people, whereas I like telling stories, and there are multiple ways we can tell a story. Even when I was in print I was always very interested in the visual side of my journalism as well as the written side, and [the] magazines I worked for and sections I edited tended to be very visual . When I was commissioning magazine features I used to have the art editor or the art director of the section with us. […] We tended to develop illustration ideas in parallel with the story, and not in sequence with the story.</blockquote>
<p>We tend to concentrate too much on the output form, and not enough on the input. Journalism is a process, a craft, that can be give rise to multiple different forms of output from the same process. Let me explain. </p>
<h3 id="fit-the-form-to-the-story-not-the-other-way-around">Fit the form to the story, not the other way around</h3>
<p>The transition to digital means that, whatever branch of journalism we hail from, all the major media forms are available to us: audio, video, text, images, and so on.</p>
<ul>
    <li>How do we best get the information our readers want or need to them? </li>
    <li>What form of media suits both the story <em>and</em> the potential audience?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are questions we don't ask ourselves nearly enough. Getting the answer right can make a significant difference. </p>
<h3 id="bbc-s-odd-audio-move">BBC's odd audio move</h3>
<p>All of which makes the BBC's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/13/radio-reporters-to-be-axed-by-bbc-and-told-to-reapply-for-new-roles">recent move</a> rather puzzling: </p>
<blockquote>But now the BBC plans to axe all its national radio reporters and ask them to reapply for a smaller number of jobs as television, radio and digital reporters, rather than as dedicated audio journalists. Many fear it is not just the end of their careers but the premature end of an era for the BBC.</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>“In practice,” she added, “people’s time won’t be spread equally across platforms. There are likely to be some who do the majority of their reporting for radio, for example.” The BBC remains confident “listeners will still hear lots of carefully crafted radio reports and packages”, she said.</blockquote>
<p>This feels like a very 2009 move. We were doing this sort of thing with the editorial teams at RBI back then; redefining them by beat, rather than by output type. But we also quickly realised that you needed specialists in particular styles of output, too, because you can't realistically expect every journalist to be skilled in every media form. This is what Paul Bradshaw articulated as the <a href="https://www.asbpe.org/blog/2011/12/12/adam-tinworth-on-the-rise-of-new-and-social-media/">"flying zombie laser shark" problem</a>. </p>
<p>You end up having to retreat slightly from the ideal position, to allow people to concentrate on their specialisms, even if they do other things as well. </p>
<p>My gut feeling is that the BBC will probably end up not terribly far from where it started, with many people mainly working on radio and podcasts, but with a wider remit, too. Perhaps this is an exercise to remove from the payroll those who can't look <em>beyond</em> audio, whom can always be deployed as freelancers when needed.</p>
<p>All in all, it feels like a lot of bad feeling for very little strategic gain. </p>
<h3 id="an-in-ear-members-club">An in-ear members' club</h3>
<p>Let's finish a more positive example: I've often come close to unsubscribing to the daily <em>Stratechery</em> email, because the volume is just so high. But when Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-daily-update-podcast/">added podcasts for members</a> — not new content, just the emails read out — all of a sudden I <em>could</em> keep up. If I hadn't managed to read the email during the working day, I could catch up while cooking or doing the washing up.</p>
<p>Through adding the same material in a different format, Thompson stopped me churning away.</p>
<p>I'd listen to that, if I were you.</p>
<p><em>(Sorry, I can never resist ending with a terrible pun…)</em></p>
