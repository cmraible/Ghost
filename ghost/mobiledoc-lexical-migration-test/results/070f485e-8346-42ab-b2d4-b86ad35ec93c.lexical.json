The connecting rods and block were modified to accommodate that longer stroke, there’s a forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods, and forged aluminum pistons. Plus, there are 4 main caps and a forged rotating assembly to add strength as well as increase durability. We’re curious to see just how well this thing takes to aftermarket modifications, which we’ll no doubt get an answer to soon enough.",
