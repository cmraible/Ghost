<p>A lot of people think they know <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1949-chevy-rat-rod-truck/">rat rods</a> but they really don’t. In some respects it’s one of the least-understood genres of automotive enthusiasm, easily dismissed by critics as “junk” or “weird-looking.” They kind of miss the point, but in a strange way that might be part of the point. Anyway, to really understand <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-find-1930/">rat rods</a> you have to go back to where it all <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1935-dodge-pickup-street-rod/">began as a pushback</a> against the increasingly ridiculous <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1966-nove-prostreet/">Pro Street movement</a> in the late 80s.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s pretty controversial when the rat rod movement started exactly (just like it’s controversial defining what elements make something a rat rod). Some claim it was Gary Bakersville and his ’32 Ford “Rusto Rod” which was featured on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">Hot Rod</a> magazine cover back in 1982 which inspired the movement.</p>
<p>Others claim Jim “Jake” Jacobs was the one who started the rat rod movement back in 1987. He welded together a ’32 Ford frame, ’28 Ford two-door sedan body, etc. to make a hot rod tub unlike any other before. Chopping the roof and the windshield until it was just above the dash, he put a small-block Chevy V8 in the front. Then he bolted an old bench seat into the cab and called it good. The thing was rough all around, being unpainted, making a strong statement when Jacobs took it to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/james-hetfield-shows-off-his-car-collection/">Goodguys West Coast Nationals</a>. There’s a funny story about how he painted the car by hand during the show, others jumping in to help, but we can dive into that in another article.</p>

<p>The video attached to this article is a documentary beautifully done and it’s all about Robert Williams, an artist others claim started the rat rod movement. Williams had been on the hot rod scene since he was a teenager and worked for Ed Roth back in the day.</p>
<p>Are you confused yet? Maybe you already have an opinion of who started the rat rod movement. That probably depends in part on how you personally define a rat rod. There’s a lot of disagreement out there, so we’ll just leave it at that. But if you want to sound off in the comments, feel free to do so.</p>
