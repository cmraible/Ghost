          "Powering this vehicle is a twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter DOHC V8 engine And three electric motors, all adding up to a power output of around 1500 horsepower. From there, that force is transferred through a direct drive transmission and further controlled with the pushrod suspension featuring active dampeners.
