<hr>
<p>Many people would absolutely kill to own a beautiful <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjE5NzAiLCJjaGV2ZWxsZSIsInNzIl19">1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS convertible</a>. While some would get turned off by the fact this is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/younger-gearheads-restomod/">restomod</a> with an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/procharged-chevelle/">LS swap</a> and modern Camaro interior, there are still quite a few enthusiasts who like that sort of thing. What really kills this build for us is the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/twin-turbo-1970-chevelle-ss/">huge 22-inch wheels</a> and low-profile tires, which technically make this a donk, or so we’re told.</p>

<p>Look, some people <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/austin-residents-attack-car-meets/">really like donks</a> and that’s great for them. But we like performance and throwing huge wheels with low-profile tires on a muscle car like this isn’t a good move. Sure, it might look flashy and all, but the same could be said for one of those really tall aluminum rear wings a bunch of people bolted onto their mom’s old Nissan Altima after watching the first <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fast-furious-car-death-toll/"><em>Fast and Furious</em></a> movie.</p>

<p>At lest this Chevelle sounds mean, so there’s that. But we don’t expect to see it tearing down a dragstrip anytime. Plus, in the video you can hear the owner saying it’s pushing 525-horsepower, so there are no crazy internal mods you can’t see. Oh well.</p>
<p>Yes, there are car sites out there which will lecture you about judging donks because you don’t “get the culture.” If this were a lowrider we’d agree, but donks are like stanced or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/crazy-bosozoku-toyota-cresta/">bosozoku</a> cars: they suck. There’s no culture to get with these atrocities. Sure, that might sound harsh to some people but it’s true.</p>

<p>Before you watch the video, be warned the guy can’t hold the camera steady for reasons we don’t understand. Yes, it’s really annoying when people who are filming things act like a kangaroo on its fifth espresso of the day, but this sort of thing is all too common on the internet. Maybe invest in a rig if you want to have better content for your YouTube channel? Anyway, check out the video if you want to see this car in greater detail.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dBaQuZvv83M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
