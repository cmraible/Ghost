<p>“Jones should know that, despite the Court’s decision today, what he does in life matters. So, too, do the efforts of the almost 1,500 other juvenile offenders like Jones who are serving [life-without-parole] sentences.”</p>
<p>— Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent to the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-1259_8njq.pdf">April 22 decision</a> upholding the conviction of Brett Jones, sentenced to life without parole as a juvenile.</p>

<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>Democratic Arizona lawmaker Kyrsten Sinema has long enjoyed labor support. Her 2012 congressional campaign was buoyed by a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/aidachavez/status/1384968419406237696">major union endorsements</a>. And her 2018 Senate run benefited from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/outside-spending?cycle=2018&id=AZS2&spec=N">ample union spending</a>, including more than a million dollars in total from two labor groups in particular, UNITE HERE Arizona and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).</p>
<p>So labor groups might not have been pleased when, after a major Arizona business group recently asked her about the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, she refused to signal her support of the sweeping labor reform bill, leaving her as one of only three Senate Democrats who haven’t done so.</p>
<p>Instead, she <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1384954714207526914">told the business leaders</a>: “The way I make decisions on behalf of Arizona and for our constituents is by listening to the business leaders who will be impacted by these decisions.” She didn’t mention listening to workers or unions at all.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>In 2019, the Business Roundtable pledged that its members would help build “an economy that serves all Americans,” not just corporate shareholders. Instead, the lobbying group for powerful corporate CEOs has been fighting the idea of a $15 minimum wage, and pushing lawmakers to give companies immunity from COVID-related lawsuits if their workers get sick.</p>
<p>Now, the Business Roundtable <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ceos-fight-for-their-tax-cuts-despite/">is also leading the fight</a> against Joe Biden’s plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent in order to fund national infrastructure investments. The group is claiming a tax hike on businesses “will hurt American workers.”</p>
<p>As the Business Roundtable works to vilify Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike, new IRS records reveal that the organization isn’t just working to influence Beltway policymakers and pundits through lobbying — it’s also funding the media shaping the debate. The organization’s latest tax return shows it paid nearly $500,000 to <em>Politico</em> in 2019, which it listed as an independent contractor.</p>
<p>This isn’t the same as a company buying ads in a newspaper. This is a lobby group sponsoring the media outlet that shapes coverage of the legislative issues the lobby group cares about.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• BIDEN SCORES WELL IN AVOIDING CORPORATE INFLUENCE:</strong> The Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes presidential appointees to ensure they serve public interests, has given Pres. Joe Biden a B- grade for his performance so far at avoiding corporate influence in his departments. In its <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Corporate-Capture-Report-Card.pdf">new report</a>, the organization gave Biden high marks for the independent and uncompromised regulators he’s placed in charge of overseeing the financial industry, fossil fuels, and big tech, but criticized the administration’s ties to defense contractors and the influence industry. “Although the bar is low, Biden has proven to be the least captured and most public-oriented president of any of our lifetimes,” noted the report. “That said, Biden’s administration thus far is certainly not spotless.”</p>
<p><strong>• BARRETT PRESSURED TO RECUSE HERSELF FROM KOCH DARK MONEY CASE: </strong>Democratic lawmakers are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-blumenthal-johnson-call-on-justice-barrett-to-recuse-herself-from-koch-dark-money-case">calling on</a> Justice Amy Coney Barrett to recuse herself from the upcoming Supreme Court case<em> Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Rodriquez</em>, which will decide whether the billionaire Koch family’s conservative advocacy group is protected under the First Amendment from revealing information about the donors behind its dark-money spending. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is the nonprofit wing of the Koch’s Americans for Prosperity organization, which last year said it was planning to spend “in the seven figures” to install Barrett on the Supreme Court. The case is scheduled to be argued next week, with a decision expected in June.</p>
<p><strong>• CUOMO IMPEACHMENT PROBE GAINING STEAM: </strong>The law firm running the New York Assembly’s impeachment probe of Gov. Andrew Cuomo has <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Impeachment-investigators-have-contacted-70-16118502.php">already reached out to</a> 70 potential witnesses and requested files from four state agencies since it began its investigation last month. The legislative probe, and separate investigations underway by the state attorney general’s office and the local U.S. attorney’s office, are together examining a growing list of potential wrongdoings by the governor, including covering up the total COVID-19 deaths at state nursing homes, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">shielding nursing home execs</a> from legal liability, and allegedly sexually harassing numerous women. At a press conference this week, Cuomo refused to say whether he would resign if investigators conclude the sexual harassment claims are valid.</p>
<p><strong>• BLACKSTONE ENJOYS BANNER FIRST QUARTER </strong>Blackstone Group, the world’s largest private equity firm, just posted its best quarter ever, with <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/blackstone-posts-highest-profit-growth-equity-spacs">$1.75 billion in profits </a>over the first three months of the year. Much of the earnings came from two of its acquisitions, including the dating app Bumble, going public. Blackstone is making big bets on a post-COVID-19 economic recovery, spending billions in the first quarter to acquire, among other ventures, a private jet firm and a British vacation company.</p>
