The engaging and raw experience of driving a manual transmission vehicle is unlike anything an automatic could replicate. So it makes sense that many enthusiasts choose this form of driving over manual or even sequential gearboxes. Oddly enough, this also applies to racing which is virtually unheard of because of automatic transmission innovations of the last couple of decades or so.",

Despite all odds, the driver was able to set a new record for H-pattern racing.
