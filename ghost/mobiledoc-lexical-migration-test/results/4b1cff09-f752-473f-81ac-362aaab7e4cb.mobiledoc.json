Obama, because his social media use was so carefully planned, so carefully managed that he was bale to build a great profile. Trump, on the other hand, has a reputation for the exact opposite - but one that still activates his base. "

They think it should be so simple: just tweet your press releases‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour ‚Äúsocial media statements,‚Äù as their leader recently said‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääplus your best lines from speeches that get the loudest, hottest applause and rack up the most followers like the highest TV ratings and you will win. No. Twitter, Facebook, et al are not means to make a mass, like TV was. They are means to develop relationships and trust and to gather people around not just a person but also an idea, a cause, a common goal. That‚Äôs how Ocasio-Cortez uses them."
