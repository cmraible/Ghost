<p>Starting with the vintage style of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1993-land-rover-defender-90-is-a-performance-luxury-suv-to-be-feared/">Land Rover</a> Defender, Arkonik did a full frame-off restoration to create the go-anywhere SUV you see here. The Aintree Green Metallic paint job is the perfect color for this British off-roader, but inside is where this rig really shines with quilted leather throughout. This luxury interior is also fitted with a custom sound system and navigation system, and to keep your gear secure, there's also a locking center console and a locking storage drawer topped with diamond plate for added durability and style.</p>
<p>With only 12,000 miles since built, this Defender looks better than it did back in 1992, and it's even more capable in rugged terrain thanks to the air lockers, two-inch suspension lift, 15-inch bead-lock wheels and meaty BFGoodrich tires; an extra set of 18-inch alloy wheels is also included with the Land Rover. Pictures show this Land Rover blasting through powder snow and perched atop an overlook with a rooftop camper, and all that's missing for its next adventure is a new owner. Speaking of pictures, the gallery also shows the extensive restoration that this Land Rover underwent.</p>
<p>Powering this Defender is a 2.5-liter turbodiesel inline-four backed by a five-speed manual transmission with a two-speed transfer case. This engine should provide more than enough low-end torque to power through and/or over just about any, but if that isn't good enough, there's also a 12,000-pound winch ready to come to the rescue.</p>
