While there aren't many details about the EV systems (except that it uses in-house built lithium-ion battery packs), the company does suggest a minimum range of 250 miles. As you might expect, converting a classic car into an EV is not a cheap undertaking; excluding the price of the donor car, Lunaz Design conversions will start at £350,000 – that's close to $450,000 USD."
