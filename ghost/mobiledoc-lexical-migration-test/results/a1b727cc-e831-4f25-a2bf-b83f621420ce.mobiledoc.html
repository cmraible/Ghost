<hr>
<p>As most people know, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/steve-mcqueen-green-r-code-mustang/">Steve McQueen</a> didn’t just play a cool car guy on the big screen, the man was a diehard gearhead in real life. Another of his cars is heading to auction for Monterey Car Week this year and it’s causing some waves. After all, the 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 was delivered to the movie star on the set of <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bullitt-charger-where-is-it-now/">Bullitt</a></em>, adding to its collectability.</p>

<p>Owned by McQueen for about four years, sadly this Ferrari didn’t appear in any of the actor’s films. He was bitten by the Ferrari bug originally as he was filming <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/steve-mcqueen-inspired-triumph-bonneville-scrambler/">The Thomas Crown Affair</a></em> and drove a 275 N.A.R.T. Spyder, getting one for himself. However, disaster soon after he purchased the car rendered it useless for what McQueen felt was too long. Frustrated, he sold that car and bought this 275 GTB/4.</p>

<p>After McQueen had his fun with this classic Ferrari, it ended up in the possession of Guy Williams, the TV actor who’s well-known for his roles in <em>Zorro</em> and <em>Lost in Space</em>. Later, it was owned by Formula 1, Indy, and Le Mans racer Vern Schuppan. There’s plenty of star power loaded into this car.</p>

<p>From 2010 to 2013 this Ferrari went through a full restoration by Ferrari Classiche. The aim was to restore it to McQueen’s specifications, making it clear who out of all the owners has the most star power.</p>

<p>This Ferrari 275 GTB/4 was listed at RM Sotheby’s Monterey auction back in 2014, selling for a whopping $10,175,000. This time around, it’s anticipated to net somewhere between $5 million and $7 million when it makes its return to RM Sotheby’s Monterey event this August. That is quite the drop in value over the past nine years, but perhaps that means the new owner will be getting quite the deal. After all, a car like this guarantees admittance into some of the most prestigious concours events around the world, so some might say it’s a small price to pay for that level of access.</p>
