This highly presentable <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> is a numbers-matching example, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-six-figure-muscle-car-would-you-buy/">something which is becoming more difficult to find these days</a>. That alone <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/numbers-matching-1970/">adds considerably to its collectability</a> both now and in the future.</p>

<p>There’s a numbers-matching 440ci V8 under the hood, and it works with a numbers-matching A727 TorqueFlite automatic transmission for that authentic driving experience. Before you think that means an uncomfortable time behind the wheel, know this car has both power steering and power brakes, so it will be far more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Speaking of comfort, the black interior has bucket seats and a console. You’ll also note all the switchgear, gauges, etc. are factory-correct. While all that is impressive to look at, it’s the correct Sunfire Yellow exterior, black vinyl roof, black stripes, and those Magnum 500 wheels with redline tires which will really make everyone stare.</p>

<p>Using the architecture of the popular Road Runner, Plymouth made the GTX a more civilized, luxurious performance machine as a way to appeal to those who didn’t like the stripped-down, bare-bones approach. This is why the GTX became known as a “gentleman’s” muscle car. Don’t be fooled, because it’s still a legitimate performer, even with extra sound deadening. Today, the GTX has been recognized for what it always was, with values to match the reputation. There’s also little doubt that as time marches on, well-kept examples like this one will continue to appreciate, as well as turn plenty of heads.</p>
