<p>Ports are overflowing with shipping containers, manufacturers are scrambling to find materials, stores are running low on goods, and banking experts predict spiraling inflation as the world grapples with the so-called “Great Supply Chain Disruption” of 2021. Are the global shortages simply the effect of pandemic-related shutdowns, or is the planet’s production system in need of a massive overhaul? In this edition of Weekend Reader, we highlight several stories that delve deep into the supply chain woes spreading across the globe — and explore how part of the blame can be traced back to corporate monopolies and neoliberal outsourcing policies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/supply-chain-crisis-savannah-port.html"><strong>‘It’s Not Sustainable’: What America’s Port Crisis Looks Like Up Close</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“It has come to this in the Great Supply Chain Disruption: They are running out of places to put things at one of the largest ports in the United States. As major ports contend with a staggering pileup of cargo, what once seemed like a temporary phenomenon — a traffic jam that would eventually dissipate — is increasingly viewed as a new reality that could require a substantial refashioning of the world’s shipping infrastructure.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/15/lobbyist-hunter-ivan-adler-516069"><strong>Drain the swamp? This guy's trying to fill it.</strong></a> (Politico) <em>“He is a recruiter — one of the top in D.C. — who specializes in plucking lawmakers and staffers off the Hill or elsewhere in government and placing them into jobs on K Street, whether it be trade associations, corporations, law practices or lobbying firms. The president of the boutique shop Ivan Adler Associates, he calls himself ‘The Lobbyist Hunter.’ His eponymous firm specializes in matching government relations and public affairs professionals with gigs on “K Street... and beyond.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/counterfeit-capitalism-why-a-monopolized"><strong>Counterfeit Capitalism: Why a Monopolized Economy Leads to Inflation and Shortages</strong></a> (BIG By Matt Stoller) — <em>“There is a third explanation for inflation and shortages, and it’s not simply that the Fed has printed too much money or that Covid introduced a supply shock (though both are likely factors.) It’s a political and policy story. The consolidation of power over supply chains in the hands of Wall Street, and the thinning out of how we make and produce things over forty years in the name of efficiency, has made our economy much less resilient to shocks. These shortages are the result.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://quillette.com/2021/10/13/confronting-the-supply-chain-crisis"><strong>Confronting the Supply Chain Crisis</strong></a><strong></strong>(Quillette) — <em>“The supply chain disaster has also revealed the existence of crippling economic dependence, particularly on China, in high-income countries. Today, whole industries in the West—from medical equipment to chip and car makers to food—rely on China for finished products and key components. When China cannot (or decides not to) supply these parts, whole industries suffer debilitating supply chain shortages. The notion of a rational, self-regulating market system is unraveling and may yet presage the demise of the prevailing neoliberal era.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.readtangle.com/posts/why-i-write-about-politics-tangle/?ref=ghost"><strong>Why I Write About Politics</strong></a><strong></strong>(Tangle) — <em>“It’s not just about wanting people to shed that cynicism, it’s about helping people realize that being a cynic is the easy way out. And that perhaps the key to not being so cynical is to better understand how the sausage is made, why people believe what they believe, and then how you want to change the country you live in.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/alden-global-capital-killing-americas-newspapers/620171/"><strong>A Secretive Hedge Fund Is Gutting Newsrooms</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“‘They call Alden a vulture hedge fund, and I think that’s honestly a misnomer,’ Johnson said. ‘A vulture doesn’t hold a wounded animal’s head underwater. This is predatory.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://studyhall.xyz/ghostwriting/"><strong>Ghostwriting</strong></a> (Study Hall) — <em>“Social media and audio production are just two of the invisible structures built to prop up a select few voices that are deemed valuable in the media industry. The people who do that work are not considered to be — or compensated like — experts in their fields the way high-profile  columnists are. Beyond pay and credit discrepancies, the invisibility of this labor props up the fallacy that great works of journalism and art come from a singular, gifted individual. Because we’re invested in that myth — and maybe the secret hope that we could be one of those individuals — we build structures to support it.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/honduran-islanders-push-back-libertarian-startup/"><strong>A Libertarian ‘Startup City’ In Honduras Faces Its Biggest Hurdle: The Locals</strong></a> (Rest of World) — <em>“Since the 20th century, foreign investors have come to Honduras promising jobs and a higher standard of living. In practice, these arrangements have tended to enrich the foreigners while doing little to deliver on the promised benefits, said José Luis Palma Herrera, a Honduran researcher who has written about ZEDEs. This year, skeptical Hondurans organized weeks of anti-ZEDE protests across the country. They fear cities like Próspera will leave ordinary people no better off than they were before, while ceding to profit-driven investors the power to decide what’s in the public interest.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/magazine/questlove-summer-of-soul.html"><strong>The Passion of Questlove</strong></a> (New York Times Magazine) — <em>“Joseph Patel, a producer on the film and a longtime friend of Thompson’s, told me that Thompson approached ‘Summer of Soul’ as a kind of corrective. If the festival didn’t get to be the stuff of legend for their generation, maybe it could be for the next. ‘He’s on this mission to tell these stories as sort of a larger restoration project of Black history, and to show that Black history is American history.’ Thompson encourages us to imagine a world in which Black music history isn’t merely consumed but is venerated and treated like the cultural monument it is — like the way it already exists to him.”</em></p>
