Bikes like this one were used to win races in places like Daytona Beach back in the day, capturing the hearts and imaginations of Americans from coast to coast. With 5 miles on the restoration, this bike is ready to rip for plenty of good times."

It also has a well-earned patina which makes the Skyway blue fenders and fuel tank look that much better. While this bike might look like something you’d see in a museum, it can be ridden, thanks the recently rebuilt engine, which also has just 5 miles on it since completion."
