<hr>
<p>We’re constantly amazed at the daring (or should we say <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dumb-luck-meets-dumb-criminals/">stupid</a>?) things car thieves will do to make some money. One of the most shocking examples recently comes via Tuscarawas County, Ohio where according to Times Reporter, two thieves made off with a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-rental-car-stolen/">2020 Dodge Charger</a> and a 2016 Chevy Camaro, only for the guy in the Mopar to wreck out most gloriously.</p>

<p>Per the report, the two suspects seemed to have a brilliant plan to steal the two American muscle cars from an insurance auction. During the night or maybe the early-morning hours, they got into the fenced-off storage yard and broke into the cars. It’s not clear from the report if they hacked the ignitions or were able to get the keys.</p>
<p>What we do know is when employees opened the gate to the storage yard, the suspects both sped out of the place like bats out of hell, catching everyone off guard. Those employees called 911, alerting local law enforcement.</p>
<p>Deputies spotted the Dodge Charger and gave chase, but the guy behind the wheel decided to push the Mopar past what police cruisers can normally do, hitting 163 mph, reportedly. However, he also over-estimated his driving capabilities at that speed, losing control of the sedan, which crashed into a utility pole.</p>
<p>As you can see from the photo, the Charger was in pretty sad shape. The suspect, a 28-year-old man from Columbus, was taken to the hospital, then transported to jail.</p>
<p>Law enforcement spotted the Camaro at the time of the Charger’s crash. It was later spotted in a couple other places west of the county, but was eventually located in a Walmart parking lot in Coshocton County, seemingly abandoned and in much better shape than the Dodge.</p>
