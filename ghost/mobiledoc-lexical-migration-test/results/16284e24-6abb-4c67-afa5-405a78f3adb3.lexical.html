<p>Contributing to charity is a wonderful thing, but even better is contributing to an excellent charitable cause while also being entered to win a cool car. That’s exactly what you get with these two drawings. One is for a <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1969 Chevrolet Camaro Pace Car</a>, the other for a <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1966-corvette-sting-ray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1966 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a>. You could chose to enter either drawing or both, just remember that as a Motorious reader we’re giving you a special code for more tickets for your charitable contribution. That promo code is WIN.</p>

<p>A lot of people already know all about the <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1969 Chevrolet Camaro Pace Car</a>, a special edition Z11 convertible with production limited to 3,675 units. The classic muscle car is definitely a collectible these days and would look fantastic sitting in your garage.</p>
<p>Wearing Dover White with Hugger Orange stripes and a Houndstooth Bucket Seat Deluxe Interior, these cars are quite distinct as well as good-looking. This car also packs a 396ci V8 with 325-horsepower, which really gets the muscle car moving. A TH400 automatic transmission makes this a vehicle you can easily drive, too.</p>

<p>Just as classic, the <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1966-corvette-sting-ray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1966 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a> is one of the most beloved versions of America’s sports car. This numbers-matching vehicle features a 427ci big block V8 and 4-speed manual transmission, making it a true driver’s car.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the Rally Red body with off-road exhaust, plus the black interior look fantastic. This ‘Vette has been the recipient of two NCRS Top Flight Awards with an average score of 96 points and a Bloomington Gold Certification, all within the last 4 years, so this is a ride you can take to shows and turn plenty of heads.</p>
