The guy who bought the Commodore VK Group A back in 1985 decided to store it at a friend’s house a year after buying it since he was going through a divorce. We could jump to conclusions about why, but you could as well and since we don’t have all the details, so we’ll leave it at that. Anyway, the friend agreed to take over the car payments but wanted to leave the vehicle registered to the original owner. Again, no info about why that was, but one could make some pretty interesting guesses."
