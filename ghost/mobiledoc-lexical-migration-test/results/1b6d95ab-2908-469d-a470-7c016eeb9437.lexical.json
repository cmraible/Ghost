Our second competitor, the Firebird, is sporting a high output 400ci V8 engine, the compression ratio of 10.75:1 is monstrous compared to the Demon’s 8.5:1. In terms of horsepower, the Firebird takes advantage with over 100 horsepower differences, that engine pushes out 335 horsepower.

Something went right for the Demon in round one with the Firebird falling behind slightly at 14.5 and the Demon taking the win with 14.2 seconds on the clock. Again the Demon kicks some tail with similar drag times and it's time for round three. After having already one the best out of three competitions the Demon decides to finish the job and blows his competition out of the water with its reliable 14.2 second quarter mile. Although this may not be the best representation of Mopar vs GM, it does speak wonders that the Demon, who had over 100 horsepower less than the Firebird, still won.",
