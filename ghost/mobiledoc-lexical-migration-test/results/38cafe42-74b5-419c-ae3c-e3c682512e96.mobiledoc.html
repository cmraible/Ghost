<hr>
<p>Everyone loves American muscle cars, even if someone says they don’t, if they’ve ever partaken of it. There’s something deeply satisfying about feeling a surge of power and (in most cases) letting those rear tires get all smokey. Maybe it’s that such power reminds us of freedom or it’s just all the endorphins getting released into our blood stream, but muscle cars are completely awesome.</p>
<p>However, muscle cars can also be pretty pricey, proving freedom isn’t truly free. That’s why we put together this list of the best muscle cars for under $25,000. This list is pretty inclusive, in part because the price threshold makes that a necessity, so it should please many and anger a fair number of people.</p>
<p>We included a couple of Australian muscle cars badged as Americans plus some non-traditional muscle options for good measure. Purists will argue some of these vehicles aren’t “real” muscle cars and they certainly can think that. But to someone else these cars could be a fantastic performance deal they didn’t know exists.</p>
<p>Which of the following rides do you consider to be the best muscle car for under $25,000?</p>
<h3 id="ford-mustang-50-lx"><strong>Ford Mustang 5.0 LX</strong></h3>

<p>Rolling in your 5.0 is iconic and pretty cheap these days, but don’t expect these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-7up-mustang/" rel="nofollow noopener">Foxbody Mustangs</a> to stay that way for long.</p>

<p>There seems to be no shortage of love for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1985-camaro-iroc-bat/" rel="nofollow noopener">IROC Z</a>, which helped resuscitate American muscle back in the 80s.

<p>While prices of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/modified-2015-dodge/" rel="nofollow noopener">newer Challenger</a> SRTs are pretty lofty, you can find a 2009 in reasonably good condition for under $25,000, providing some good tire-shredding fun.</p>

<p>Poor AMC not only had a sad demise, it still gets looked over when people start discussing muscle cars. The benefit of that is you can get a nice Javelin for cheap, so there’s that.</p>
<h3 id="1993-ford-svt-mustang-cobra"><strong>1993 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra</strong></h3>

<p>With this you would be getting the first SVT <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-ford-torino-stunning-show-car/">Ford</a> Mustang Cobra and the last Foxbody Mustang all in the same car. Imagine the possibilities.</p>

<p>If you want better handling without making modifications yet still crave a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/government-canceled-muscle/">classic muscle</a> car, this Pontiac could be your ticket.</p>

<p>A product of Holden, this Aussie turned American has a nice V8 and decent power on tap, especially if you get one of the later cars with the 6.0-liter engine.</p>
<h3 id="1970-mercury-cyclone-gt"><strong>1970 Mercury Cyclone GT</strong></h3>

    <figcaption>What’s The Best Muscle Car For Under $25,000?</figcaption>

<p>Don’t laugh at this choice because the ’70 Cyclone GT uses a 351ci V8, with two engine upgrade options, although those might push the budget beyond the $25,000 cap.</p>
<h3 id="gmc-syclone"><strong>GMC Syclone</strong></h3>

    <figcaption>What’s The Best Muscle Car For Under $25,000?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>No introduction is really needed for the Syclone, which proved back in the day small trucks could push big performance. Technically this isn’t a muscle “car” and purists will want to point that out, but whatever.</p>
<h3 id="new-edge-mustang-svt-cobra"><strong>New Edge Mustang SVT Cobra</strong></h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i56FrwOXckf3VFte3IGzZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motorious_297/4f9ee54ec4ad3492b3dc4550f5c3b27f" class="kg-image" alt="What&#x002019;s The Best Muscle Car For Under $25,000?

    <figcaption>What’s The Best Muscle Car For Under $25,000?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>People love to rip on New Edge Mustangs, but the SVT Cobras are good budget performance options. Plus, they have an independent rear suspension, which helps with not taking out crowds while leaving gatherings.</p>
<h3 id="dodge-stealth-rt"><strong>Dodge Stealth R/T</strong></h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tf..PqPC84zGxEhfggP7DQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motorious_297/72108fc1d42918c5475cac2e5936363a" class="kg-image" alt="What&#x002019;s The Best Muscle Car For Under $25,000?

    <figcaption>What’s The Best Muscle Car For Under $25,000?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>No doubt a controversial choice for many American muscle enthusiasts since the Stealth was really a Mitsubishi 3000GT. Still, the R/T pushes a stout 320-hp and has all-wheel drive, making it loads of fun.</p>
<h3 id="2010-chevy-camaro-ss"><strong>2010 Chevy Camaro SS</strong></h3>

<p>Despite a so-so reputation thanks to questionable styling and horrible rearward visibility, the 2010 Camaro SS is a true performance deal.</p>

<p>The short-lived Dodge Magnum was very niche and didn’t receive a lot of love. Thankfully the SRT8 was made and it’s the ultimate muscle wagon.</p>
<h3 id="amc-hornet-sc360"><strong>AMC Hornet SC/360</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, another truck on this list but it’s there for a good reason. The first generation of the F-150 Lightning was pretty good, but what you really want is a second-gen.</p>

<p>Made my Holden, this rebadged Pontiac is a performance monster if you get one with a V8. And yes, this has four doors, so some will argue it’s not a muscle car, but we’re choosing to ignore such “rules.”</p>
<p><strong>SN-95 Ford Mustang GT</strong></p>

<p>Yes, another sedan! The CTS-V is a performance legend and you can find one around the 2005 model year for under the $25,000 mark, which is a real performance deal.</p>

<p>Really, the Prowler should’ve had a V8 but it apparently wouldn’t fit in that narrow nose. Still the 253-hp from the 3.5-liter V6 isn’t bad and other than the lame front bumper this Mopar looks cool.</p>
<p>So, which of these budget muscle cars would you want to be parking in your garage? Leave a comment below and let us know.</p>
