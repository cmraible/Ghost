<p>Boy, it didn’t take long for the politicians to start backing away from the people’s law. The MP who said he’d put the legislation forward is trying to wriggle out of it, and Prescott says that it would encourage vigalantes. Vigilantes who sit at home, hoping that criminals would break in, presumably. Seems like rather a dull way to be a vigilante to me. Frankly, I think having a government who is more concerned with the rights of the law-abusing than the law-abiding is likely to promote vigilantes, but what does my opinion count? I’m not a politician.</p>
