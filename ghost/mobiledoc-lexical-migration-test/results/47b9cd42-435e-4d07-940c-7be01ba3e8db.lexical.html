<p>On this week’s <em>Movies vs. Capitalism</em>, Rivka and Frank are joined by <a href="https://elewoods.cool/">Ele Woods </a>(actor, writer, and comedian) to discuss the 1988 classic, <em>Working Girl</em>, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Melanie Griffith.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/c69b6135/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>The group unpacks how this movie is the prototypical “girl boss” film, how it brilliantly portrays the predatory male gaze dominant in 1980s cinema, and how Melanie Griffith’s voice is the original ASMR. Ele also shares why “maintain and mend” is her new anti-capitalist mantra, and Frank and Rivka discuss Bernie Sander’s recent media tour.</p>
