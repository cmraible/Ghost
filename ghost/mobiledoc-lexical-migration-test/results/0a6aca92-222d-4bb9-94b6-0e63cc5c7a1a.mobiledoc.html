<p>Normal people who are struggling to make their car payment consider options like selling their ride for something more affordable. Others would get a second job, sell some items, eliminate needless spending, or something of that nature. One woman in North Carolina decided the better idea was to steal her own Camaro, then have the insurance company pay off the loan.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out the awesome Rolls-Royce a dad made from wood for his son <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wooden-rolls-royce/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to an official release from North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, Tiffany Ann Littlejohn, 29, of Winston-Salem came up with what she no doubt thought was a brilliant scheme. However, she’s hardly the first person to think up such an idea, so investigators were able to sniff out the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the saddest part of this case was the Littlejohn had a Chevy Camaro LT. She went to all that trouble for a pretty basic Camaro without a proper V8. Just buying that car should qualify as some sort of crime.</p>
<p>Per the release, this scheme took place between November 10, 2020 and October 1, 2021. Surely Littlejohn decided at some point she had gotten away with the perfect crime and was feeling pretty smug. However, the gears of justice might turn slowly at times, but eventually when they do make their way around they can be crushing.</p>
<p>Now Littlejohn is facing one charge of insurance fraud and one charge of obtaining property by false pretense. Those are both felonies, so if she’s convicted she won’t be having a great time. Remember everyone, insurance fraud is not only wrong, it can come with some stiff penalties.</p>
<p>Considering insurance fraud can lead to increased premiums for those of us who carry insurance, it certainly isn’t a victimless crime. The N.C. Department of Insurance Criminal Investigations Division used this case to remind everyone to report fraud, which can be done anonymously. That should be true no matter where you live.</p>
