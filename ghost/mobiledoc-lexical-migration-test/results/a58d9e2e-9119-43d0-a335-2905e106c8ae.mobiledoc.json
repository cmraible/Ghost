A lot of people looking at the Model Y also consider the fat pony crossover, helping to blow up claims that it’s really hardcore Mustang enthusiasts who are interested in it. While there are probably a few traditional Mustang owners who have also purchased a Mach-E, it’s far more popular with those who love have the shiny new thing to show off to the neighbors."
