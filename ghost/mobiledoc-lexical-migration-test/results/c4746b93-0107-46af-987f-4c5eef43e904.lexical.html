<p>There’s a tower of receipts that showcases all the new parts, too, of which many were shipped from the United Kingdom. Certain components were used to tastefully modify the <a href="https://www.garagekeptmotors.com/vehicles/803/1967-austin-mini-cooper-s?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Cooper S</a> both visually and mechanically. However, if you are of the purist persuasion, all of these ‘modifications’ can be reversed to provide a factory standard car. <br><br>Cabin additions include the fitment of a removable Safety Devices roll bar, LeCarra steering wheel, Smiths tachometer, and bucket seats. In addition to the mindful interior and exterior modifications, the original 1275cc engine and transmission were rebuilt to the highest possible standard.</p>

<p>Some of the notable engine bay components are new A and E pistons, leaded valve seats, new valves, ARP bolts, and Longman GT7 SPVP3 Camshaft. Also, a radiator with “tropical fan” was added to prevent the Mini from overheating in humid driving conditions. The dynamo generator was replaced with an alternator, and an Odyssey battery was installed.</p>
