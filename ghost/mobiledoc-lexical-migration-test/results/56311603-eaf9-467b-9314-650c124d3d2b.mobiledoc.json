          ", this car is deemed the “Project 11:59 – The Closest Thing To Midnight.” It takes but a minute to see where this Camaro got its title from and to understand just how fitting the nickname is. This Camaro project was started in late 2015 with the hopes and dreams of creating a piece of machinery that would turn heads, steal glances, and leave jaws on the floor. The owner has an extensive list of modifications and parts that were purchased for the build. Every receipt is in his possession and will be shared with the buyer at full disclosure. Over $175,000 has been invested in this project and the current bid is set at $150,000."

It’s also equipped with a Gear Vendors overdrive kit to allow for enjoyable highway cruising. Under the hood, you’ll notice several stylish carbon fiber and billet pieces that will stun audiences at your local car show. This 1969 Chevy Camaro Pro Touring sits on 19x12 and 18x9 Boze wheels wrapped in Nitto tires (345/30/19 and 275/35/18). It rides on a new Ride-Tech suspension system made up of adjustable coilover shocks and a four-link rear. Other notable features include carbon fiber inner wheel fenders, a carbon fiber closeout panel, billet hood hinges, and custom billet fender braces."
