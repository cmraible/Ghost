The most obvious change was replacing the hidden headlights with inset, single-pod headlights, and since Chevy stopped making Corvette convertibles in 1975, the fact this one is a convertible is also special. Other styling changes included widening the fenders by six inches to accentuate the C3's already-curvaceous lines and a powerdome hood to hint at the extra power lurking under the hood. The only parts of the production C3 that carried over appear to be the rear bumper and the windshield frame."
