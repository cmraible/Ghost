<p>Movie cars are usually highly collectible items. Sometimes they cost a small fortune to obtain, especially if it is a rare example. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/shelby-gt500-win/">Ford Mustang Shelby GT500</a> in the movie <em>I Am Legend</em> starring Will Smith is not a rare <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/ford-mustang/">Mustang</a> by any means, but it just 1 of 6 built for production and the only surviving car. </p>

<p>The Shelby GT500 has been <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Ford-Mustang-MOVIE-CAR/283983938421?hash=item421ec30375:g:LLgAAOSwgCxe8bs4#89698767896gyfjmhgvhvtuy">listed on eBay</a> with less than a full day left to bid. As of this writing the current bid is at $27,000 (with reserve not met). While the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1965-mustang-xcross/">Mustang</a> does not come with a warranty, it has all documentation proving its movie role. Even more, the late Carroll Shelby signed the dashboard.</p>
<p>This would make a great collectible for any <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/">car enthusiast</a>, and many would recognize the car right off the bat since the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby</a> did play a big role in the movie. Often, it is listed in top 10 lists of movie <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/ford-mustang/">Mustangs</a>. Even better, no accident history and a mere 6,605 miles on the clock. Plus, after all this time, the car has been kept in storage. </p>

<p>For some reason, it has been hard to find a buyer for the car. The <em>I Am Legend</em> movie producer was a friend of Carroll Shelby's, and he kept the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/382639/2020-1967-shelby-gt500-drag-race">GT500</a> in his private collection. For reasons unknown, he decided to let go of it and sold it to a New Milford Motors out of Connecticut. Back in November 2019, this same exact Shelby GT500 was listed by that car dealer with an asking price of $150,000.<br><br>Currently, the GT500 is listed here on eBay. As mentioned above, current bid is at $27,000 with the reserve not met yet. The dealer also has the car up for grabs on their own website, and it is listed for just $85,000. Only one year has passed, and the price has been slashed considerably making this movie car quite a bargain.</p>

<p>As the only surviving car from the movie, it has been registered as a "stunt car" but wasn't actually used for any stunts. This GT500 was used for beauty shots and close-ups, and helped promote the movie. Maybe somebody will finally snag the car for a discounted price and net themselves an unmistakable and recognizable movie car. </p>
