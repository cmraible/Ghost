For many, their vehicle is part of their livelihood, so having it swiped by a crook really hurts. While police departments are overloaded and prosecutors seem reluctant to really go after car thieves, the problem has spun out of control in many areas. That’s what makes this story of a guy fighting back by tracking his stolen pickup truck using an Apple AirTag so amazing."

News outlets have also covered accusations of stalkers dropping them in purses or other items so they can stalk people.
