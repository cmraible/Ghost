<p>SEMA, the Specialty Equipment Market Association, just announced that the show (as well as AAPEX) will not be taking place in 2020 due to Covid-19 concerns. The largest automotive aftermarket trade show is the latest victim in a long list of cancelled events. The show was planned from Tuesday, November 3rd through November 6th of this year.</p>
<p>Event organizers and industry members have been working around the clock to see if the event could take place this November, bu have decided to pull the plug due to mounting uncertainty. Many exhibitors were uncertain of attending the event already, but now the show has been called off officially. With the unfortunate decision, SEMA expects this will "bring clarity to an uncertain picture and will help exhibitors, attendees and partners plan accordingly."</p>
<p>“The SEMA Show is committed to furthering businesses in the automotive specialty equipment market, and to providing manufacturers and buyers with the best opportunity to connect, promote new products and discover new trends,” said Chris Kersting, SEMA president and CEO.“We appreciate the spirit, hard work and innovation our industry puts into the SEMA Show each year. While we are disappointed circumstances prevent us from hosting the Show in November, we look forward to getting everyone together in 2021 for another outstanding event.”</p>
<p>A recent SEMA Show survey showed interest in holding a possible virtual trade show with live elements. In the official press release, SEMA will be working with industry members to gauge interest on certain alternatives.</p>
<p>Those who placed exhibitor booth deposits and attendee registration fees for this year's SEMA show will be issued full refunds.</p>
