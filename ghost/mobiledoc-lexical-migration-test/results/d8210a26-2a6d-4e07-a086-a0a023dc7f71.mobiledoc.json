The featured car is the first car and the prototype. It is based off a 1973 Alfa Romeo Giulia GT Junior. Currently, it is powered by a Totem electric motor, producing the equivalent of 518hp using a 50.4Kw battery. Riccardo did tell me the production cars will be upgraded to a 590hp engine using a 60.9Kw battery pack. He claims the new motors will be capable of propelling the car from 0-60 in 2.0 seconds vs. it's current 3.4 seconds. With so much power, braking is equally as important and that is provided by "

To assist in maintaining that old school feel, Riccardo and his team developed a series of speakers that mimic the sound of a traditional engine. Even more so, you can choose from a variety of engine types. We tested the American car rumble. You can hear that in the video below. "

The team is made up of top designers, fabricators, suppliers, and engineers. Creating such detailed work is time consuming, so much so, the wait period for delivery is approximately 3 years. The sale price is also not for the faint of heart. Expect to pay in the upper $500K's to low $600K's depending on the customizations. The price includes the donor car. Totem does require a 25 percent deposit up front, 50 percent half way through production, and the remaining 50 percent with completion of the build. "
