Still, some people have managed to royally screw up when they’re trying to capitalize off the Chevy’s aesthetics. Thankfully, Jeff honed in on what makes it look good, then accentuated that further. The hue of the blue paint paired with chrome trim and a red leather interior just looks undeniably wonderful. Even more amazing, Jeff did the paint and everything else in his garage, rather than sending the car out to a shop."
