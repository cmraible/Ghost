I often like to go along with developers when they implement motion controls but the gameplay is just a hot mess. Each beast feels clunky to control, often leading me to be stuck and awkwardly having to reverse whilst my camera pointed in a completely obtuse direction. Not only that, but the depth perception of the attacks does not convey well to the player, leading to a cumbersome trial and error approach. Honestly, the Divine Beasts made the game look pretty for the marketing but they just needed more time in the oven. "
