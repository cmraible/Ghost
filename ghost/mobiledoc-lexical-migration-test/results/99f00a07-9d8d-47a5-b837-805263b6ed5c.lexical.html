<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Last week, Joe Biden was about to appoint a corporate Democrat to the nation’s top health care post. Then we published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/possible-hhs-pick-shielded-nursing/">major expose</a> on her record helping health care lobbyists and the situation abruptly changed. Now, Biden has nominated a progressive to the post — <strong>and <a href="https://prospect.org/cabinet-watch/where-we-are-at-on-biden-cabinet-picks/"><strong>today’s American Prospect</strong></a> explicitly credits <em>The Daily Poster</em> for playing a pivotal role in changing the entire situation</strong>.</p>
<p>Clearly, we are having a major impact on national politics — and now we’re trying to build out a full newsroom. Because we are grassroots-funded, the only way we can do that is if free subscribers decide to become supporting subscribers. <strong>So here’s my personal request of you</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>PLEASE click here to become a supporting subscriber RIGHT NOW</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>I want to reiterate — we’re on the verge of being able to build a full newsroom for 2021, so if you’ve thought of becoming a supporting subscriber, <strong>please do not wait</strong>. <a href="#/portal/signup">Do it now — it really is that important</a>.</p>
<p>When we started <em>The Daily Poster </em>earlier this year, we had a theory: if you do hard-hitting accountability journalism on both parties, you can make a positive impact on American politics. Now, it’s happening — we’ve played a big role in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-frantically-backtracks-after/">backing Biden away from GOP talking points</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-limit-cuomos-corporate-immunity/">limiting corporate immunity laws</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gop-lawmaker-leads-fight-to-get-his/">exposing Republican corruption</a> and now shaping the national debate about one a key Cabinet appointment.</p>
<p>As we’ve broken open more and more stories, we’ve faced increasingly intense efforts to bully us into silence. That’s not surprising — powerful politicians and corporations want loyal propaganda, and want to crush journalism that holds power accountable.</p>
<p>We’re not going to be intimidated — instead, we’re trying to expand, and the only way we can do that is if you become a supporting subscriber.</p>

<p>Let me admit something: when we launched this project, I wasn’t sure it could be successful. I figured we’d give it a try, but I didn’t have great expectations because I know how hard it is to build something from scratch. But after all the against-the-odds successes we’ve had, I know that if we are able to build out a whole newsroom, we can create lasting change. For real.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering this request. Let’s do this.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
