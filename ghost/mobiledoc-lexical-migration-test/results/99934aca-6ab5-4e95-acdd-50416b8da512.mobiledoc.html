<p>Okay, maybe “new” look isn’t accurate. How about “borrowed” look?</p>
<p>Yes, the Facebookification of Twitter continues.</p>
<p>In an announcement posted this morning <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/coming-soon-a-whole-new-you-in-your-twitter-profile">on the company’s blog</a>, Twitter designer David Bellona showed us the future of Twitter profiles. And that future looks an awful lot like the present for that <em>other</em> large social network.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/twitter-profile.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-36792" alt="twitter-profile" src="__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/twitter-profile-300x238.jpg" width="300" height="238" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/twitter-profile-300x238.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/twitter-profile.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Check out First Lady Michelle Obama’s revamped Twitter profile on the right. Much like Facebook, the header image is larger, and is overlapped by the user’s photo. That photo is found in the top-left portion of the profile, above the content; coincidentally, this is also where Facebook profile photos are located.</p>
<p>Oh, and tweets can be “pinned,” much like status updates can be “highlighted” on Facebook.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Twitter hasn’t brought anything original to the table. The company plans to introduce a feature that makes your most engaged-with tweets “slightly larger” than the rest. There will also be some fancier filtering options available on profile pages, including the ability to view all tweets, tweets with pictures/video, or tweets mixed with replies to other users.</p>
<p>Still, it’s tough to shake just how similar Twitter’s new look is to Facebook’s profile pages. Take a look below at the profiles of tween sensation/adult nightmare Zac Efron, for example.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/facebook-twitter.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36793" alt="facebook-twitter" src="__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/facebook-twitter.png" width="849" height="1000" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/facebook-twitter.png 849w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/04/facebook-twitter-254x300.png 254w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" /></a></p>

<p>They look a lot alike, don’t they?</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see if Facebook has anything to say once Twitter really starts rolling these new-look profiles out. To start, they’re only available to a small subset of users, including celebrities like Channing Tatum, John Legend and Floyd Mayweather.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that this new look will only show up on the Web for the time being. It’s unknown at this point if Twitter plans to adapt its new profile design for clients like the official Twitter mobile app, or TweetDeck. We’ll keep our ears to the ground and let you know if we hear anything.</p>
