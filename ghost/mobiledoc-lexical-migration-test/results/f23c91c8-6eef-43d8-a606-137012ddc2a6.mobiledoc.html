<p>Good things are happening! The Federal Trade Commission just proposed a new rule that could help millions of workers win higher wages. A new state millionaire tax spearheaded by unions and community organizers just went into effect in Massachusetts. Also, the prospect of utilities investing in decarbonization and ditching natural gas is looking brighter than ever. Meanwhile, abortion pills have become more accessible, and public pressure has pushed the postal service to electrify its fleet.</p>

<h3 id="a-tale-of-two-regulators">A Tale Of Two Regulators</h3>
<p><em>The Lever </em>has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/watch-now-pete-buttigieg-was-warned-about-southwests-flight-issues/">said</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-how-the-airline-industry-became-a-living-nightmare/">a lot</a> about how Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg ignored pleas from state officials and thousands of customer complaints before Southwest Airlines‚Äô mass flight cancellations ruined the holidays for millions of travelers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one top Biden administration official is showing what regulating should look like. Under the leadership of chair Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1147138052/workers-noncompete-agreements-ftc-lina-khan-ban">just unveiled</a> a rule that would bar companies from restricting their employees‚Äô ability to work for rivals. Millions of workers could benefit: A 2021 report shows that noncompete laws ‚Äî which affect as much <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/noncompete-agreements/">45 percent</a> of U.S. private sector workers ‚Äî are a central driver of stagnating pay for middle-income workers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResearch shows that employers‚Äô use of noncompetes to restrict workers‚Äô mobility significantly suppresses workers‚Äô wages ‚Äî even for those not subject to noncompetes, or subject to noncompetes that are unenforceable under state law,‚Äù Elizabeth Wilkins, the FTC‚Äôs policy planning officer director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Since being sworn into office in 2021, Khan has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/01/1011907383/new-ftc-chair-lina-khan-wants-to-redefine-monopoly-power-for-the-age-of-big-tech">advocated</a> for stronger antitrust regulation and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/09/ftc-chair-lina-m-khan-testifies-senate-judiciary-subcommittee-antitrust-competition-policy-consumer-rights">launched challenges</a> to mergers in the health care, energy, defense, and digital market industries.</p>

<h3 id="organized-and-ready-to-tax-the-rich">Organized And Ready To Tax The Rich</h3>
<p>Last November, Massachusetts‚Äô voters <a href="https://labornotes.org/2022/12/millionaire-tax-wins-massachusetts">approved</a> the <a href="https://www.fairsharema.com/">Fair Share</a> state constitutional amendment that introduced a new <a href="https://labornotes.org/2022/12/millionaire-tax-wins-massachusetts">millionaire tax</a> ‚Äî a four percent surcharge on annual income over $1 million.</p>
<p>The new law went into <a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/massachusetts-fair-share-amendment-signed-into-law/">effect</a> January 1, 2023, and while only 20,000 households will be affected by the new rate, it will generate nearly $2 billion a year in new revenue, with a portion dedicated to public education and transportation.</p>
<p>The millionaire tax was spearheaded by <a href="https://twitter.com/raiseupma">Raise Up Massachusetts</a>, a coalition of <a href="https://massteacher.org/current-initiatives/fairshare-ma">unions</a> and community organizations that invested heavily in organizing its members to build its campaign.</p>
<p>With dues from coalition members, Raise Up hired 140 organizers to knock doors and raise awareness early in the campaign last summer. By the end, the campaign managed to knock on nearly one million doors ‚Äî a record-breaking effort that the coalition says was central to the millionaire tax‚Äôs success.</p>

<h3 id="clean-energy-is-cheaper-than-new-gas-plants">Clean Energy Is Cheaper Than New Gas Plants</h3>
<p>Gas-fired power plants currently deliver more electricity in the country than any other energy source. According to a Sierra Club <a href="https://coal.sierraclub.org/the-problem/dirty-truth-greenwashing-utilities">report</a> analyzing utilities‚Äô actions toward clean transitions, <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/charts-utilities-sticking-with-fossil-fuels-despite-climate-pledges">most</a> utilities have stuck with gas when planning investments, despite climate pledges.</p>
<p>However, as a result of tax credits made available by the passage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last year, the investment terrain could be fundamentally altered to favor decarbonized energy portfolios of solar, wind, energy storage, and flexible consumer demand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe math on the next right investment has changed,‚Äù <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/with-new-tax-credits-clean-energy-beats-gas-plants-almost-every-time">said</a> Lauren Shwisberg, author of a new analysis of the IRA by a decarbonization-focused think tank. ‚Äã‚ÄúDecisions that are based on pre-IRA assumptions may no longer be what provides the greatest savings for customers.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the analysis, if clean energy plants receive the maximum tax credits allowed ‚Äî a 50 percent credit on the upfront investment ‚Äî they will financially outcompete 99 percent of the gas plants to be built between now and 2035. Still, even if clean energy plants receive only a 30 percent credit, they will still beat 93 percent of gas plants.</p>
<h3 id="abortion-pills-become-more-accessible">Abortion Pills Become More Accessible</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/03/1146860433/the-fda-finalizes-rule-expanding-the-availability-of-abortion-pills">finalized</a> a rule expanding the availability of abortion pills to include local drugstores and large pharmacy chains such as CVS Health and Walgreens.</p>
<p>Abortion pills are used in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/health/abortion-pills-us.html">more than half</a> of pregnancy terminations in the country. Until now, mifepristone ‚Äî the first pill in the two-drug abortion medication process ‚Äî could only be offered by a select few mail-order pharmacies. In states with abortion bans, pharmacies are still barred from providing the pills.</p>
<p>In December 2021, the FDA announced it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/health/abortion-pills-fda.html">lift</a> requirements that patients acquire mifepristone in person from a health provider. The lift allowed telemedicine abortion services to conduct medical evaluations online or by phone in order to prescribe pills by mail. According to the FDA, more than 3.7 million people have used mifepristone since its approval.</p>
<h3 id="fossil-fuel-ads-are-getting-banned">Fossil Fuel Ads Are Getting Banned</h3>
<p>Vox Media ‚Äî which owns <em>New York Magazine</em> and its namesake site <em>Vox</em> ‚Äî is <a href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2023/01/04/vox-media-formalizes-ban-on-fossil-fuel-ads">formalizing</a> an advertising policy that states the company will no longer accept ad dollars from the fossil fuel industry and companies that mine nonrenewable resources. The policy will also apply to any lobbyist group ‚Äúwhose purpose is to support fossil fuel companies.‚Äù</p>
<p>The policy could set a new precedent for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-spin/">corporate media</a>: It sends the message that news outlets‚Äô practice of accepting ad revenue from fossil fuel companies while covering the climate crisis represents a conflict of interest and should be barred. <em>Semafor</em>‚Äôs climate editor recently <a href="https://twitter.com/BillSpindle/status/1598735516672954385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598735516672954385%7Ctwgr%5E8e92c6498a7874924b3d7d88371f0a96922d8bb1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fmedia%2Fsemafor-climate-editor-exits-after-complaining-bosses-sites-over-dependence-on-chevron-sponsorship">left the publication</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BillSpindle/status/1599118778863783937">writing</a> that his time with the outlet was ‚Äúmarred, sadly, by an overdependence on Chevron sponsorship.‚Äù</p>
<p>Standing up against corporate influence, especially from the fossil fuel industry, is a vital part of running a newsroom, and it‚Äôs why <em>The Lever</em> is a fully reader-supported investigative outlet.</p>

<h3 id="the-postal-service-is-going-electric">The Postal Service Is Going Electric</h3>
<p>Last year, Louis Dejoy, Trump-appointed chief officer of the United States Postal Service (USPS), planned to replace the aging USPS fleet with gas-guzzling delivery trucks. But after waves of backlash, the Postal Service is <a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2022/1220-usps-intends-to-deploy-over-66000-electric-vehicles-by-2028.htm">now committed</a> to significantly decarbonizing its fleet of more than 230,000 automobiles ‚Äî the largest single portion of the government‚Äôs nearly 650,000-vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>In addition to procuring <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-fleets/us-postal-service-commits-to-buy-66-000-evs-finally">66,000</a> electric delivery vehicles through 2028, the USPS announced a new goal of acquiring only electric delivery vehicles by 2026. The agency plans to build tens of thousands of charging stations across the country in the next five years.</p>
