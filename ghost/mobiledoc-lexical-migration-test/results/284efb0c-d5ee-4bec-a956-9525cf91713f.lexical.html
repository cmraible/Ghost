<p>As Lamborghinis have grown in both popularity and production volume in recent years, it might be getting harder for discerning collectors to find examples that haven't been abused or passed around collections. What makes this <a href="https://www.speedmotorsusa.com/vehicles/53/1992-lamborghini-diablo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">1992 Lamborghini Diablo</a> incredibly special is the fact that it was imported from Lamborghini's homeland of Italy, and it's currently for sale through <a href="https://www.speedmotorsusa.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Speed Motors</a> in South Florida.</p>

<p>Most classic Lamborghinis are well-preserved and are in great shape, but this Superfly Yellow is in stunningly pristine condition thanks to the fact that it has just 1434 actual kilometers (less than 900 miles) on the odometer. Even at a standstill, the Diablo looks like it's driving 200 mph with its wedge design and massive rear spoiler, and tucked just behind the seats is a 5.7-liter V12 with a five-speed manual transmission to ensure this car is as fun to drive as it to look at.</p>
<p>When it comes to styling, the Diablo is to the '90s that the Countach was to the '70s and '80s. Ask children of the '90s what car posters they had on their walls, and the Lamborghini Diablo is likely to be one of the more popular answers. Even 30 years after its creation, the Diablo is still a stunning supercar, and this rarely used example is even more impressive. The best part about this Diablo are Lamborghini's iconic five-hole wheels, while the inside is like a luxurious racecar with quilted leather door panels and black leather seats with yellow piping.</p>
