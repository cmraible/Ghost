<p>Here in America, it is very common to see automotive enthusiasts concern themselves mainly with big horsepower numbers, muscle car styling, and straight-line speed with a distinct disinterest for luxury and comfort. This applies to the younger crowd of modern muscle car fans but also to the classic car community whose main focus is usually either speed or restoration. However, this divide between luxury and muscle has been shrinking as the high-powered pony and muscle cars of today begin to expand their variety of interior and luxury options. So what if you're one of the few enthusiasts who can truly appreciate the best of all worlds?</p>
