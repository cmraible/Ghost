<hr>
<p>We bring to you a video so insane you have to see it to completely believe the story. A Fox Body Mustang participated in an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/street-racing-mustangs-power-pole/">illegal street race</a>, crashing in such a horrific way it was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-wrecks-out-big-on-drag-strip/">torn in two</a>. By the looks of the surroundings and people’s accents, we’re thinking this was somewhere in the Southeast United States, but no location is given so that’s just a guess. Plus, it’s stated in the video the drivers are from Mississippi and New Orleans.</p>

<p>This Ford Mustang seems questionable at best. That’s not meant to be a dig on all <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-block-fox-body-daughter/">Fox Bodies</a> – there are some beautiful examples out there. However, this one has definitely seen better days a long time ago. There are rust bubbles highlighted by the streetlights, wavy body panels, and interesting mods visible in the video.</p>
<p>Things get even more interesting when the driver’s buddies pick up the rear end and move the car over a bit, probably to straighten it out. Why not do that under the Ford’s own power? Would it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-crashes-house/">break</a> if you tried? That could be entirely true, but flogging it in a high-speed street race will be just fine.</p>

<p>We feel like this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-racing-mustang-wrecks/">race</a> is the clash of the rusty titans or something like that. After both drivers hit it, the Fox Body Mustang gets a little squirrely in the rear, then it swerves sharply to the right and the little pony hits a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/street-racing-mustangs-power-pole/">power pole</a>. Why do these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/another-mustang-power-pole/">Mustangs always hit power poles</a>? Do they want to be electrified that badly?</p>
<p>This isn’t the first janky Fox Body Mustang we’ve seen crash so badly while drag racing it’s been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-wrecks-out-big-on-drag-strip/">torn in two</a>. We covered another incident at a track where the safety protocols seemed…questionable. Let it suffice to say a roll cage in these ponies might be more than just a good idea.</p>

<p>According to the video, the driver only broke his jaw, lost some teeth, and broke a shoulder. He fared much better than the car, that’s for sure. Evidently, this race was for $1,600. Why aren’t they racing for pink slips? Probably because neither driver wants to inherit the other person’s crappy rust bucket.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6Xvvnsv150" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
