But most importantly, Nintendo has a new president!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo’s New President</span></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1718\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-New-President-2.png?resize=623%2C576\" alt=\"Nintendo New President\" width=\"623\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-New-President-2.png?w=623&amp;ssl=1 623w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-New-President-2.png?resize=300%2C277&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s right, Tatsumi Kimishima has officially stepped down as CEO of Nintendo and 46 year old Shuntaro Furukawa. Furukawa was a board member for both Nintendo Japan and The Pokémon Company for many years and knows the ins and outs of both companies very well. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satoru Shibata Stepping Down</span></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1719\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Satoru Shibata\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you don&#8217;t know who Satoru Shibata is, he was the president of Nintendo Europe and appeared in many European versions of the Nintendo Directs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;s leaving Nintendo. In fact, he is being recalled back to Nintendo Japan to be a board member and director. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo Switch Online Reconfirmed for September</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo has reconfirmed the new Switch online program for September 2018 but did not say anything else on the matter. One can assume that they&#8217;re waiting to reveal all the details at E3 or in its own Direct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo also didn&#8217;t say anything about Super Smash Bros. other than it is still planned to release this year, but I&#8217;m still a firm believer that it&#8217;ll release alongside the Online program.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo’s Mobile Plans</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember the announcement of Mario Kart Tour? Well, That&#8217;s still on track to release within Nintendo’s new fiscal year (April 26, 2018 &#8211; March, 2019). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo also stated that there will be more than just Mario Kart Tour on mobile, so keep an eye out for more announcements there.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on the Nintendo Switch, make sure to </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/switchaboo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like us on Facebook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and follow us on Twitter @switchaboonews.
