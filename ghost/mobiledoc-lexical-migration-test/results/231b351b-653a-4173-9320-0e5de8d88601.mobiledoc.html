<p><a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10683&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This classic</a> started life as an original C-code 1966 Ford Mustang fastback, and the car went under the knife for a recent rotisserie restoration. Finished in a brilliant red and topped with painted white stripes, the body is in outstanding condition. Even more, it was recently highly polished so the paint shines like a diamond. Open the doors to reveal an immaculate black interior.</p>
<p>Powering the car is a 289-cubic-inch V8 topped with an original Ford Tri-Power carburetor setup, found Ford's high-performance catalog. An automatic transmission sends power down to the rear wheels. </p>
