<p>Collector cars come in a myriad of forms. From classics to hot rods, there’s no right or wrong way or rule book on how one should be done. Although, many of us enthusiasts do have our checklists we use to sift through our options and there is no doubt there are winning formulas. A recipe, if you will.

<p>Introduced late in the pony car game, the Dodge Challenger was not so much about being revolutionary, although it was, but more about making the absolute best pony car. The two series, available in three different models, were fitted with nearly every Mopar engine available. From a 225 cubic-inch Straight-6 all the way up to the legendary 426 cubic-inch 7.0-liter Hemi rated at 425-horsepower, with the 390-hp 440 cubic-inch 7.2-liter Six-Pack being the largest displacement and one of the more bragged about performance options.</p>

<p>Rare is the first word to come to mind when discussing this tuned 2004 Chevrolet Regency RST Sport Truck. After all, it is a limited-edition, special-conversion of the Chevy Silverado SWB that you don’t see kicking around car lots or even auctions all that often. Adding to its desirability is the fact Chip Foose designed this conversion, a fact that alone will have some people sold immediately.</p>
