This is especially true if the vehicle is a \"no sale\" as the consignor is on the hook for transportation to the venue and then back after the auction.\n3. **Flexibility** - Technology allows the use of alerts on particular vehicles making a better use of time as compared to being on site watching vehicles cross the block that are of no interest to the buyer.\n4.  **Leveraging a larger car community** - Platforms such as Bring-a-Trailer allow commenting which provides information and sometimes specific expertise from a worldwide audience.\n\n# Cons\n1. **No physical inspection** - There is no substitute for a personal physical inspection. While websites offer numerous photographs, videos and detailed descriptions there are always opportunities for errors.\n2. **Missed comradery** - Many of the annual auction events provide an opportunity for enthusiasts to get together. These events have become a highly anticipated pilgrimage to the hobby and a chance to bond with like-minded individuals."
