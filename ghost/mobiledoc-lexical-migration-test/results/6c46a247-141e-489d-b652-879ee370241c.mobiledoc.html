Officers found large amounts of fentanyl and cash in the car after a chase ended. Now the Corvette involved is heading for police auction.</p>

<p>42 year old Christopher McDaniel brought some attention to himself when he was asleep in his Corvette. After the police responded, he decided to flee, and was arrested and charged with drug charges and resisting arrest. Florida is pretty aggressive with vehicle seizures when the car is used during the commission of a crime.</p>
<p>"Not only do we close down poison peddler businesses but we will also seize their vehicles," Sheriff Rick Staly said about this criminals and another similar incident. "Between these two poison peddlers there was enough fentanyl to kill 15,000 people.”</p>
<p>They’re making it very clear, if they can’t get through to them with fines and jail time, they’re coming after the criminals’ cars.</p>
<p>"If you don’t want to be on the Sheriff’s High Interest Target list, then I suggest you get the hell out of Flagler County because we are coming for you next, your profits and your vehicles.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the Panhandle of Florida, a seized Corvette is being used by an Escambia police department for community outreach and recruiting purposes.</p>
