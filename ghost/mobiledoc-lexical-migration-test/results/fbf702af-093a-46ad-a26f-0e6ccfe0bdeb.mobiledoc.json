It starts with the coveted Plum Crazy paint and that fact this is a convertible, not a coupe. Chrome on the wheel opening moldings and exhaust tips really flaunts what this Dodge has. It rides on rally wheels with Goodyear Polyglas tires. You’ll find the black leather interior features bucket seats, pistol grip shifter, Rallye Instrument Cluster, rim blow steering wheel, plus a center console with wood grain tips. There’s even an AM radio with 8-track player, plus a remote driver exterior mirror."
