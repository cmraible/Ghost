          "Barn find cars can definitely be controversial. Some are suspicious of anyone who claims to have discovered a vehicle sitting in a barn for decades, sadly because some of these situations are obviously staged. Others get all worked up over why cars which have been left in garages, sheds, and even basements are called “barn finds.” We supposed it’s a collective term used out of ease, because if we constantly changed what we called abandoned or neglected cars, nobody would know what anyone was referring to."

          "However you feel about the whole barn find phenomena is the collector car hobby, it’s unarguably nice to see an old classic get a thorough washing. That’s what we get in the video included with this article as a barn find Porsche 911 E Targa which is filthy is cleaned up nicely. Not only that, the car gets some restoration work done, repairing damage either done before it was parked for all those years or that happened as it just sat."

Still, there’s a fair amount of grime to take off, something a good washing and clay bar do quite well. The interior might be worse, thanks to some mold taking up residence."

Since this is an E, it came with the larger engine. That didn’t make it a fire-breathing performance vehicle, but it’s still something nice to take on a Sunday cruise of country roads. Plus, someone added a nice Whale Tail."
