Under the black convertible top, the interior is upholstered in red and white material and features bright chrome accents, a theme that carries over from the white exterior finish. Despite a high-standard restoration that took place less than 3-miles ago, the car is in less than perfect condition but the blemishes are so small that they need to be pointed out to draw any attention.",
