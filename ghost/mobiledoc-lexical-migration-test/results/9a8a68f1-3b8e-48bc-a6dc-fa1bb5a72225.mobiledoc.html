<p>It’s always fun to see unexpected matchups at the drag strip. We’re not saying a 2nd-gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/acura-nsx-get-flogged/">Acura NSX</a> has never raced a 6th-gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/identity-fraud-camaro-zl1/">Chevy Camaro ZL1</a> before, just it’s a thing you usually don’t see on the internet. That’s why this video of the potent American muscle car facing off against the technologically-advanced Japanese supercar is so interesting. We’ve seen plenty of these racing Shelbys and Hellcats, but this is something different with an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcats-nissan-gt-rs/">American muscle vs Japanese sports car</a> showdown.</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nitro-ss-chevelle-boasts-performance/">blistering performance</a>, the 6th-gen Camaro ZL1 has it in spades. A supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 V8 produces 650-horsepower and 650 lb.-ft. of tire-destroying torque. You can get it either with a 6-speed manual or an automatic with paddle shifters. Magnetic Ride Control and a performance suspension specifically tuned for it are also included, making the muscle car quite the threat both on a straightaway and in turns. However, this thing isn’t exactly lightweight, tipping the scale at a stout 3,907 lbs.</p>
<p>Some people will take issue with us calling the 2nd-gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1995-acura-nsx-is-japans-greatest-supercar-creation/">Acura NSX</a> a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/porsche-reveals-secret-hypercars/">supercar</a>. Those people think supercars are now hypercars or are so incredibly unattainable only the wealthiest can afford them. They’ll also tell you a Nissan GT-R isn’t a supercar. Well, they can believe what they want.</p>

<p>Anyway, the current NSX is an interesting vehicle, and that’s not all good or bad. With a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 and an electric motor it puts out 573-hp and 476 lb.-ft. of torque. Yes, it’s a hybrid, something we’ve seen done before with supercars like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/laferrari-out-of-snow/">LaFerrari</a> and Porsche 918, so we know it can be a potent setup. Sending power to the rear wheels is a 9-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. But wait, there’s more, because technically the NSX is an all-wheel-drive car. Twin electric motors drive the front wheels. As you might suspect, all that hardware isn’t light, meaning the 2nd-gen NSX is pretty portly at 3,878 lbs.</p>
<p>So there you have it, two pretty powerful (by today’s standards) yet heavy performance cars, one with rear-wheel drive and the other using all-wheel drive along with an interesting hybrid powertrain. It’s not such a straightforward matchup, so the only thing left is to watch and see which one shreds the other in the quarter mile.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZCqQRGVCm0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
