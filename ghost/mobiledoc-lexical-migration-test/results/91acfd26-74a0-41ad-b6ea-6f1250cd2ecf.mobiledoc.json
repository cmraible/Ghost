According to a local news report, the crash took place around 5:45 pm on January 10 on Route 13 at the intersection with Commerce Circle. Police say the Ford and a Chevy sedan collided, causing the Mustang to split open like a pinata."

The rear axle, with the wheels still attached, was thrown beyond the sidewalk on some grass easily over 100 feet away. The rest of the rear end of the Mustang appeared to be strewn along the ground, so it looks to have pretty much disintegrated."

We wish someone had video of that, because it sounds borderline unbelievable, but a search has turned up nothing. However, you’ll notice the grass around the rear axle does look charred in the video."

Sadly, incidents like this only work to reinforce that line of thought. But what’s more interesting to us is the fact this Foxbody split in half, curiously in similar fashion to at least two other incidents we can immediately recall "

It really makes us wonder, but since none of us have ever owned one, we want to ask any enthusiasts who know these cars well to reach out and let us know if there is a known issue. After all, seeing any car split in half when it crashes is pretty crazy."
