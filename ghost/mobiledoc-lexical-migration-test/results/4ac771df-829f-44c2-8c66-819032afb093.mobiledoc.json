Both come with a blueprinted LT-1 V8 which has been pretty much gutted and outfitted with an impressive list of internals: computer-balanced race-quality rotating assembly, including forged 4340 steel crankshaft and H-beam steel rods, and forged aluminum pistons. Add to that CNC ported high-flow LT-4 cylinder heads and a nice forced feeding through a custom supercharger with a dedicated belt drive system along with an upgraded fuel delivery system to keep up with that huge influx of oxygen, and you have something quite potent."

SVE says it’s only making 50 each of the Stage 1 and Stage II Camaros for 2023. Like a lot of fine things, these are only coming in a small batch so you need to act fast to grab one before they’re all gone. No doubt the secondary market on these cars is going to involve dramatically inflated prices, but we guess if spanking Demons with a Chevy is what you really want and you have that kind of cash, maybe you’ll be fine with grabbing one later."
