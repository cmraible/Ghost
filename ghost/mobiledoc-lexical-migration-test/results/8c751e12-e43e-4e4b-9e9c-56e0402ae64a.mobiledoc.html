<p>As we announced last week, tonight at 8pm ET (5pm PT), we will be joined by Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney to discuss his new two-part HBO documentary series <em>The Crime of the Century</em>, which details the political operatives and corporations behind the U.S. opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>Note: We will not be watching the documentary during the live chat — we will be discussing it. <a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-crime-of-the-century">Click here</a> for details on how to watch the two-part documentary. If you cannot stream the movie, we'd still like you to participate — so for some background, read some detailed reporting on the opioid crisis in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/investigations/dea-drug-industry-congress/"><strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-sackler-familys-plan-to-keep-its-billions"><strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/opioid-billionaires"><strong><em>ProPublica</em></strong></a>, or in the new book <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612861/empire-of-pain-by-patrick-radden-keefe/"><strong>Empire Of Pain</strong></a>.</em></p>
