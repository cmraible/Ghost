<hr>
<p>During the 80s and 90s Hulk Hogan absolutely ruled <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/vince-mcmahons-car-collection/">professional wrestling</a>. His likeness was everywhere and it seemed like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">just about everyone was a fan</a>. Then in the early part of this century the guy had a resurgence thanks to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-kings-restores-lil-red-wrecker/">reality TV</a>. With all that fame for all those years came piles and piles of cash. But, as they say, mo’ money mo’ problems and Hogan found himself in a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ewan-mcgregor-car-collection/">tumultuous divorce</a> recently. Now the former wrestler is reemerging here and there, even giving a glimpse of his current car collection.</p>

<p>Hogan is obviously a big fan of American muscle cars, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/farm-classic-mopar-muscle-cars/">particularly Mopars</a>. Among his collection is a 1969 Plymouth Road Runner that’s red with black stripes, which we get to see in the video. He also has a black ’69 Road Runner which isn’t in the video. The man is also fortunate enough to own a Dodge Demon, the most powerful production Mopar ever, which he has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/worst-diy-car-modifications/">reportedly modified</a>.</p>
<p>In the video we see a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T. Famous for always modifying his cars, he shows off some of the personal touches on this classic, namely a power switch behind the driver’s side headlight. He’s obviously concerned about the battery going dead, because he also has the car on a trickle charger.</p>
<p>We also get to see Hogan’s black Chevy Caprice with beautiful red pinstriping. Of course, the most exciting car featured in the video is a 1971 Plymouth Hemi ‘Cuda with that massive 426 and shaker hood. It’s also painted Plum Crazy, the paint color people go… crazy over.</p>
<p>We have zero doubts Hogan has more cars than are shown in this video and there are reports which claim that’s absolutely the case. However, reports indicate he lost quite a few during the divorce and the division of assets. Among those losses was his Rolls-Royce, Hummers, and 1952 Ford F1 truck.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the video and hear that Charger start up, but put on headphones first if you’re near other people because it’s pretty loud.</p>
