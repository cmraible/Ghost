<p><em>Well, here's a thing. This post was going to be the end section of this morning's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/01/engaged-reading-digest-whatsapp-tiktok-wef-community/">Engaged Reading Digest</a> - but I send that out as an email, and the embedded post below just did not work with that. At all. </em></p>
<p><em>So, I'm spinning the idea off into its own series of posts ‚Äî but they'll be web-only. (At least, until the Ghost team tweak the send-by-email templates to make embeds work better.)</em></p>

<p>Eight years ago (eight!) I nearly ended up working as part of this team at the World Economic Forum. In retrospect I'm glad I didn't, but looking at what they've achieved over that period ¬†is quite something.</p>
<p>A decade (or more) ago, people were talking about the idea of brands as media creators in their own right. Very, very few organisations have actually delivered on that promise ‚Äî and some who had done so have retreated to more traditional marketing. But the WEF has continued to push forward with that vision. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6618233699966214144" height="293" width="504" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen title="Embedded post"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>In particular, some of my former students ‚Äî <a href="https://twitter.com/djknowles22">David Knowles</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotteAGB?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Charlotte Beale</a> ‚Äî have given the WEF incredible reach via social videos, delivery punchy, compelling <em>and</em> informative material week after week. </p>

<p>One of the really odd things about jorunalism's reponse to the growing attention crisis is that we are just producing ever more content ‚Äî adding to it. Ben's found some good evidence that there are other approaches that work.</p>
