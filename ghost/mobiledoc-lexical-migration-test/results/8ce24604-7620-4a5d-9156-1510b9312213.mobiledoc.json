Under the hood is the coveted fuel injected 5.0-liter V8 paired to an automatic transmission. This car was ordered with some of Ford's best options for the model year, including power steering, power brakes, power windows, and power locks. It also has air conditioning and a tachometer as well. While details are not super clear from the ad, this car does appear to have an upgraded Alpine sound system complete with a remote control and an amplifier in the trunk."
