<p>Good things are happening! Essential workers are going on strike for safer working conditions, both for themselves and the people they care for. The climate movement is taking to the streets ahead of spring state legislative sessions. Biden is making small but legitimate climate moves. And a court ruling in Ohio is once again a reminder that elections, even the obscure ones, matter.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Worker Militancy: </strong><em>The workers keeping the country running are demanding much-needed change. In Chicago, teachers walked out over eminently <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/chicago-teachers-union-lockout-covid-lori-lightfoot"><em>reasonable demands</em></a> regarding school safety. They <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2022/1/12/22880867/chicago-teachers-union-ctu-cps-public-schools-deal-contract-covid-safety-lori-lightfoot-vote"><em>reached a deal</em></a> with the mayor to end the walkout, but on Friday, Chicago <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/cps-students-plan-district-wide-walkout-friday-to-protest-return-to-classrooms/2728327/"><em>students</em></a> walked out to demand better safety protocols. And in Colorado, thousands of Kroger’s workers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/kroger-workers-strike-over-wages"><em>went on strike</em></a> over stalled contract negotiations, as a <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2022/01/report-survey-kroger-wages-grocery-store-workers-covid-working-conditions"><em>new report</em></a> found that as many as 14 percent of Kroger’s workers have been homeless in the past year. National Nurses United, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.axios.com/nurses-united-states-protesting-coronavirus-4f55d01c-94eb-457e-869e-850e84d5d011.html"><em>organized strikes</em></a> across the country this week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-13/us-nurses-strike-to-highlight-working-conditions-during-covid-as-omicron-surges"><em>to demand</em></a> investments in hospitals and better public health leadership from Biden. Nurses in Massachusetts <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164950/st-vincent-hospital-nurses-strike"><em>just won</em></a> better wages and safe staffing after a 10-month strike. And the Starbucks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/business/economy/starbucks-union.html"><em>organizing wave</em></a> continues across the country, <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/washington-employees-union-buffalo-howard-schultz"><em>including in Seattle</em></a>, where the company was founded. You can support these efforts: Municipal workers in Portland are preparing to strike, and are <a href="https://twitter.com/JonahFurman/status/1480718919874797569?s=20"><em>asking for donations</em></a> to their strike fund.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Climate Movement Takes On States, In The Streets: </strong><em>In New York, hundreds of <a href="https://twitter.com/SusanLKang/status/1481682914828070917?s=20"><em>ecosocialists</em></a><a href="https://twitter.com/TheIndypendent/status/1481740430219919365?s=20"><em>marched</em></a> to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office on Thursday to demand <a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-york-s-public-power-bill-could-be-a-model-for-the-r-1846874758"><em>publicly-owned renewable energy</em></a> in the state budget.

And in Colorado, organizers <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/01/13/jared-polis-state-of-the-state-climate-protest/"><em>held a rally</em></a><a href="https://twitter.com/dcwoodruff/status/1481687416956145664?s=20"><em>on the</em></a><a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1481776557660143617?s=20"><em>steps</em></a> of the state capitol <a href="https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2022/01/in-aftermath-of-marshall-fire-climate-activists-join-forces-to-rally-for-change/42414/"><em>to demand</em></a> Gov. Jared Polis declare a climate emergency and commit to phasing out fossil fuel production by 2030 ahead of the state legislative session. And climate change has <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/06/science/candidates-mass-governors-race-are-running-climate/"><em>become a central issue</em></a> in the Massachusetts governor’s race, thanks to constituent pressure.</em></p>
<p><strong>Biden Flexes His Muscle (A Tiny Bit) On Climate: </strong><em>In Biden’s first year in office, carbon emissions rose and fossil fuel production increased. But this week, he made a few good climate moves. Biden <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-nominates-climate-champ-as-feds-bank-cop/"><em>nominated climate hawk Sarah Bloom Raskin</em></a> to serve as the top bank regulator at the Federal Reserve. The Department of Energy announced a sweeping plan to use funds from the infrastructure bill <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/12/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-races-to-deploy-clean-energy-that-creates-jobs-and-lowers-costs/"><em>to build transmission lines</em></a>, a step towards transitioning to renewable energy. As part of that plan, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/13/energy-department-announce-clean-energy-corps-hire-1000-staffers-work-climate-change/"><em>the department is hiring</em></a> 1,000 new employees — its biggest hiring spree in decades. It also announced an offshore wind auction <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/offshore-wind-auction-could-yield-power-2-million-homes-and-new-industries-ny-and-nj"><em>that could power</em></a> two million homes in New York and New Jersey.

<p><strong>Local Elections Matter: </strong><em>The Ohio Supreme Court <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/12/redistricting-ohio-supreme-court-rejects-state-house-and-senate-maps/6447740001/"><em>rejected redistricting maps</em></a> that heavily suppressed Democratic votes. Ohio voters had passed constitutional amendments in recent years to require fairer redistricting, and Democrats <a href="https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/1481363116650868736?s=20"><em>won a slate</em></a> of judge elections in the past two cycles that laid the groundwork for the ruling.</em></p>
<p><strong>It’s Primary Season: </strong><em>Meanwhile, the 2022 primaries are heating up. A former Iowa congresswoman is challenging Sen.

Beto O’Rourke is <a href="https://www.thenation.com/podcast/politics/beto-orourke-texas/"><em>once again trying</em></a> to organize Texas Democrats, this time to win the governorship.
