<p>Not only is it a cute little classic, but it is multipurpose. This classic car is powered by a 1,447cc Inline 4-cylinder engine rated at 38.3-bhp and is connected to a four-speed manual transmission. The same engine powers a pair of reversible propellers that can be seen on the rear of the car.</p>
<p>According to the listing, this amphibious car has just shy of 10,000 miles on the clock. The exterior is painted in a crisp white and is complemented by a contrasting red exterior with red accents on the exterior of the vehicle. The sale of the car comes with the original spare tire, a jack, and a tool kit.</p>

<p>Designed by Hans Trippel, the car was first introduced at the 1961 New York Auto Show and was produced in West Germany.  A successor of the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen used during the Second World War, just 3,878 of these amphibious Model 770s were produced during its single-generation run from 1961-1968.  The name Amphicar comes from blending both “amphibious” and “car”.</p>
<p>While it was modest in performance with boats and cars alike, it's not a common sight to see a vehicle that can navigate both land and sea. Legal all around, it was given all the navigation lights required by the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Not only is this car cool in its own right, it is a conversation starter at any car show or event. If this is up your alley, err canal, then contact Ideal Classic Cars today to get behind the wheel.</p>
