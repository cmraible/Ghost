<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The big day is finally here — we have officially changed our name from <em>The Daily Poster </em>to <em>The Lever</em>, and we have launched our brand-new expanded website at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">LeverNews.com</a>. Go check it out (and please mark this email from <a href="mailto:editor@levernews.com">editor@levernews.com</a> as “not spam” in your email system).</p>
<p><strong>REMINDER: You don’t have to do anything or take any action — nothing changes about your subscriber status. You will still get our daily reporting in your inbox (albeit under a new name), and as a supporting subscriber, you will still have all the same exclusive privileges. You can access your subscriber account </strong><a href="https://levernews.com/account/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>, and if you have any questions, please send them to </strong><a href="mailto:support@levernews.com"><strong>support@levernews.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Watch our new video about our expansion (and subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3bHsedO3Es_56I5E8r4XFA">our new YouTube channel</a> while you’re at it):</p>

<p>Also, please share the video on social media!</p>
<p>As part of our expansion, we are launching a new monthly virtual happy hour exclusively for our supporting subscribers. You will get to converse with and interrogate our staff —<strong></strong>and yell at me.</p>
<p>Our first happy hour will be <strong><a href="__GHOST_URL__/live-chat-our-new-monthly-happy-hour-2/">this Thursday 3/24 at 7 pm ET (4 pm PT)</a></strong>. You’ll chat with <em>The Lever</em>’s reporters and editors about our expansion, we’ll get your input on our future coverage, and I’ll give you my fish-out-of-water take on what it’s like to be in Los Angeles right now in the lead-up to this weekend’s Academy Awards.</p>

<p><em>The Lever’s</em> mission is straightforward:</p>
<p>We believe a functioning democracy requires a vibrant independent media and aggressive reporting, rather than corporate media promoting propaganda.</p>
<p>We believe fearless subscriber-supported journalism can create leverage that forces politicians and corporations to fulfill their promises.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Archimedes: We believe that with a strong enough lever, we can help move the world.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the team that is making this expansion possible. We absolutely could not do this without you. Together, we are building a new kind of media outlet — one that is supported by readers and focused on holding the powerful accountable.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more news on this expansion in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
