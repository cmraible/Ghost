The PBM will then figure out which drug company is willing to offer the insurer the biggest discount on the drug. PBMs get paid based on the discount they negotiate. The arrangement encourages profit-hungry drug manufacturers to jack up insulin prices before negotiating discounts, while PBMs are incentivized to discourage insurers from covering cheaper drugs, since they won’t score as much profit from the smaller rebates they’ll net from these medications."
