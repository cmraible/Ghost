The accident in question didn’t take place in the middle of the night on a deserted rural road, but instead went down at about 2 pm on Saturday January 7 on Northwest Loop 410 near I-10 West. That’s right, they were doing it in Texas."

After all, they’re already built for higher speeds than surface streets, so you don’t have to deal with the dangers of cross-streets and intersections. They also tend to have nice straightaways and gentler curves, plus at least in some cases the road surface is smoother. Still, the freeway is no racetrack."

Really, that’s best done on a drag strip, not public roads, otherwise you might be dealing with this kind of situation, or worse."
