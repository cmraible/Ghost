<hr>
<p>A man in Monroe County, Georgia says he got his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-stolen-broad-daylight/">stolen</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chrysler-300-has-a-demon-heart/">Chrysler 300</a> back using a pair of pliers. It would seem logical that the man might have used the pliers to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-steal-chevy-camaro/">break into</a> his own car, but that’s not even close to what went down. Instead, the man tricked the alleged thief by pretending the pliers <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/machine-gun-kelly-stolen/">were a gun</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn how thieves are stealing Dodges directly from the factory right <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-durango-hellcats/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The owner of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chrysler-300-hellcat-punch/">Chrysler 300</a> says he spotted the car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/revisiting-kid-neighbors-driveway/">parked in a driveway</a> on the morning of March 16. Someone was sitting behind the wheel, but he couldn’t see who it was. When he stopped and approached the car, the driver tried to leave and that’s when the man pulled out a pair of pliers, holding them as if they were a gun.</p>
<p>In a move which would surprise nobody reasonable, the driver just drove away, perhaps because they’ve seen a gun before. Pulling something like that is a good way to get shot, so we really don’t recommend it.</p>
<p>However, the story gets weirder from there. When the owner of the Chrysler 300 called the sheriff’s office and a deputy was sent out, the man said he though his estranged wife had taken the car but couldn’t be sure. He claimed she hadn’t been answering his calls and had a meth addiction problem, plus they got into a fight the previous night.</p>
<p>The deputy then got into contact with the wife, who claimed her husband tried blocking the road so she couldn’t leave, then pulled a real gun on her. Because of his actions, she said she was in the process of getting a restraining order against him.</p>
<p>What’s real and what’s a lie in the situation? Who knows? But it does sound like the Chrysler 300 wasn’t actually stolen, so the couple will need to sort out ownership of that and more.</p>
