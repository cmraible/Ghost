<hr>
<p>If you're anything like us, you grew up playing with Tonka <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/the-coolest-off-roaders-on-motorious/">trucks</a> in the yard. Remember those? They were big, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1957-chevy-210-modified-nostalgia/">yellow</a>, and made out of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-hot-rod-stretches-legs/">good old fashioned steel</a>.</p>
<p>While browsing YouTube, we stumbled upon this video from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzhFNSV-OuHQiYpwDMImsw">Rescue & Restore</a> channel. In the video, the host restores a rusty Tonka dump truck from 1980.</p>

<p>He's got a long road ahead of him. It's clear that this truck spent an awful lot of time outside. In fact, the rust isn't even the biggest problem – there's a bullet hole in the dump bed!</p>
<p>What's entertaining about this toy restoration is how similar some parts of it feel to full-size auto restoration. That's because these trucks are made out of steel, so many metalworking techniques carry over.</p>
<p>After disassembling the truck, he carefully repairs the bullet hole with a welder before taking all of the truck's metal parts into the sandblaster. Watching the sandblaster strip away all of the old paint and rust is quite satisfying indeed.</p>

<p>Next, he powdercoats the metal parts with primer, then sands it smooth. Finally, it's time for the bright yellow color coat (black on the chassis).</p>
<p>He also cleans up the plastic parts, and he even polished the tires back to a nice shine. One of our favorite details is the white-letter tires – you'll have to watch the video to pick up on his technique. It's pretty clever.</p>

<p>As the truck is carefully re-assembled with rivets, we're impressed by how few parts required replacement. The windows are new, and new axles were cut and polished. Besides that, all of the parts are original. </p>
<p>It was a lot of work, but this truck cleaned up nice! Of course, the final step in the restoration was a fresh pair of bright red "Tonka" decals. We may have our hands full with car projects, but this video makes us hope we find a classic Tonka truck in a barn somewhere.</p>
