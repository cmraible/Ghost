After a terrible incident occurred where his whole family was slaughtered by a demon while he was out selling coal in town, upon returning, he finds his family slain and his younger sister has been turned into a demon with a lust for blood. The game follows our hero as he trains with his master and defends his sister from other slayers confused over her demonic appearance. He then goes through a test of survival called the Final Selection where he must survive for seven days within a dark forest killing demons and not being turned himself. Tanjro will meet up with a cast of friendly demon slayers as well as a cast of dark and mysterious demons, all while trying to overcome the hurdles in his way to becoming the ultimate demon slayer."

As you progress through the eight chapters, you’ll be delighted to see that the game plays out in a very similar fashion to the anime, with some great in-game conversations between slayers and demons. This can be rather amusing at times, and dark the next. Exploring segments allows you to move around a few small environments, seeking out collectibles in the form of fragments of memory which allow you to see more of the story, flesh out the characters motivations and even fill in some of the characters backstories."

Playing as a Slayer allows you to swap between two characters or use one of them as an assist attack, giving you a chance to increase your combo. You can only play as a Demon solo, which means you won't be allowed a teammate but you’ll have a special demon art available that can greatly increase your power and allow you to pull off some very cool attacks; it's an interesting mechanic, to say the least. Finally, you have archives to view unlockables and a training mode that allows you to learn from the best fighters in the game; the more you fight these fighters, they become increasingly harder but defeating them will allow you to unlock additional rewards, points so you can spend them later on in the rewards mode.
