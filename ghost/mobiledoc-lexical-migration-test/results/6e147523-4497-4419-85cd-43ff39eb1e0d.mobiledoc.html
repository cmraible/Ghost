<p>Ford really wants everyone to love the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/crashed-mustang-mach-e/">Mustang Mach-E</a>, even though many fans are determined to hate it. After pouring a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mid-engine-ford-mustang-gt/">tremendous amount of resources</a> into creating the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/all-electric-dodge-charger/">all-electric SUV</a>, the Blue Oval is on a marketing blitz to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-mustang-57th-anniversary/">win over fans</a>. This includes having one pace at Talladega Superspeedway last Sunday for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-legal-nascar-racer/">NASCAR Cup Series</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Someone already crashed a Ford Mustang Mach-E. See the horrific aftermath <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/crashed-mustang-mach-e/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Despite plenty of heckling from naysayers online, the Mach-E didn’t run out of charge as it performed its duties on the track. Instead, the EV performed just as it should. In all fairness, pacing a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/banned-1969-dodge-daytona/">NASCAR</a> Cup Series race isn’t exactly taxing on a vehicle. Instead, it’s a great way to raise awareness of a new model, which is exactly why Ford wanted it there.</p>
<p>The race was a good one for Ford since Team Penske’s Brad Keselowski was able to clench the No. 1 spot in overtime behind the wheel of his No. 2 Ford Mustang. That puts Keselowski at six all-time wins at Talladega, tying him with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/legendary-jeff-gordan-car/">Jeff Gordon</a> and Dale Earnhardt Jr. at second place for that distinct accomplishment.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future NASCAR will launch an all-electric SUV series and the Ford Mustang Mach-E can really show off its performance chops. However, the Jaguar I-Pace and Tesla Model X are about the only true competition it enjoys at the moment, so that might not be as exciting of a prospect as some might think.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time an all-electric vehicle has paced a NASCAR Cup Series race. In fact, it’s the second Ford EV to perform the task. Back in 2012 Ford made waves when it used an all-electric Focus as the pace car at Richmond Raceway.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muofQglatRo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
