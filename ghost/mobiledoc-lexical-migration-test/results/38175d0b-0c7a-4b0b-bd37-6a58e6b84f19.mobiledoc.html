<p>The Toyota Supra might be all the rage these days when it comes to Japanese sports cars, but the Nissan Z car is still one of the most fun-to-drive cars of its era. If you're looking for a bargain of a 1980s sports car, look no further than this <a href="https://www.flemingsultimategarage.com/vehicles/3260/1986-nissan-300zx?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1986 Nissan 300ZX</a> that might be the ultimate all-original survivor having had just one owner who never modified the car and kept the miles extremely low!</p>

<p>Although the 1986 Nissan 300ZX was available as a 2+2, this car is more of a proper sports car with seating for just two. Everything about this Light Pewter Metallic 300ZX looks to be right out of the '80s from its original wheels to the lack of wear on the corduroy-looking seats. There's a reason for the incredible condition as the odometer shows less than 48,000 miles, and the car still has its original engine and transmission. When it is time to take the t-tops off (and who wouldn't want to?), the original bags are there in the trunk to keep the glass panels safe, and this car even comes with the original Monroney sticker and owner's manual.</p>
<p>Nissan had some big shoes to fill when it replaced the 280Z, and when the 300ZX arrived in 1984, it was a fun little two-seater that existed in a pre-Miata era of cars like the Pontiac Fiero and Honda CRX. Under the hood of this car is the naturally aspirated 3.0-liter V-6 that produces 160 horsepower, which isn't that far off of what a Camaro IROC-Z and Â Mustang GT put out back in 1986. This engine is mated to a four-speed automatic, and while it's not the high-powered 300ZX Turbo with a manual gearbox, this car is still going to be a fun cruiser.</p>
