<p>A Charlotte, NC collector found the solid original Shelby in a high performance Ford collection not far from his home in 2010. He then selected Concord, NC restorer and Mustang expert, the late Monroe Withers, to restore his prized Shelby GT-350. The ultra-high-quality highly detailed restoration, according to the owner, "took three years and one day." There have only been 116 miles put on this piece of automotive history since the restoration. According to the owner, "as well as I remember the engine was rebuilt by a local race engine builder, and is very peppy".  He also maintains that this Shelby is one of the tightest and best driving of the many Fords that he has had restored. It is resplendent in the original color of Grabber Blue with white Clarion Knit bucket seat interior. </p>

<p>Except for an older show quality repaint in the original color of Matador Red, this gorgeous <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-oldsmobile-442-w-30/">1970 Oldsmobile 442 </a>is all original and has only covered 14,387 miles since new.  The seller is willing to sign a mileage statement as he got one when he purchased it, but North Carolina DMV does not put miles on titles of antique cars, so it will have to be sold "mileage exempt".  However once you see the exemplary original condition on this muscle car, you will have no doubt about the miles. Absolutely stunning in Matador Red with white bucket seat with console interior, car features the 455 Rocket V-8 with forced air induction which is mated to a 4-Speed manual gearbox.  Car features the luxury of power steering and power brakes. We are told by a previous owner that the car had every emblem and piece of chrome removed prior to the show-quality repaint.</p>
