<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/feds-bust-car-theft-ring/">Federal authorities</a> recently announced they arrested a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/canadian-international-car-theft/">group of thieves</a> who were targeting high-end luxury cars in New York City and the surrounding area. Authorities say they’ve been attempting to track down the thieves, which at certain points involved <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-police-chase/">high-speed chases</a> on highways with the criminals <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">slipping away</a>. But, as they say, the arm of the law is long and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-collector-arrested-vehicles-seized/">they couldn’t get away forever</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Canadian police also busted a luxury car theft ring recently. Check out the details <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/canadian-international-car-theft/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>This group even went so far as to target dealerships in Connecticut, particularly Chrysler dealers. They made off with 2 Dodge Charger Hellcats at one point.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials say back in December when they tried arresting one member of the theft ring, he got away by driving into several FBI cars using a stolen vehicle. When they finally caught up with him, the man was in a New York City apartment with over 30 vehicle key fobs, indicating he and the others were reprogramming vehicles on the spot to accept the new fob, a trick we’ve seen quite a bit lately particularly for luxury car theft. Several license plates, about $89,000 in cash, stolen merchandise, and more were also seized from the apartment.</p>
<p>When the FBI raided an apartment belonging to another member of the car theft ring, one agent was bit by a pit bull. They were able to seize 40 car key fobs, a glass-punch device, and a police radio.</p>
<p>Authorities claim that along with stolen cell phones and entire ATM machines, the gang swiped around $10 million in goods, so taking them down was a huge accomplishment. Amazingly, it seems only 4 men pulled off all these heists. All of them are in their 20s and are now facing several serious charges, so the legal battle will begin soon.</p>
<p>In total, federal authorities believe the 4 men pulled off over 130 individual burglaries. Getting these guys off the street will hopefully make a big impact on crime in the region, especially car theft.</p>
