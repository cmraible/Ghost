To be honest, plenty feel fortunate to have a reproduction version. However, there’s a special class of Porsche enthusiast who lusts after the highly customized Outlaws. They’re in luck, because a <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/mo20/shift-monterey/lots/r0055-1960-porsche-momo-356-rsr-outlaw-by-emory/934111?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1960 Porsche 356 RSR </a>Outlaw Coupe is included in the upcoming RM Sotheby’s Shift/Monterey <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorious-online-car-show-winners-announced/">online</a> event.</p>

<p>Customized through a collaboration of Rod Emory and Momo, this car is actually a Porsche 964 wrapped in aluminum body panels to make it look like a tricked-out <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/mo20/shift-monterey/lots/r0055-1960-porsche-momo-356-rsr-outlaw-by-emory/934111?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Porsche 356</a>. Like a ratrod, not everyone is going to love the look of this car and that’s the point: it appeals to a certain kind of car collector.</p>

<p>With a look as wild as this, this Porsche needs to be pushing some serious performance. Fortunately, it comes with a twin-turbo Emory-Rothsport Outlaw-4 engine churning out 394-horsepower – more than enough to get this car scooting in a hurry. Plus you get a nice view of those twin snails exposed in the rear, so the cars you’re gapping have something neat to stare at.</p>

<p>Thanks to Momo, the stripped-down interior which features a full roll cage and other motorsports-inspired features should be surprisingly comfortable. There’s a nice Protipo steering wheel, racing pedals, racing seats with what appears to be a fair amount of padding, and safety harnesses for good measure. Plus, the shifter knob is made of polished wood, and that’s a nice touch.</p>
