Some people are very upset that this is not what they wanted, and the core gaming market always shuns any form of casual gaming. Craig in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Attack</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s reaction video exclaimed: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘They’re selling us cardboard?’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, albeit in a joking way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other side to this argument has been users praising Nintendo’s creativity. Parents have been very impressed with Nintendo’s new innovative idea and this is a fantastic project for any parent to share with their children. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Game</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a id=\"amznPsBmLink_9589681\" class=\"amzn_ps_bm_tl\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-LABO-Robot-Kit-Switch/dp/B01N4N8NAL/ref=as_li_bk_tl/?tag=daliuvr-20&amp;linkId=d621bada39e9710d261963129970e014&amp;linkCode=ktl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-amzn-ps-bm-keyword=\"Nintendo Labo\" data-amzn-link-id=\"d621bada39e9710d261963129970e014\">Nintendo Labo</a><img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"amznPsBmPixel_9589681\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; width: 0px !important;\" src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&amp;t=daliuvr-20&amp;bm-id=default&amp;l=ktl&amp;linkId=d621bada39e9710d261963129970e014&amp;_cb=1516255323888\" alt=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" border=\"0\" /> is the first game to utilize the IR sensor on the bottom of the right joy con.

Nintendo were, and still are, first and foremost, a toy company. Throughout their 131 year history, they have ventured into many different business opportunities. When the company was formed all the way back in 1889, they manufactured hanafuda playing cards, and found lucrative success in casinos around Japan. They operated out of a tiny building in Kyoto Japan, just a 20 minute walk away from their current headquarters.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1202 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building.jpg?resize=400%2C727\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"727\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building.jpg?w=528&amp;ssl=1 528w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building.jpg?resize=165%2C300&amp;ssl=1 165w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building.jpg?resize=300%2C545&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1200 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-1.jpg?resize=400%2C727\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"727\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-1.jpg?w=528&amp;ssl=1 528w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-1.jpg?resize=165%2C300&amp;ssl=1 165w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-1.jpg?resize=300%2C545&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1201 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-2.jpg?resize=400%2C727\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"727\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-2.jpg?w=528&amp;ssl=1 528w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-2.jpg?resize=165%2C300&amp;ssl=1 165w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendos-first-building-2.jpg?resize=300%2C545&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I actually took these photos myself on my trip to Japan two years ago and I was shocked as to how small Nintendo’s first building was!)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo later moved on to the toy industry in the mid 20th century with the Nintendo Ultra hand in 1966.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1205\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendo-toys.jpeg?resize=447%2C679\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendo-toys.jpeg?w=447&amp;ssl=1 447w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendo-toys.jpeg?resize=197%2C300&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nintendo-toys.jpeg?resize=300%2C456&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And three years later, they released the Nintendo Love Tester&#8230;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1206\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nitnendo-toys.png?resize=421%2C613\" alt=\"\" width=\"421\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nitnendo-toys.png?w=421&amp;ssl=1 421w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nitnendo-toys.png?resize=206%2C300&amp;ssl=1 206w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nitnendo-toys.png?resize=300%2C437&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They even had love hotels at one stage… Nintendo has a dark past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically what I am trying to say here is that Nintendo has always been about trying new and different things that people wouldn’t usually expect from them. Today, we predominately know Nintendo as the video game company that makes Mario and Legend of Zelda games, but they have always been a company to stretch the limits of our imaginations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a 23 year old with no children and none on the horizon, this personally is not a day one purchase for me. But after watching the trailer and seeing everything that this game has to offer, I can acknowledge that this new idea from Nintendo is a perfect activity for kids to construct and play games with their parents. That is the audience that this new game is aimed at.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">… and try not to stress, I’m sure the announcements for Super Smash Bros., Animal Crossing, Virtual Console and Nintendo’s new online service aren’t too far away. Let’s just be patient and give Nintendo Labo the moment in the spotlight that it deserves.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more recap articles and interesting new posts about Nintendo and the Switch, <a href=\"http://facebook.com/switchaboo\">click here</a> and consider liking and following us on Facebook.</p>\n"
