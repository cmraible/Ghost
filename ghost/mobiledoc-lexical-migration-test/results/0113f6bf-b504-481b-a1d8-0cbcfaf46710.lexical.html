<p>If you’ve ever been in a bad <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/tips/auto-accident/">car accident</a> where frame damage is involved, you know that virtually guarantees the car will be totaled. Thanks to many, many botched <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-is-what-a-cheap-lamborghini-costs-to-fix/">repair jobs</a>, many people believe frame damage isn’t <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-buys-maserati-quattroporte-salvage-title-at-auction/">something that can be fixed</a>. That’s actually debatable, especially after you watch vTuned Garage fix this wrecked 2003 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/own-a-fiery-2002-porsche-911-turbo/">Porsche 911</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to see that the front-end damage isn’t just cosmetic on this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-the-official-porsche-birthday-party-unfold/">Porsche</a>. You can spot some obvious frame damage, but assessing just how bad it is requires taking off pretty much everything from the front end. Considering a lot of the parts are already damaged they had to go anyway.</p>
<p>With all that crap off the Porsche you get to see this guy start going to work on figuring out just how bad the frame damage is. Then he proceeds to fix the car using a process you might find interesting. You’ll note he doesn’t use any protective equipment like gloves or eye wear while operating a reciprocating saw to cut through metal and possibly while using a grinder, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-1953-chevy-corvettes-being-built-by-hand/">something we definitely don’t advocate</a>. Later in the video they’re using gloves, goggles, and a mask, so obviously they use protective gear sometimes.</p>

<p>Cars with frame damage that haven’t been fixed correctly aren’t fun to drive, since they can shake at freeway speeds. They also tend to wear tires unevenly. That’s not only expensive but potentially dangerous. It’s obvious not everyone has this guy’s skills and experience, or maybe some people don’t want to put as much effort into fixing a Chevy Cruze versus a Porsche 911.</p>
<p>Purist Porsche fans of course will say putting so much work into a 996 isn’t worth it, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">but they’re just haters</a>. Obviously, there’s value in this car or the shop would’ve just stripped off parts and sent it to be recycled.</p>
