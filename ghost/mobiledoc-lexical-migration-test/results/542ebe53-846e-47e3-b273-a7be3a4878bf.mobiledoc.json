We’ve seen this kind of scene play out over and over across the country, including in the Motor City before. And while this is a victory, it’s also a reminder that car thieves are working overtime these days to steal and hack apart your ride to enrich themselves."

Sadly, that’s not a completely uncommon thing in Detroit, but these people were smart enough to try doing something about it. Thankfully, police didn’t just blow off the complaints but instead started investigating, a move which paid off in spades."

For many, walking out of their house in the morning to find their ride is gone is absolutely devastating. It’s great to see some justice served, even though this bust only led to the arrest of one person. And it’s likely that person is already out on bail."

Usually that’s a big part of these chop shop busts, along with the vehicles which are still whole. Not surprisingly, there were a number of Mopars in the shots of the property, along with several other brands, including some vehicles you might think thieves wouldn’t even bother stealing."
