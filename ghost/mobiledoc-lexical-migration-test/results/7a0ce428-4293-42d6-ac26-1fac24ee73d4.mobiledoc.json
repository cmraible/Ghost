The Game narrates in the video, saying Hart wants to trade his ride for a Lamborghini sitting in the driveway. Obviously, it’s a joke between neighbors, but it got us thinking: should Kevin Hart be allowed to touch another high-powered, high-performance car?"

In other words, Hart could find the one he likes the best, both for looks and performance. And by driving a Mustang, everyone would be fully warned of the danger they’re in being anywhere nearby, so it’s really a win-win."

With a maximum 205-hp on tap through the little boxer engine, it’s difficult to get into too much trouble with this car. At the same time, it handles extremely well, so he can have some fun on all those Mulholland Highway twists and turns."
