<p>One of our automotive "guilty pleasures" is the 1977 to 1981 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/restomod-chevy-camaro-lsx/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> Z28. What these cars lacked in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/900-horsepower-ford-sierra-drags-britain/">performance</a>, they most certainly made up for it in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/pumpkin-painted-cars-halloween/">attitude</a>.</p>
<p>The aggressive, hawk-like beak nose was accentuated by a deep airdam, a rear spoiler, and prominent fender flares. In addition, attractive gradient stripes on the side featured large Z28 callouts, while a similar motif drew attention to the hood scoop.</p>

<p>For the most part, these cars were sheep in wolves' clothing. It's not GM's fault though, really – the one-two punch of a fuel crisis and new federal emissions standards really knocked the wind out of a lot of performance cars. The Camaro Z28 was no exception.</p>
<p>However, someone decided that enough was enough – they were going to do something about it. They were going to give the late second-gen Z28 the performance it deserved.</p>

<p>The previous owner of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213995/1978-chevrolet-camaro-z-28">this beautiful white 1978 Camaro Z28</a> stuffed a worked-over 427 cubic inch V8 under the aftermarket cowl hood. We dig the era-correct Moroso valve covers.</p>
<p>Power is nothing without control. You'll find power front disc brakes and power steering to help reign in that big block, as well as subframe connectors to keep everything square. </p>

<p>This Z28 is looking its best thanks to a set of 17" American Racing Torq Thrust wheels and a mildly lowered stance. Combined with the red and orange stripes, this is one of the cleanest lookin second gen Z28s we've ever seen.</p>
<p>We found this awesome Camaro right here on Motorious, as the ominously named <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213995/1978-chevrolet-camaro-z-28">Showdown Motors</a> in Fraser, Michigan. If you want to experience a '77-'81 Z28 with some real power, be prepared to part with $28,900 – and hold on tight.</p>
