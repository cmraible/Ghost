This 'Cuda rolled off the assembly line in May 1970, and it was sold just a month later to a West Virginia man who modified the car for the strip while retaining all of the original parts to turn it back to stock. Sadly, the drag-racing owner passed away less than a year later having put about 30 quarter-mile runs on the car, and it sat until 1977 with just 42 actual miles. The subsequent owner returned the car to stock and drove it just one mile in his 16 years of ownership, and over the next several owners, the mileage crept slowly to 81 miles in 2015. Since then, it's been driven just five miles in as many years!"
