<p>The <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/consignments/?auction_filter=OKC19&qry=&year_filter=&make_filter=&model_filter=&run_day_filter=&sort_by=&pagenumber=1" rel="noopener">Leake Oklahoma City auction</a> in America is shaping up to be quite the show, with a broad variety of classic and collector cars to go under the hammer on February 23, 2019. However, we all love a good deal, and the news that Leake will include 114 lots to be sold without reserve offers the potential for a bargain.</p>
<p>If you’re in the market for a C3 Corvette Stingray, you’re spoilt for choice with many of these American icons up from grabs at the auction. However, two Stingrays really stood out to us in the form of lot 625 and 129, both without reserve.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/34054/1982-Chevrolet-Corvette/" rel="noopener">Lot 625</a> is a limited edition model dubbed ‘Collectors Edition’ and served to mark the end of the C3 production. 6,759 of these Corvettes were but and are distinguished by their almost golden color, unique trim, and badging. When new, this Stingray was the first Corvette to exceed $20,000 back in the early 1980s. This highly original and unrestored example has covered less than 50K miles with its numbers matching 5.7-liter V8 engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/34075/1978-Chevrolet-Corvette/" rel="noopener">Lot 129</a> is another special edition mode, this time celebrating the 25th anniversary of Corvette. In 1978 a Stingray was used as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-pace-cars/">official pace car</a> of the Indianapolis 500, with a run of Pace Car special editions being made available to the public. Every car got matching two-tone paint, unique spoilers, red-stripe wheels, and sport seats.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/33994/1958-Chevrolet-Rat-Rod/" rel="noopener">rat rod</a> is another intriguing lot being sold without reserve. Based on a 1958 Chevrolet truck, its distressed external looks hide a recently rebuilt 350 cubic-inch V8 engine under the hood. However, the real surprise is found inside the cabin, or should we say cockpit, complete with seats from an airliner, the interior has been turned into a flight deck. 18 aircraft gauges, 15 toggle switches, and an aero-style steering wheel makes for a totally unique vehicle.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some old-school American muscle, check out this handsome orange 1974 <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/33899/1974-Dodge-Challenger/" rel="noopener">Dodge Challenger</a>. Under the hood is a 440 cubic-inch big block V8 engine equipped with a four-barrel carburetor. Benefiting from a restoration, this Dodge appears a great example of the iconic Challenger.</p>

<p>However, we think the star of the cars being auctioned without reserve is a <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/34070/1981-DeLorean-DMC/&#93" rel="noopener">1981 DeLorean DMC 12</a>. This numbers matching machine is great example of the 80s sports car that captured the imagination of a generation. Sporting its iconic naked aluminum body, and those ever-cool gullwing doors, it’s just waiting for someone to live their <em>Back to the Future</em> fantasies.</p>
<p>With over 400 vehicles heading to the auctions block, it’s well worth checking out <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/consignments/?auction_filter=OKC19&qry=&year_filter=&make_filter=&model_filter=&run_day_filter=&sort_by=&pagenumber=1" rel="noopener">Leake’s Oklahoma City</a> catalog and maybe bagging a bargain fo your own on February 23rd.</p>
