<p>Good things are happening! In the United Kingdom, tens of thousands of workers are striking for better wages and working conditions, as heatwaves and inflation impose ever more challenges. Their efforts come as workers in the United States continue to unionize in <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/first-three-quarters-union-election-petitions-up-56-exceeding-all-fy21">surging numbers</a>, marking an immense escalation of labor activism and mass action, and reminding us all that it is people power that can and will improve daily life for everyone. On another front, the American Federation of Teachers, comprised of 1.7 million teachers, has called for their pension fund manager to divest from fossil fuels. Also, congressional staffers leap forward with their union drive, and two federal agencies are partnering to deliver a more holistic approach to protecting worker dignity.</p>

<h3 id="monumental-uk-strike-wave">Monumental UK Strike Wave</h3>
<p>The U.K.‚Äôs Communication Workers Union (CWU) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f270c3e2-2731-407e-9ef5-de6a11a085a4">said</a> on Tuesday that more than 115,000 British postal workers have voted to strike to dispute poor working conditions and pay. The strikers join engineers and call center staff at BT Group, the U.K.‚Äôs largest telecom company, who have also voted to strike in response to pay cuts and inflation. BT‚Äôs chief executive, Philip Jansen, enjoyed a 32 percent pay increase in the last year, while frontline worker wages have stagnated.</p>
<p>These strikes will be some of the largest industrial actions of the summer, with more <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8dac1948-dd32-4603-9ec2-eea9b6c5f7c3">unions</a> across the U.K. set to escalate their demands in the weeks to come. The CWU represents workers who maintain essential public services like internet and mail, which have been vital lifelines during the pandemic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is an incredible result that has been achieved despite a real culture of fear imposed by senior BT management,‚Äù <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/30/bt-staff-vote-for-first-national-strike-in-35-years">said</a> Dave Ward, CWU‚Äôs general secretary, of the BT workers‚Äô strike. ‚ÄúThis proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that no worker in the U.K. is unreachable, that all workers are ready to stand up and fight for higher pay and, in some cases, better conditions.‚Äù</p>

<p>Amid efforts to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/congress-staffers-climate-letter-pelosi-schumer/index.html">demand</a> climate action, congressional staffers continue to organize by seeking union elections. The offices of Democratic Reps. Andy Levin (Mich.), Cori Bush (Mo.), Jes√∫s ‚ÄúChuy‚Äù Garc√≠a (Ill.), Ro Khanna (Calif.), Ted Lieu (Calif.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), and Melanie Stansbury (N.M.) filed this week.</p>
<p>Staffers are organizing to contest unlivable wages and vast inequity in their workplace. ‚ÄúFrom Amazon and Starbucks to the halls of Congress to state legislatures across our country, every worker deserves the protected right of freedom of association, joining together with their colleagues in solidarity to organize and bargain collectively for a better workplace,‚Äù said the Congressional Workers Union in a recent <a href="https://www.congressionalworkersunion.org/press-releases/staff-of-eight-house-offices-celebrate-becoming-first-to-unionize">statement</a>.</p>

<p>This Tuesday, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) ‚Äî which represents 1.7 million teachers, nurses, and public workers ‚Äî voted to call on the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), the $1.3 trillion retirement fund manager, to divest from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWith this vote, workers are taking control of their assets,‚Äù said David Hughes, one the co-authors of the<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFT?src=hashtag_click"></a><a href="https://www.aft.org/resolution/divest-fossil-fuels-and-reinvest-workers-and-communities">AFT resolution</a>. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre withdrawing the social license for the likes of ExxonMobil to operate, to destroy our climate and communities.‚Äù Hughes <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/07/19/science/american-federation-teachers-calls-fossil-fuel-divestment/">said</a> he believes that the resolution will help spur other retirement funds nationwide to divest from fossil fuels.</p>
<h3 id="federal-agencies-band-together-for-worker-rights">Federal Agencies Band Together For Worker Rights</h3>
<p>This week, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) forged a new partnership in the form of a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/node-7857/ftcnlrb-mou-71922.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> (MOU). The partnership sets out to ‚Äúbetter root out practices that harm workers in the ‚Äògig economy‚Äô and other labor markets, to enhance the enforcement of federal laws and regulations administered by the agencies, and to promote interagency collaboration through information sharing, cross-agency training, and coordinated outreach.‚Äù</p>
<p>NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/national-labor-relations-board-and-federal-trade-commission-forge-new?fbclid=IwAR2n5Ze4KcmwyrYNgoRnCiXxaGaWxRq7YyXDyQs0qrfhoUs9p34Oi7ZGTo0">stated</a>: ‚ÄúThis MOU is critical to advancing a whole-of-government approach to combating unlawful conduct that harms workers.‚Äù</p>
<p>The NLRB has not had a <a href="https://labornotes.org/2022/07/viewpoint-nlrb-underfunded-and-understaffed">funding increase</a> since 2014, a problem that needs to be addressed in order to support workers‚Äô rights. This agency‚Äôs new partnership with the FTC will help provide important resources and information, as the NLRB waits for much-needed funding.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take some time to read Reginald Shepherd‚Äôs poem about changes, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51769/hesitation-theory">Hesitation Theory</a>‚Äù:</p>
<p><em>I drift into the sound of wind,</em></p>
<p><em>how small my life must be</em></p>
<p><em>to fit into his palm like that, holly</em></p>
<p><em>leaf, bluejay feather, milkweed fluff,</em></p>
<p><em>pin straw or sycamore pod, resembling</em></p>
<p><em>scraps of light. The world</em></p>
<p><em>slips through these fingers</em></p>
<p><em>so easily, there‚Äôs so much</em></p>
<p><em>to miss: the sociable bones</em></p>
<p><em>linked up in supple rows, mineral</em></p>
<p><em>seams just under the skin. I hold</em></p>
<p><em>my palm against the sun and don‚Äôt see</em></p>
<p><em>palm or sun, don‚Äôt hold anything</em></p>
<p><em>in either hand. I look up, look</em></p>
<p><em>away (what‚Äôs that?), I trip</em></p>
<p><em>and stumble (fall</em></p>
<p><em>again), find myself face down</em></p>
<p><em>in duff, a foam of fallen live oak</em></p>
<p><em>leaves, with only</em></p>
<p><em>this life, mine at times.</em></p>
