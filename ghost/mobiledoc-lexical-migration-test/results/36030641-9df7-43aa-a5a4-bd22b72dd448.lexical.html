<p>Hook is a very simple puzzle game that requires you to retract all of the lines to complete a level. However, this is easier said than done. The lines must be retracted in specific orders as one line’s path may be blocked by another. The game starts off easy, but quickly becomes a head-scratching brain-twister as the levels become more complex.</p>

<p>Shadow Bug is a high intensity puzzle platformer with gorgeous canvas backgrounds and smooth fast-paced action. You can move the character slowly left and right, however you move much quicker and launch from the ground by touching the screen on an enemy, propelling you towards them. This makes for some fascinating gameplay mechanics and frantic boss fights. You can also use the gyro in the Joy-Cons, but the touch screen is admittedly much more precise.</p>

<p>Sushi Striker may not have received the success that Nintendo were hoping for, but the game is actually a well-crafted touch screen adventure that is brimming with a lot more content than you would expect. With fully voice acted anime cutscenes and approximately 25 hours worth of gameplay. Sushi Striker simultaneously released alongside the 3DS version leading us to speculate that Nintendo brought it over to the Switch as they were worried about how a new IP would do on the 3DS in 2018. But the touch screen nature of the game truly shows off the Switch’s screen capabilities with fast-paced match-up puzzle action.</p>
