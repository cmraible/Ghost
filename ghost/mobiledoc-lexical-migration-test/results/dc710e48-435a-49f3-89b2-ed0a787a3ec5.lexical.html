<p>Ferrari and Pininfarina. They're two great names that go together like chocolate and peanut butter. They've been together since the very beginning, and nearly every <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0023-1956-ferrari-250-gt-alloy-coupe-by-boano/1014899?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">Ferrari road car</a> bears that unmistakable Pinifarina styling that's become synonymous with the brand.</p>

<p>However, at the outset of 250 production, Ferrari and Pininfarina faced a serious problem. Pininfarina needed to expand to meet Ferrari's demand. While their new, larger facility was being constructed, Ferrari had to <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0023-1956-ferrari-250-gt-alloy-coupe-by-boano/1014899?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">find someone else</a> to help build the new car.</p>
<p>Enter Carrozzeria Boano. Boano would build between 68 and 80 Ferrari 250 coupes, with just 14 of them produced in lightweight aluminum. These <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0023-1956-ferrari-250-gt-alloy-coupe-by-boano/1014899?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">aluminum-bodied Boano coupes</a>, like the one seen here (chassis number 0613 GT) have become coveted by collectors.</p>

<p>Boano's styling is <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0023-1956-ferrari-250-gt-alloy-coupe-by-boano/1014899?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">strikingly distinct</a> from the later Pinifarina-bodied 250s. One hallmark of Pininfarina styling is the pronounced rear "haunches" of the car body. This feature has been imitated by countless manufacturers since.</p>
<p>Carrozzeria Boano took a different approach, smoothing the haunches and lowering the beltline. As a result, these cars have come to be known as "<a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0023-1956-ferrari-250-gt-alloy-coupe-by-boano/1014899?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21">low roof coupes</a>."</p>
