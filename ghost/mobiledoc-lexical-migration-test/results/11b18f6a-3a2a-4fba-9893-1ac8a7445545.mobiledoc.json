After saving up his money throughout high school, at the age of just 19 he bought a Black Diamond Edition car. There aren’t many of those around, so replacing the vehicle would be difficult if not impossible. According to Cadillac, the distinct tri-coat black paint is embedded with SpectraFlair Bright Silver pigment, which uses aluminum flakes encapsulated in magnesium fluoride, which is glass-like, giving the paint an extra sparkle."
