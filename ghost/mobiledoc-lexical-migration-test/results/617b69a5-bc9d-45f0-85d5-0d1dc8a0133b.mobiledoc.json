In what a local news station described as a “brazen” robbery, several men brandished firearms while taking 4 luxury vehicles from a parking garage in the trendy neighborhood of Tribeca, shocking many. That’s right, crime isn’t just contained to the less-affluent areas, because after practicing swiping Hyundais and Hellcats, the thieves decide to lick that brass ring for a change."
