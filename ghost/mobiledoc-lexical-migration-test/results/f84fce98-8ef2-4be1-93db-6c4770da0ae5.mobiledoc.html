<p>Several major brands enjoyed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-corporate-charlesschwab/charles-schwab-to-stop-political-donations-idUSL4N2JO4AT">good PR</a> for deciding to discontinue political action committee donations to Republican insurrectionist lawmakers after last January’s Trump-fueled riot at the U.S. Capitol. And while these companies talked a good game, they haven’t quite delivered on their promises.</p>

<p>“In 1978, as in other years, I hope to be able to play some role in making working people aware that the present-day reality of poverty, wage slavery, and mind-destroying media and schools is not the only reality — but simply a pathetic presentation brought to us by a handful of power-hungry individuals who own and control our economy.” — Sen. Bernie Sanders (then-leader of Vermont’s Liberty Union party) sharing his New Year’s resolution in a 1978 Vermont newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357980/increased-avoidance-care-drugs-due-cost-amid-pandemic.aspx">survey</a> conducted by Gallup and West Health last fall found that <strong>30 percent</strong> of U.S. adults had gone without treatment for a medical issue in the prior three months due to cost — up from 10 percent last March and 14 percent in June. What’s more, 42 percent of American adults now worry they will be unable to pay for needed healthcare in the next year.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>A year ago, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. <a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/lilly-suspends-contributions-to-four-indiana-members-of-congress-who-voted-against-electoral-college-certification">suspended political contributions</a> to four members of Congress from Indiana who voted against certifying the election of Joe Biden as president. “While we support candidates from both parties with a variety of political views, we expect any candidate we support to demonstrate respect for people and respect for our democratic process and institutions,” the Indianapolis-based company declared in a <a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/lilly-suspends-contributions-to-four-indiana-members-of-congress-who-voted-against-electoral-college-certification">statement</a> following the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>
<p>But it didn’t take long before Lilly’s political action committee made new donations to three of those four Indiana Republicans — Reps. Jackie Walorski, Jim Baird, and Greg Pence — along with 11 other GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying the Electoral College results. The corporation donated a whopping $32,500 to lawmakers who voted to overturn the election.</p>
<p>The drugmaker is hardly alone in quietly resuming political giving to insurrectionist lawmakers after vowing to do the opposite.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-corporate-insurrection-how-companies-have-broken-promises-and-funded-seditionists/">new report</a> from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, “Companies that pledged to stop or pause their political giving to these members have contributed a total of $4,785,000 to insurrectionist political groups, including $2,381,250 directly to members of the Sedition Caucus’s campaigns and leadership PACs.” Toyota, Cigna, and AT&T all resumed donating to insurrectionist Republicans within a couple months of the insurrection.</p>

<p>What’s more, many companies never stopped funding Republican Party-aligned super PACs — <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-slush-fund-bankrolling-the-insurrectionist/">the real pool of cash</a> supporting authoritarian extremists in the GOP.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>PROGRESSIVES CALL FOR U.S. NAVY FACILITY SHUTDOWN: </strong>Yesterday, members of the<a href="https://twitter.com/ProgIntl"></a>Progressive International Council <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgIntl/status/1478290108818227201?t=ASoJFHq83iO6Lo3L8EmZ-g&s=19">released a statement</a> urging the U.S. government to immediately shut down the leaking Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Honolulu and provide full reparations for its victims. The statement — signed by prominent leftists like Noam Chomsky, Cornel West, and Naomi Klein — outlines the atrocities committed by the U.S. Navy in its continued operation of the Red Hill site, including leaking at least 180,000 gallons of petroleum-based fuel and toxic chemicals into the island’s soil and water. “Poisoning drinking water has sickened entire communities. Fumes emanate from the ground and taps. Hundreds of families have left or been evaluated from their homes with no assurance where they will now live,” the statement said.</li>
    <li><strong>FORMER PELOSI STAFFER BECOMES CORPORATE LOBBYIST: </strong>Jorge Aguilar, a senior aide of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2022/01/03/pelosi-aide-joins-thegroup-799639">has taken a plum job</a> at theGROUP, a D.C. lobbying firm that raked in more than $5 million last year <a href="https://twitter.com/Sludge/status/1478116664264769537">lobbying for corporate behemoths</a> like Pfizer, Lockheed Martin, and Altria. Aguilar was a staffer for Pelosi for almost a decade and most recently led her campaign committee. According to <em>Politico</em>, he “will advise clients on how to navigate ‘the intricacies of the Democratic Caucus in Congress and key stakeholder organizations.’” Aguilar’s move marks the latest example of Washington’s notorious revolving door, by which Hill staffers move from public service to lucrative corporate gigs on K Street.</li>

    <li><strong>AN EFFORT TO END THE PANDEMIC: </strong>A team of scientists at the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development (Texas Children’s CVD) and Baylor College of Medicine have <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-covid-vaccine-for-all/">created</a> CORBEVAX, a COVID vaccine ready for mass distribution as the Omicron variant <a href="https://twitter.com/RothTheReporter/status/1478238639230529537">sets global records</a> for new COVID infections. In the final week of last year, the Indian government greenlit vaccine manufacturer BioE’s forthcoming distribution of 300 million doses of CORBEVAX to the Indian population, as well as more than one billion doses to other countries in the coming months. Meanwhile pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-invented-covid-vaccines-11640726776">continue to fight</a> over COVID vaccine patent rights and President Biden <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/12/joe-biden-is-dragging-his-feet-on-sharing-vaccine-information-with-the-world">drags his feet</a> on sharing vaccine information with the world. “The only thing we know how to do is make low-cost straightforward vaccines for use in resource-poor settings, and that was the failure of the global policy leaders,” <a href="https://twitter.com/democracynow/status/1477995023195062277?t=G1n3cyHl1p3PSywDNsNu_g&s=19">said</a> Dr. Peter Hotez of Texas Children's Hospital, one of the scientists who helped develop CORBEVAX. “They never had any interest in that — it was always about speed and innovation and enough interesting vaccines for North America and Europe without any attention to the rest of the world.”</li>
    <li><strong>ANTI-HANDOUT GROUPS QUIETLY POCKETED GOVERNMENT AID: </strong>New research from watchdog group Accountable.US <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/12/21/ppp-loans-prager-university-hypocrisy/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=theintercept&utm_source=twitter">reveals</a> right-wing groups notorious for opposing “government handouts” cashed in big on federal aid during 2020. The conservative organizations, including Prager University Foundation, the Ayn Rand Institute, and Americans for Tax Reform, received more than $1.7 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans doled out by the Small Business Administration in the wake of the COVID pandemic. Some of the groups saw sizable gains in contributions or net revenue while raking in hefty government subsidies. As <em>The Intercept </em><a href="https://twitter.com/theintercept/status/1477807568395415559?t=fmQnKo1l7jBFp6ZWa_pKuQ&s=19">reported</a>, Prager University Foundation received more than $704,000 in PPP loans the same year it saw a $12.3 million increase in contributions from 2019.</li>
