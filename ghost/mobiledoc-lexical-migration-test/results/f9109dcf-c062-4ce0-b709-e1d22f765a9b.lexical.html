<hr>
<p>Ferrari has always been at the forefront of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/el-chapos-mclaren-f1/">F1 racing</a> technology. From their first-ever win in the British Grand Prix to their recent advancements in modern-day racing, Ferrari has always been at the top of its game. Today's subject of discussion is the perfect example of such. Recently the anniversary has passed for Ferrariâ€™s first-ever F1 win in the 1951 British Grand Prix. While we couldn't catch it on the exact day we can still celebrate as it is the same month that this incredible car first crossed the finish line in the F1 competition. Of course, the coming of the 70th anniversary also brings intense celebration within the Ferrari community. This celebration comes in the form of the original car's full restoration, being brought back to life to race in the 2021 British <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-monaco/">Grand Prix</a>.</p>

<p>Restoring a vehicle such as this one was quite a large project but the team was dedicated to their dream of making history once again with this beautiful car. Each part has been completely refurbished. Everything from the chassis to the drivetrain has been inspected and revitalized to reinvigorate the spirit of the original Ferrari 375 F1 racer. Special attention was put towards the gearbox as it helps to transfer power from the beautiful 4.5-liter V12 engine and allows for smooth and quick transitions from gear to gear.</p>
<p>When all is said and done this incredible beast will dawn the bright Rosso Corsa red once again to drive the track at the 2021 British Grand Prix at Silverstone Raceway. This restored racer will be driven by Charles Leclerc, a world-renowned successful F1 driver. Finally, this car will feel the heat of the asphalt once again for the first time in over 10 years.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSx5-EC0Tuc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
