Ford and Mercury had the Torino and Cyclone as their race cars that they upgraded with the respective Talladega and Spoiler II packages. These cars kicked off the battle, however, Dodge had its rebuttal and in 1969 it released a special edition model that absolutely dominated in the aero-wars - the "
