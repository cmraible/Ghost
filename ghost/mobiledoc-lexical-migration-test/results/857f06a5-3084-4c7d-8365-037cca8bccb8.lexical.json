Look, Jeep puts Trail Rated badges on Renegades these days; badges mean whatever the automaker wants them to. One person astutely pointed out the Hellcat engine isn’t going anywhere because Stellantis just dropped it into the Ram TRX. That makes perfect sense to the illogical, I guess.

Yes, having an opinion contrary to others in 2021 now constitutes “bias.” How dare I question what my betters have planned for society?",
