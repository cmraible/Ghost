          " has been one of the coolest subgenres of the automotive enthusiast industry since the early 1960s. As Porsche continued to grow as a brand, so did its influence and sway with car lovers. One model which has gained a high level of priority with car fans everywhere is the 911, but there is another car that rivals even the best examples of the 911. That vehicle was the predecessor to the iconic Porsche we all know and love, deemed the Porsche 356. Having been made around three years before the debut of the 911, this particular car is an incredibly unique and desirable performance vehicle with style to match."

          " is a 1.6-liter flat-four engine that sits behind the rear axle of this lightweight European sports car. It could be said that, alongside Japanese manufacturers, German automakers utilize some of the best engineering techniques in history. Everything about the mechanics is complex enough to produce a mighty machine while still retaining the simplicity that has kept it running for so many years. Unlike some of its German counterparts, cars like this one can often be quite reliable, especially when taken care of like this."

          " by the current owner over 30 years ago, this car is nearly as pristine as the day it rolled off the production floor. All of this is thanks to a detailed bare-metal repaint performed in the early 2000s, which cleaned up the car very nicely. Finally, you have what is likely the most desirable part of this car, the four-speed manual transaxle. This stick-shift gearbox combines the best performance and control, making it one of the most memorable driving experiences available on the classic car collectors market today. That's why you should consider this stunning 1960 Porsche 356B for your automotive collection."
