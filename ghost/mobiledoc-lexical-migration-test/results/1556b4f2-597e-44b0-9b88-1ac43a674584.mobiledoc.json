Instead of the base 330 hp tune, though, Callaway bored and stroked the LT4 to a 383 cubic-inch displacement upping its power output to 450 hp â€“ the 1991 B2K Callaway produced 403 hp. As rare as the C4 Callaway Corvettes are these days, this one is even more of a collector's car since it has just over 10,000 miles showing on the odometer."
