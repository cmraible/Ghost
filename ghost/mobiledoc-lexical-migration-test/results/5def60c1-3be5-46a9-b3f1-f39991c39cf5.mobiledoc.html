<p>Federal Reserve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/jerome-powell/">Chairman Jerome Powell</a> recently screamed the quiet part out loud when he said the central bank was raising interest rates to “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-declares-war-on-workers/">get wages down</a>.”</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiKV5n7pBo0">latest video demonstrates</a>, Powell has also simultaneously <a href="__GHOST_URL__/powell-lets-wall-street-pay-skyrocket-while-targeting-workers-wages/">declined to use</a> his authority to address record Wall Street bonuses.</p>
<p>Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiKV5n7pBo0">new video</a> about the Biden administration’s troubling response to inflation — moves that will likely increase unemployment and make it less likely for workers to form unions, and won’t solve any of the main drivers of the price increases Americans are experiencing. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/LeverNews/status/1545087579061735426">share it on social media</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-declares-war-on-workers/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/powell-lets-wall-street-pay-skyrocket-while-targeting-workers-wages/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
