There’s the windshield banner, the relic from the early 2000s we thankfully don’t see too often these days. Also, after doing all those super-aggressive mods this Camaro owner didn’t add hood pins. Did he not hear those add 5-horsepower each? Well, we guess his perfect project car is still a work in progress, because he likely skipped the LED windshield washer nozzles and tire stem caps, good for another 20-hp."
