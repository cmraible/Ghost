Who could forget models like the GTO, regarded as the world's first popularized muscle car? Or perhaps you'd instead focus on the pony car competitor, the Pontiac Firebird.

This piston-turner utilizes 400 cubic inches of displacement to put out a potent 350 horsepower, which was ridiculous for the time it was made. The fact is that this car was compelling for its era, as even the most potent vehicle of the time was right around that figure. Speed, luxury, and style were finally available in one particular automobile, which was revolutionary. Now you can own a piece of automotive history with all of the prestige of a classic which still retains its unique style and passion for performance."
