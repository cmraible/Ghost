<p>On this episode, Sirota was joined by <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs Julia Rock and Producer Frank to discuss whether Biden should run for reelection - and whether he will face a Democratic primary challenge if he does. They answered major questions such as:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Should Biden run for reelection?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Should there be a primary challenge to the incumbent Democratic president if he runs for reelection?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Who would be the best Democratic candidate to run against a Trump-style Republican in 2024?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Can Biden‚Äôs approval ratings get any lower?</p>
