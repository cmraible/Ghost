This Starwood build takes the Wrangler and the JK-8 idea to the highest level starting with a lifted Fox suspension, 37-inch mud tires on 22-inch Fuel wheels and a supercharged 7.0-liter Hemi V8. This Jeep is an absolute monster, and it certainly looks the part."

Of course, looking at that high-lux interior with quilted leather and custom sound system, this 2014 Jeep Wrangler JK-8 conversion will undoubtedly be relegated to show-car duty its whole life, and it will look darn good in the process!"
