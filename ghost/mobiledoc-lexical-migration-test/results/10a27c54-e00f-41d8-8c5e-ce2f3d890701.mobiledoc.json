Surveillance video from a pizzeria shows the whole horrific scene unfold, although the video quality is a little grainy since it isn’t HD, but it’s good enough to portray what happened."

However, there is no barrier between the higher, smaller road and the lower, larger road. The first car and the motorcycle both slow down and cautiously make a left turn, but the second car just goes straight, plunging off the higher road and landing right on the roof of the Camaro."

Either way, watching the roof get peel off is scary since fatal injuries to anyone in the car wouldn’t have been the least bit surprising. Also, the drunk driver was fortunate he didn’t hit the bus that was on the busier road just seconds before, otherwise he might have been seriously injured or killed."

Unfortunately, four people were injured, although we couldn’t find any information about just how seriously other than the driver of the Camaro, the only one in the car, was is serious but not fatal condition. The fact the Camaro driver wasn’t decapitated or crushed to death by this drunk driver is nothing short of a Christmas miracle, so we’re grateful for that much."
