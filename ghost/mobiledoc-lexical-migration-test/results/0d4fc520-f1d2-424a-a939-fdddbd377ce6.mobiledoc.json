Valued at over $200,000 according to the Tulsa Police Department, it’s not just any classic Ford Mustang. Of course, as an enthusiast you probably already know that and so did the thieves."

When announcing the theft to the public, the official page cracks a Gone In 60 Seconds joke. This Shelby isn’t anything like Eleanor, but they just had to go there. They also reference the crappy 2000 remake and Nicholas Cage, showing whoever is managing the social media accounts has little appreciation of classic car movies. Sad."

Police also note this GT500 has a “fairly loud exhaust.” Aftermarket gauges have been installed, which you can kind of see in the photo of the interior. It looks like a fire extinguisher is mounted between the seats, plus a red racing harness is shown in the one photo."

A Shelby American Racing vinyl banner is on the windshield, which they might have also taken off. However, there aren’t too many ’67 Shelby GT500s out there, so hiding this thing is going to be difficult because of that."
