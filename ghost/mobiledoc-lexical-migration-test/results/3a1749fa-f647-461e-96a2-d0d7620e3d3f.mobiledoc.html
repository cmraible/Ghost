<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The Daily Poster has been shaping the political debate over the promised $2,000 checks — and other media outlets are taking notice. Clearly, our accountability journalism is helping drive politics right now — even as some folks try to bully and silence us.</p>
<p><strong>But as a grassroots-funded news outlet, we need free subscribers to <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to help us keep doing this work. We cannot do it without you.</strong></p>

<p>You don’t have to believe us when we say we’re making an impact. This week alone, the <em>Washington Post</em>’s top political reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1359225670409342982">said</a> that “<em>The Daily Poster</em> became a must-read in a hurry.” Meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1359307675255918598">NBC</a> pointed to our reporting in a segment shaming the Biden administration for trying to limit the checks. Even the great Killer Mike <a href="https://twitter.com/KillerMike/status/1359897329072025602">touted</a> the pressure we are putting on lawmakers to make good on their promise to send the checks out.</p>
