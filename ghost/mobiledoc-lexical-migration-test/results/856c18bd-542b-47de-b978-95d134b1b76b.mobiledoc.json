A tribute to the classic Bugatti Baby, a creation Ettore Bugatti gifted to his youngest son Roland, they’re a 75% scale, fully-electric recreation of the Bugatti Type 35. We think these kids are super lucky. And if you think these smaller cars were cheap, well they’re not as expensive as a Chiron, know they start at $40,000. The man bought 6 of these, but we think it wasn’t that much money relative to his financial means."
