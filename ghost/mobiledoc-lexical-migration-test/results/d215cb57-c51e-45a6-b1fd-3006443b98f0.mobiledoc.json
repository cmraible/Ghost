The premise is pretty hilarious in itself and I found myself laughing on occasion that I was using molotov cocktails or a shotgun to kill a spider. The levels are intelligently designed and, most importantly, the game is incredibly fun. Most of the time when I am playing through a game for a review, I feel the need to take a break to play a game I know I already enjoy, but this title gripped me in a way few other games I've reviewed have. If I had one suggestion to the developers, it would be to look into VR; this game could really benefit from that level of immersion."
