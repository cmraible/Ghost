<hr>
<p>Lately, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">Hoonigan</a> has been doing quarter-mile drag races between <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevelle-races-nissan-skyline/">seemingly mismatched cars</a>. It’s an interesting new series called This vs. That. So far the most interesting matchups we’ve seen include a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1966-buick-gasser-toyota-supra/">2020 Toyota Supra race a 1966 Buick Gasser</a> and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-demon-lamborghini-huracan/">Dodge Demon go up against a supercharged Lamborghini Huracan</a>. These quarter-mile showdowns haven’t gone exactly the way we’ve expected, but this one between a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1967-chevrolet-camaro/">1967 Chevy Camaro</a> with a big V8 and a little 2019 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/toyota-tacoma-nascar-v8/">Toyota</a> Corolla hatchback seems cruel. Obviously, the little <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevelle-races-nissan-skyline/">Japanese car is way out of its league</a>.</p>
<p>That little Corolla is pushing 950-horsepower via aggressive turbocharging versus 850-hp for the Camaro, which might give you some pause. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rare-1967-toyota-2000gt/">Toyota</a> is also armed with a 5-speed sequential gearbox, but the Chevy is using a 2-speed Powerglide. You’ll also note the Camaro has the hood scoop from hell (but it’s an all-motor car) and a wheelie bar. Both cars have full cages and tip the scale at 3,200 pounds – bet you didn’t see that one coming.</p>
<p>In other words, this is a fairer fight than you’d think at first glance. Of course, the two cars are still wildly different, one using a super-boosted four-banger and the other relying on its built V8. The driver of the Camaro wouldn’t even let the film crew see under the hood at first, just like any secretive street racer.</p>
<p>What’s really going against the Corolla is that it’s built to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/totaled-ferrari-456-turned-into-rotary-powered-drift-car/">competition drift specifications</a>, so it’s not set up for drag racing. Of course, that means it’s a rear-wheel-drive car, which helps, but the Camaro is a whole lot of car. Definitely, this matchup is a David and Goliath situation.</p>
<p>The guys at Hoonigan overwhelmingly bet on the ’67 Camaro winning the race, but which one would you pick? Choosing the Camaro is definitely the safe option, but is it possible the Corolla will pull a rabbit out of its hat? Check out the video to see how this plays out.</p>
