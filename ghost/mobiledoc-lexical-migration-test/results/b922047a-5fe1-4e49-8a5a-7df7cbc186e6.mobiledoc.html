<p>The key to that blazing performance is a modern 5.3-liter V8 with fuel injection. It works smoothly with a 4L80E automatic transmission with overdrive plus a GM 10-bolt limited-slip rear axle, so you can put that power to the back wheels efficiently. You also get power steering so there’s not muscling this ride through turns, plus four-wheel power disc brakes bring everything to a halt reliably.</p>

<p>A silky smooth silver metallic paint is draped over each body panel. Paired with flawless brightwork literally from one bumper to the other, plus 17-inch chrome American Racing wheels, this truck is drop-dead gorgeous. Under the skin is a GM subframe with drop spindles.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the interior has been completely overhauled. Bold red leather covers the seats, door panels, steering wheel rim, and even the headliner for a premium feeling. It pairs up with new chrome hardware, adding even more glitz to the cab. The original gauges, heater, and air conditioning are still working. Some nice amenities are included in the truck, like electric wipers, tilt steering column adjustment,</p>
<p>Despite a completely new truck slated to debuted for 1955, Chevrolet decided to give the 3100 a restyling. Among the changes was a curved one-piece windshield, plus revised designs for the grille and front turn signal lights. The cargo box had a lower load height and taller sides. For the interior, two instrument dials were included in the dash. Since this truck marks the end of an era at a time when GM was riding high and dominating the market it holds some significant historical value.
