<hr>
<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/beta-texans-dream-cars/">severe storm</a> on the night of April 28 absolutely decimated a classic car dealership, Lakeway Auto Sales, in Paris, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/small-tennessee-dealer/">Tennessee</a>. Henry County authorities put residents under tornado warnings, but no twisters were reported. The carnage from the storm would’ve been far worse, however it looks like the classic cars bore the brunt of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wisconsin-rioters-loot/">destruction</a>.</p>

<p>The devastation captured by a local news crew looks absolutely awful, including a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-tri-five-ls/">Chevy Tri-Five</a> buried under debris which used to be the dealership structure. The rear passenger-side corner of a Corvette can be seen just beyond the Tri-Five. Another photo shows a Chevy truck partially <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wildfires-destroy-classic-cars/">buried by debris</a> from the dealership, which looks to no longer be standing at all. It’s not clear how much damage has been done to any of the cars since all the photos were taken at night and from a distance.</p>

<p>According to local officials, the entire Lakeway Auto Sales dealership was destroyed by the storm. Sadly, 3 homes were also destroyed. Over 40 homes and 10 mobile homes in the area were also damaged, some by falling trees. However, nobody was seriously injured in the chaos, which seems pretty miraculous.</p>
<p>While it’s always sad to see such devastation done to classic cars of any kind, even worse is the fact someone’s business, the livelihood of them and their employees, has been destroyed. Hopefully the insurance covers most if not all of the damage, but while rebuilding the dealership might face an uncertain future.</p>

<p>This should as a start reminder to everyone to double-check the insurance on their collectible cars, whether they’re classics or more modern. Disaster can strike at any time, so it’s good to be fully prepared. Also, it doesn’t hurt to ensure you have a good fire-suppression system in place in your garage and workshop along with other safety measures.</p>
