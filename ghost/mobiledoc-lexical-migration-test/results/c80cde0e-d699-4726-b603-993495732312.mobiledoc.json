The list of mods are long, ranging from port and polished heads to a performance cam. With a 6-speed manual transmission, the driver has at his disposal 415-horsepower at the rear wheels. Ultimately, the plan is to add boost, which will make this Chevelle’s performance even more impressive."

What he always wanted was a Chevelle, a car he thought was absolutely beautiful, and he isn’t alone in that estimation. As luck would have it, there was a Chevelle on his paper route, but it wasn’t pretty at all. The car had front-end damage, was gutted, and had been left under a tarp. With a vision in mind, the 11 year old made the purchase."

It shows real determination and grit to keep that dream alive when most people would just throw in the towel and move on to sitting on the couch. It’s far more inspirational than seeing a rich guy buy one and hire a shop to go over it for a full restoration, which has its charm but isn’t nearly as relatable for the vast majority of us."
