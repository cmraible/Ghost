<h3 id="this-was-one-of-the-last-air-cooled-911-turbos">This was one of the last air-cooled 911 Turbos.</h3>
<p>Go ahead and admit you’ve fantasized about owning a real air-cooled <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche/911" rel="nofollow">Porsche 911</a>. They’ve become exclusive and highly sought-after, but this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/184707/1997-porsche-911-turbo-s" rel="nofollow">1997 Porsche 911 Turbo S</a> is a standout even among air-cooled models. Standing at the pinnacle of air-cooled performance, it was the swan song of an era closing in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a> dynasty, destined to be praised for generations. If you have the means, this is a car you can thoroughly enjoy and count on continuing to appreciate in value.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to love about the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche/993" rel="nofollow">Porsche 993</a>, especially the limited-run Turbo S from 1997. For one, the 3.6-liter turbocharged flat-six engine pumps out an extra 40-horsepower, making it a little quicker than its Turbo sibling. Improved aero and suspension heightened performance further, so this car is truly worthy of the “S” on the rear.</p>
<p>This particular <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">car</a> looks sophisticated yet menacing with a silky black exterior and factory treatments. That includes the original wheels in excellent condition, plus badging and that iconic 993 Turbo rear wing that’s a calling card to enthusiasts. If you look closely, yellow brake calipers and cross-drilled rotors peek out from behind the wheels.</p>
<p>Inside is a well-preserved two-tone black and tan color scheme. The dash is free of damage, as are the soft leather seats. Factory details like the gauges, steering wheel, and shifter carefully preserve this classic Porsche. On the odometer is a mere 25,000 miles and this car has only had two owners, who both obviously valued this vehicle highly.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a mere 345 1997 Turbo S models were made. As you can imagine, each one is now considered highly collectible. If you want to find out about getting this Porsche 911 Turbo S before it’s gone, contact <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Road+Scholars">Road Scholars</a> for the details. Letting this one slip though your fingers might be a decision you truly regret in just a few years.</p>
