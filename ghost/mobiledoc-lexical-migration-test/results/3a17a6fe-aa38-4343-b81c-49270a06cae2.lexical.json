Even more, it fires right up thanks to an MSD ignition system and wires along with an HEI distributor and coil. A complete serpentine pulley system was also installed, and keeping the temperature in check is the addition of a B Cool radiator with electric fans. Added performance and rumble comes from powder-coated Hooker headers. The M21 transmission was rebuilt in 2018 and installed in the car with a new clutch. Torque is transferred to the 3.55 positraction rear axle and on to the rear wheels.",
