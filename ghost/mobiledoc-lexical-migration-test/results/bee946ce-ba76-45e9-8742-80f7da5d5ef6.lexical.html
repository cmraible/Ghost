<p>Generally speaking, when an automaker creates a continuation series of vintage cars, these cars are made to the exact specs to which they were originally built. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1985-aston-martin-lagonda/">Aston Martin</a> DB5 Goldfinger Continuation is a unique exception to that rule since it's being recreated not to its factory specs but rather to its original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/15-movie-cars/">starring role</a> in the 1964 James Bond film, <em>Goldfinger</em>. </p>
<p>Speaking of starring roles, Aston Martin has released a video of the DB5 Continuation in action with all of its 007-style goodies. </p>

<p>Only 25 of these movie-based continuation cars are being built, and just like 007's first DB5, these Aston Martins will have their aluminum bodies painted in Silver Birch with modifications similar to what Q would given to James Bond. Aston Martin teamed up with the production company behind the <em>James Bond</em> movie franchise to make detailed recreations that feature simulated twin front machine guns mounted behind the headlights, battering rams front and rear, bullet resistant rear shield, smoke screen, revolving license plates and a simulated oil slick delivery, while the interior gets <em>007 </em>touches like remote control for gadgets, radar tracking screen, hidden storage compartments for James Bond's weapons.</p>
<p>It's been 55 years since the last DB5 was built where Aston Martin says that fewer than 900 DB5s were built from 1963 through 1965, and aside from the James Bond gadgetry, the Aston Martin DB5 Goldfinger Continuation will look and run just like they originally did. Under the hood, these cars are powered by a 4.0-liter inline-six that produces 290 horsepower, and it's paired with a five-speed manual gearbox. To ensure these cars have optimal handling to get away from evil villains, they are equipped with coil over springs, a limited slip differential and manual rack and pinion steering.</p>
<p>There's no doubt these 25 cars will be a huge hit among Aston Martin collectors, and each will be priced starting at around $3.4 million. That's about $3 million short of the $6.4 million price tag that a James Bond promotional vehicle – with fully functional gadgets – sold for at last year's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/70th-pebble-beach-concours-postponed-covid-19/">Monterey Car Week</a>.</p>
