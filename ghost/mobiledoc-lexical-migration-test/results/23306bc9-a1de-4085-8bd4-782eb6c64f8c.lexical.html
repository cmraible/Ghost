<hr>
<p>As the Porsche 914 continues to grow in popularity as a collector car, it is getting harder to find these cars in good, original condition. If you're looking for a classic Porsche that is both a solid investment and an instant ticket to one of the best car clubs in the U.S. (Porsche Club of America), then this original, two-owner <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/cars/1975-porsche-914_6002?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1975 Porsche 914 2.0</a> being sold by <a href="http://motorgroupllc.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Motorgroup Auto Gallery</a> is the car for you.</p>

<p>Where this car stands out from many other 914s out there is its well-documented history and incredible, unrestored condition. Both are the result of this car spending its entire life on the West Coast with just two owners who drove the car a total of just over 72,000 miles. Many of the parts are original to the car such as the engine, transmission interior, glass and even the spare tire. To ensure this classic Porsche is ready for any road trip, this 1975 Porsche 914 was recently serviced and it wears new tires and brakes as well a newer Blaupunkt stereo system.</p>
<p>Sold new in San Jose, California in 1975, this Porsche 914 was sold to its second and current owner in 1977 who had the car registered in California and later Oregon. This pampered, West Coast life is obvious in the overall condition with the paint, interior and event the undercarriage appearing in impressive condition. There's no doubt this 914 could be a show-winning Porsche today, but it's just a light restoration away from being a concours-quality car!</p>
<p>This well-kept Porsche 914 is being sold for $33,995, and as prices of these cars continue to rise, this one probably won't last long at this price.
