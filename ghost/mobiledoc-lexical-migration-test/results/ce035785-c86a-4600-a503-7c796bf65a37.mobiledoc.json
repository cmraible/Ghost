Despite some incredible driving on the part of the '35 Ford, the Mustang passed it with one fell swoop in the final turn of the battle. This was done by taking the outside of the turn and then changing direction for the second turn while still in the first, this put the Mustang into a position where it was already on the inside of the turn and was able to overtake the hot rod. The scene ends with the two cars lining up and the Mustang triumphantly declaring its victory with a cloud of blue smoke."
