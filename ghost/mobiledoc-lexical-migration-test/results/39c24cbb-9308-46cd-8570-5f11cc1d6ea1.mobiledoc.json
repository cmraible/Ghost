          "For many, Richard Hammond is the most lovable of the hosts for The Grand Tour. He’s pretty goofy, lacks any kind of pretenses, and is overall relatable to the average enthusiast. However, the man has one huge weakness: he’s prone to crashing cars. Out of all the man’s close calls, it was his brush with death in the jet-powered Vampire dragster which still haunts him. And now, Hammond is facing his would-be killer to overcome his fears."

The jet-powered race car theoretically could hit 370 mph, although Hammond never was able to prove if it was true. During a run, one of the tires blew, sending the vehicle rolling."

He had to be airlifted to the hospital and went through a long recovery. However, it was not all for nothing, because during a previous run Hammond set the British land speed record in the Vampire."

However, in the teaser we only get to see Hammond climb into the seat, not actually drive the Vampire dragster again. But it seems like that’s what we’re going to see at a later date. No doubt, this is to get people excited and watching DriveTribe this year, but it might work quite well considering the significance of the event."
