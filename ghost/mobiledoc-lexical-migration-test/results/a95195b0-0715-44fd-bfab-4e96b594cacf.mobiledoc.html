<p><a href="https://corvettemike.com/used-corvettes-for-sale/1967-sunfire-yellow-l88-corvette-coupe/">The 1967 L88 Corvette</a> is the best of the best in terms of performance when it comes to the second generation. They featured a high-performance 427-cid big block engine mated to a heavy duty M22 'Rock Crusher' 4-speed manual transmission and nearly every race ready option GM had to offer. Its ultra-high-performance engine pumped out over 500-horsepower, and the transmission was nearly unbreakable. Suspension components were as heavy-duty as was ever put in a GM car and there was no need for a heater. Visually, the cars were not much different from every other <a href="https://corvettemike.com/used-corvettes-for-sale/1967-sunfire-yellow-l88-corvette-coupe/">1967 Corvette</a> with the exception of the iconic L88 hood. However, unlike any Corvette that came before, these cars did not have any standard comfort or convenience features. They were produced for one thing only-speed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the L88 was a limited edition and only 20 of these incredible cars were made in 1967 and since they were intended for the race track, most of them did not survive. Of the around <a href="https://corvettemike.com/used-corvettes-for-sale/1967-sunfire-yellow-l88-corvette-coupe/">10 1967 L88’s</a> still around today, only three were taken care of well enough to still have their original engine. Two are convertible and one is a coupe. As you can imagine, that surviving L88 coupe is a Corvette enthusiast's dream.</p>

<p>“This L88 represents the pinnacle of Corvette collecting,” said Corvette Mike Vietro. “No other Corvette in the world can claim such rarity. We are honored to now own this car. It’s been a dream of mine for decades.”</p>
