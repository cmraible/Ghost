<p>The guys from <em>Adventures With Purpose</em> recently braved the frigid waters of a Portland, Oregon river to drag a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mazda/RX-7">Mazda RX-7</a> up to the surface. As it turns out, that was one of just six <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/classic-and-vintage">classic </a>vehicles they found at the edge of this boat launch, so now they've returned to clean up the riverbed a little more by pulling another car from the murky water. This time, they believe they've hooked up to a 1973 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford/Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> Mach 1!</p>

<p>The first attempt to bring this Mustang to the surface resulted in the engine being ripped from the transmission and being brought to shore by itself, and the V8 sported some long-tube headers suggest that this was a souped-up car before it was unceremoniously dumped in the river. On the second try, the crew is successful in bringing the Mustang to the surface, where the unmistakable SportsRoof body style is instantly obvious. </p>
<p>Years spent underwater resulted in extensive rot to this body, but this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">Mustang fastback</a> design at least seemed to have held its distinctive shape. That is until the car – packed full of mud – approached dry land. While there's nothing left of the car to save, there's no doubt that it does help preserve the river and its ecosystem a little longer.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to watching more episodes from <em>Adventures With Purpose</em> to see the other four cars pulled from their watery graves.</p>
