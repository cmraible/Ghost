<hr>
<p>These days it’s not too unusual to hear about law enforcement in countries like Australia seizing a car as it’s being imported from a foreign country. What is shocking is to hear New South Wales police took a 1960 Bentley S2 that’s supposedly worth over $140 million. After all, the most expensive classic Bentley we’ve ever heard of was the 1932 Blower which sold at auction in the UK for $7 million.</p>

<p>It turns out this Bentley S2 is worth so much not because of its rarity or provenance, but rather what was hidden inside. A tipster told police they ought the inspect the British car as it was shipped from Canada to a buyer Down Under. They decided to serve a warrant for the car at the home after it was delivered, then proceeded to X-ray the classic, revealing it indeed was carrying hidden cargo.</p>

<p>That’s when they popped off the headlights, revealing bags of methamphetamine. It seems Walter White is still at it. After police went through the vehicle with a fine-tooth comb, they netted not only 350 pounds of meth but 132 pounds of cocaine. Police say the street value of the illegal drugs is about $115 million, hence why the classic Bentley value was so high.</p>
<p>Police took two men, a 22-year-old and a 23-year-old, into custody. Both are facing several drug trafficking charges. Detectives continued working the case, arresting two more people and seizing an additional five pounds of meth along with $750,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Transporting drugs in cars is far from a new scheme, although we don’t hear about classic Bentleys being used all that often. Thankfully, police were able to grab the goods before they helped wreck countless more lives.</p>
