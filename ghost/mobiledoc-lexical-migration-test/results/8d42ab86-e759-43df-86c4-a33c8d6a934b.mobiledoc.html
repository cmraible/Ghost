<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This is a message asking for your help — and it is important: To expand our work, we need about 50 free subscribers to <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> right now to become supporting subscribers. We are grassroots funded, so that’s the only way we can hire more reporters.</p>
<p><a href="#/portal/signup">Subscribe now</a></p>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/aa47e675">click here and subscribe using this special link</a>, you get a discount. This discount is available for the first 50 folks who use it.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-year-of-accountability-journalism/">Take a look</a> at all the accountability journalism we did last year - and we can do even more with your help. But we can only do this kind of work with your help.</p>
<p><strong>So if you’ve been thinking about becoming a subscriber, PLEASE - <a href="#/portal/signup">do it now</a>.</strong></p>
<p>When you subscribe, you get access to all of our live events where you get to ask newsmakers questions (including <a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-live-chat-with-rep-db4/">tonight’s big event</a>!). You also get all of our exclusive subscriber only content. And we are planning to add more of this content if we get enough subscribers to expand.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request - we wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,<br>Sirota</p>
