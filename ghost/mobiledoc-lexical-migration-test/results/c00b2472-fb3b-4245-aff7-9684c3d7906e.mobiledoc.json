Considering the platform and the fact that the yearly show in Las Vegas is the biggest aftermarket show in the world, builders and cars recognized under this title are the best of the best, and this Camaro was the very first to get the recognition. The awards don’t stop there though, the car has also won awards for the Goodguys PPG Dream Car, Goodguys Street Machine of the Year, and General Motors design award for Best Chevrolet Sports Car."

          "So you get the idea, this Camaro is full of prestige, but does it have the goods to back all this up? Short answer: Absolutely. The heart of this builder is a MAST Motorsports built blown LSX 427 cubic-inch engine that processes around 800-horsepower at the crank. Backing the beast of an engine is a TKO five-speed manual transmission, and the car rolls on a full Detroit Speed suspension. With this kind of powertrain, great braking power is absolutely needed, which comes from upgraded Baer brakes."
