I haven't seen them this whole time!\" Not to worry! Simply make sure you've changed out of your Jack costume and into your regular Halloween attire. Talk to all of your villagers and participate in the usual \"trick or treat\" exchange. This time, instead of giving you candy they'll be asking you for it. Trust me, you'll want to give it to them. Your villagers will reward you with spooky items, teaching spooky reactions, and even sometimes lollipops as a grand gesture. It's more rare to come by, but if you continue to follow the tips listed above, you'll see: the more candy you have, the better. And it's worth it, because giving Jack lollipops will yield better results in what you receive from him. ",
