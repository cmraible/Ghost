<hr>
<p>According to a local report, 26-year-old Tyris Davontae Edmondson of Kinston, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/two-cars-found-lake/">North Carolina</a> has been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-hellcats-hot-thieves/">arrested</a> for a string of charges linked with the alleged burning of his own Cadillac. Yes, this seems to possibly be an actual case of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/muscle/street-racer-insurance-fraud/">insurance fraud</a>, something too many immediately go to when they read about someone having their car stolen, or worse someone like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dominic-cooper-5-cars-thieves/">Dominic Cooper being targeted by thieves repeatedly</a>.</p>

<p>After conducting an investigation, special agents from the Department of Insurance Criminal Investigations Division say Edmonson incinerated his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/two-guys-start-1941-cadillac/">2007 Cadillac</a> so he could collect on the insurance policy. They claim the man torched his luxury vehicle sometime between October 13, 2020 and November 2, 2020. Edmondson was arrested on June 22, 2021 by Kinston police and special agents. An arrest warrant states the man falsely reported to his insurance provider and to the local police that his Cadillac had been stolen.</p>
<p>Not only did Edmondson try to collect money for the supposed theft of his vehicle, he also received compensation for a rental car. That latter offense reportedly cost his insurance provider $649.48. While that might not sound like a big deal, if you’re wondering why you shell out so much for insurance, part of the reason is fraud.</p>
<p>The list of charges against Edmondson include insurance fraud, obtaining property by false pretense, and burning personal property. All of those are felonies. Plus, the man is facing one count of making a false report to police, which is a misdemeanor. If convicted, he could be spending a long time behind bars, plus have a long probation while making steep restitution payments.</p>
<p>In each state, there’s a way to report anyone you suspect of committing insurance fraud, usually anonymously.</p>
