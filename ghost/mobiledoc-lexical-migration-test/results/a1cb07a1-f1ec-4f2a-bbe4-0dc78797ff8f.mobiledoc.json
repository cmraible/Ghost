Police say he used a blunt metal object to wreak absolute havoc in the middle of the night on April 14. A private security team which was monitoring the hardest hit dealership called police, who were able to arrest the man without incident."

Most hard their rear windows busted out and some sustained damage to the wipers, electronics, and other equipment. While some of those vehicles were brand new Hondas as well as customers’ rides, some were used Mercedes, Fords, Jaguars, Minis, etc. waiting to be sold."

Customers who were going to pick up their much-needed vehicle received a phone call informing them they would have to wait a little longer to take delivery. One of those customers had flown in the night before, likely eager to take his new ride on a road trip back home."

Police didn’t disclose what they thought would be a potential motive for such a senseless act of violence. Sometimes people just want to see the world burn, which could be what this is all about."
