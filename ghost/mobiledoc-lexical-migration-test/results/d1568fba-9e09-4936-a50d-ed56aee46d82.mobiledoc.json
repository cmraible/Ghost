Resulting contact between the two Mopars rips off the Chargerâ€™s bumper on the passenger side, leaving it hanging like a loose band-aid. The person reverses over the lawn just as a car drives down the road. We get people do weird things, but how could witnesses not think this was suspicious?"

After all, a Scat Pack isnâ€™t exactly a quiet car, plus it sounds like it mightâ€™ve crashed into trash cans or a garage door when it first pulls forward, before hitting the Jeep and making even more noise as the bumper gets mangled. Yet in the video you donâ€™t see anyone run outside, you donâ€™t hear any shouting, as if everyone in the house is passed out."
