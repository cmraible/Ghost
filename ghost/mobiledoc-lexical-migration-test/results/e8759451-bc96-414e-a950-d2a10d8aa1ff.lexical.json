On some vehicles, there’s a blade key inside the fob and a physical lock you can use to get inside, plus a way to start the engine using that old-fashion key. That’s not the case with Teslas but thanks to the expensive electric cars being connected to a data network you’re supposed to have some help. However, actor Glenn Howerton claims he had a horrible time getting into his Tesla Model X when the fob died.",
