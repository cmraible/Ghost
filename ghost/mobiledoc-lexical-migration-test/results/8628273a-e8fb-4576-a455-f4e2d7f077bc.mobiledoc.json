After all, the “normal” people treat cars like an appliance, even classic models, a thing which allows them to get from point A to point B. That’s why things like heated seats, cutting-edge sound systems, and onboard vacuum cleaners are all very important to so many car shoppers these days (that’s thick sarcasm). Anyway, the point is that maybe the non-car people are the ones denying reality."

If people actually knew the limits of cars, they’d realize that sometimes they ask too much of them, like going two years without changing the oil or never flushing the cooling system. Any mechanic can tell you all kinds of horror stories associated with the stupid things people do or don’t do with their cars, then the incredulous attitude they put on full display when met with the reality of their foolishness."
