However this 1999 AM General Hummer H1 being offered on Bring a Trailer is far from stock. As a modified open-top example, lifted and riding on 37-inch tires, it is likely way more capable than how it came from the factory. Although, it is now powered by an interesting choice of engines. The 3.9-liter Cummins 4BT turbo diesel inline-four paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and dual-range transfer case seem to be a rather lateral movement from the stock 6.5-liter but may help lighten the beastly SUT up a little. Other features of note are a set of LED spotlights, heated seats, a Momo steering wheel, a rearview camera, and a custom audio system."

At the same time, sales dropped below 300,000 units for the first time in four years which signaled trouble was ahead for the pony car. With the thought that maybe the styling was just too much, Ford scaled back on the aggressive look for the Mustang but the trend was unwavered and sales continued to drop. This paired with an overabundance of options made this model year a highly collectible one."
