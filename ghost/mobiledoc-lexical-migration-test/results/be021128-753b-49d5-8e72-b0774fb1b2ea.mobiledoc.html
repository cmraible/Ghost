<p>What's the furthest you've ever taken a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/3rd-gen-trans-am-for-300/">project car</a>? Projects are, of course, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/french-twist-1987-renault-11-turbo/">never done</a>, so it stands to reason that if you kept a project around <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/rock-or-restore-updated-swb-911/">long enough</a>, you'd eventually end up with an LMP1 car. it's sort of like that old quote about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">monkeys, typewriters, and Shakespeare</a>.</p>

<p>We aren't sold on the infinite monkey theorem, but we do have some evidence to back up our theory on project cars. YouTuber Misha Charoudin recently uploaded a video about a man named Nige.</p>
<p>If there's two things that Nige seems to love in this world, it's the Nürburgring and his Mk2 Volkswagen Golf. Over the years, Nige has gradually transformed his VW into a track weapon that can hang with Porsches and feed them their lunch on one of the most grueling, punishing tracks in the world.</p>

<p>Nige's Mk2 features a stiffened structure, a flat underside, and a cornucopia of aerodynamic accoutrements and modifications that make this Golf stick to the track like duct tape. </p>
<p>At first glance, some, if not all of these upgrades make Nige's Golf look like some high schooler's overzealous tuner car build. On the contrary, every modification has been painstakingly researched, carefully engineered, and extensively tested.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves. In the video, we can see Nige effortlessly pass far more exotic machinery with his purpose-built track weapon. The turbocharged, 16v four cylinder helps, and we're sure that all of the aero does, too. The truth is, though, that the most impressive part isn't the car – it's the driver.</p>
<p>Nige knows what he's doing behind the wheel, and he also seems to have a good understanding of car design and aerodynamics. It's a rare combination,  but that's little consolation to the Porsches that he routinely embarrasses on the Nürburgring.</p>
