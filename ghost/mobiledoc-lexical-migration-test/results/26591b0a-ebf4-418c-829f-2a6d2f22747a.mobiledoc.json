A Bowler team of engineers started with a 2010 Defender 2.4 TDCi donor vehicle and added a Bowler “Fast Road” suspension system, a Stage 2 tuned engine, and a set of 16” Beadlock wheels wrapped in 37-inch high profile Maxxis Trepador tires. A Warn Zeon-10S winch, a Safety Devices external roll cage and roof rack, LED lighting, and rear deck checker plating polished off the vehicle's villainous style."

However, the 11th example was made in 2019 for Bowler Director Richard Hayward’s personal collection. Unlike the others, this one was made right hand drive and is currently located in Chobham, UK.
