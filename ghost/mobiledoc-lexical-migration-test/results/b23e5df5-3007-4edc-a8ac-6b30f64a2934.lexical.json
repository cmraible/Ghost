However there is a growing base of fans for cars like this. Unfortunately this Corvette is a prime example of the consequences that come with neglecting a vehicle.",

However, when you look under the hood you’ll notice a pretty great looking 350 in.³ V8 engine and as you examine the interior it’s clear to see that it’s not in as terrible shape as you might expect.",

At least that’s what it always could’ve been before ending up in the boneyard. Along with it since the third gen Firebird as well which is a particularly saddening site for any American enthusiast who knows their stuff. However, there is always hope even in the case of beaten up and rusty old classics that have been abused and left to rot. It’s possible that someone will come save the car from its eventual demise and we might get a chance to look at the beautiful Corvette back on the road sometime soon.",
