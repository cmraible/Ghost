          "An on-board air compressor and air-ride seats were also fitted along with a custom interior. Under the hood is a 453 Detroit Turbo Diesel mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. In keeping with its transporter heritage, the engine features a Jake brake and the transmission features a 3-speed auxiliary. Additionally, an auxiliary fuel tank keeps the truck on the road for longer trips. It is fitted with a custom made truck bed that features a gooseneck hitch. This is a fully custom one-of-a-kind truck and it is not likely that another like it will ever be made. For more information on this stunning truck click "
