And now there’s an ideological home for that worldview: Vance has become one of the leading political avatars of an emergent populist-intellectual persuasion that tacks right on culture and left on economics. Known as national conservatism or sometimes ‘post-liberalism,’ it is — in broad strokes — heavily Catholic, definitely anti-woke, skeptical of big business, nationalist about trade and borders, and flirty with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban…. And while the movement’s philosopher-kings spend a lot of time litigating internal schisms online, the project is animated by a real-life political gambit: that as progressives weaken the Democratic Party with unpopular cultural attitudes, the right can swoop in and pick off multiracial working-class voters.”"

It isn’t reflected just in the number of occupied hospital beds, but also in the faltering resolve and thinning ranks of the people who attend those beds. ‘This just feels like one wave too many,’ [emergency physician Megan] Ranney said. The health-care system will continue to pay these costs long after COVID hospitalizations fall. Health-care workers will know, but most other people will be oblivious — until they need medical care and can’t get it.”"

As the Pacific Northwest gets warmer and drier, water is becoming a hot commodity that’s attracting investors — whether it’s the Latter-day Saints, large agricultural interests or New York investors. And while state laws across the region regulate how, when and why water rights are sold, some worry it won’t be enough to hold back the tide.”"

Asked by an interviewer, more than a decade after Roe, if she had ever had an abortion, she dismissed the question as ‘irrelevant.’ But it was not irrelevant. Her abortion, she later explained, was why she had “spent this much time” on abortion rights; it was on her mind during the hush that came over the chamber before she addressed the Supreme Court. Weddington had come to see the individual at the heart of Roe as herself, and she thus took ownership of the case — in fact, took more than she deserved.”"

Just as she described New York City as a place for ‘the very young’ in ‘Goodbye to All That,’ ‘The White Album’ and especially ‘Slouching Towards Bethlehem’ can be read as templates for young writers who also may be at a loss for what they actually want to say, but still want to say it; who want to be honest, but have only really mustered up the courage to write in the confessional style they stole from Didion.”"
