That is a crazy number considering that the new Corvettes come with about 490 from their base model. On top of that, you also have to factor in that these cars only weigh about 3,000 to 3200 lb which means that this car has a wild Power ratio which is more than capable of keeping up with newer vehicles. In fact, one of the only things a modern-day car might have an advantage in is gearbox design. Well, that would be the case if this didn't have a four-speed manual transmission and a 3.55 rear-end gear ratio.",

That means that, while the car is well out of its breaking., it doesn't have too many miles and most likely won't have many issues due to where.
