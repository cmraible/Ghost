Especially during the pandemic and then post-pandemic?\n3. I feel like people have been talking about chatbots in customer service for years now, what's the progress look like there? Where are we with that and where is that heading?\n4. How do you know it's time to sell your company? We recently had on [Andrew Gazdecki](__GHOST_URL__/get-ready-for-micro-m-a-at-scale-its-happening-now-feat-andrew-gazdecki/), founder at MicroAcquire on to discuss the same topic, would love to hear your thoughts.\n5. If an entrepreneur is selling his/her business for the first time, what negotiating tactics should they be aware of? How can they counter?\n6. What's the most important thing a pitch deck should include and where should it be included?"
