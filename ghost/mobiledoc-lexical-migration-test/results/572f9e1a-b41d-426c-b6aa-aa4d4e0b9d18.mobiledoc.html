<hr>
<p>Fans of the show <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/deans-supernatural-impala-to-head-home-with-jensen-ackles/">Supernatural</a></em> said goodbye to the long-running show in 2020. One of the mainstays of the show was the black <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-most-collectible-chevy-impalas/">Chevy Impala</a> driven by Dean, and when the show was over, the actor took the car home. However, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sorry-hellcats-this-impala-ss-gave-chase/">Impala</a> was no stranger to getting stolen or being out of commission, so other vehicles sometimes made an appearance.</p>

<p>The minivan by Dodge is hardly an old-school muscle car, but you gotta do what you gotta do to hunt evil spirits. After his Impala is in an accident, the minivan is the old vehicle to his avail, so that's what the brothers used in the episode <em>Everybody Loves A Clown</em>.</p>

<p>Dean Winchester lives in an alternate reality in <em>My Heart Will Go On</em> and drives a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">1960s Ford Mustang</a>. The car switch was a result of him saving the Titanic from sinking, which is probably very confusing to people who don't watch the show.</p>

<p>When Dean comes back from the dead, his Impala isn't at his graveside, so he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1951-mercury-2-door-coupe/">hot-wires a Mercury</a> Monterey at a gas station to get back to the business of the living, including getting his beloved car back.</p>

<p>An old school muscle car fits the show's brand, but it's a little beat up. In a season 7 episode of the show, the brothers use <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">this Mopar</a> for their hunt.</p>

<p>I ran across a meme about this one, the text said "The most disturbing thing on this entire tv show wasn't a monster or a creature. It was Dean driving a Prius." In the episode <em>It's A Terrible Life</em>, Dean's given a character overwrite as an office worker.</p>

<p>While attempting to settle into a 'normal' life, Dean put the Impala up and opted to drive an average Joe truck. The truck doesn't stick around for very long and the Chevy Impala is back on the road soon.</p>

<p>This 1977 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-trans-ams-on-motorious/">Trans Am</a> is not from a <em>Smokey and Bandi</em>t recreation but it would be an interesting crossover episode (a little too late). The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1966-pontiac-gto/">old school Pontiac</a> might challenger the Impala for the coolest car on the show.</p>
