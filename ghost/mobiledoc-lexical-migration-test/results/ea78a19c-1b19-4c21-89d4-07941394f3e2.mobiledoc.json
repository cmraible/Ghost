          ", is a second generation model having been built in 2011 and has a 6.2 liter V8 nestled under that muscular looking hood. The same engine, in fact, as the then recently unveiled ZR1 Corvette, the LS9. From the factory these bits of kit spat out 556 horsepower thanks to that roaring LSA Eaton blower. It even broke a Nurburgring lap record in 2010, so it’s pretty damn quick."
