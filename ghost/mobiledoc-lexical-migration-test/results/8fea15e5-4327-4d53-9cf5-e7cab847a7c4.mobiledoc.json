Not only that, but the music is excellent on its own merits."

While it runs great, I never once experienced a frame-rate drop while docked or in hand-held during my time with it, the game does suffer loading in an area without textures. It won’t be an entire area, however I have found that walls and some sections of grassy areas can go without the texture loading in for twenty to thirty seconds, even when I’m not doing anything. Personally, this is a preferable issue to areas loading in perfectly in exchange for massive framerate drops, however I for one wouldn’t have minded if the game took an extra five to ten seconds on a loading screen if it needed to avoid this problem. The initial loading screen can feel a little long, but all others are fairly quick, and I doubt I would have noticed if they were an extra few seconds longer to get the textures in order."
