This engine would be a challenging opponent at the drag strip, so the builder made sure it could use all of its power. This V8 sends its torque through a manual transmission, giving the driver a sturdier grip on the vehicle than with an automatic. Overall, this is the perfect car for any classic car enthusiast looking for a great mix of performance, style, and comfort.</p>
