<p>Four stories from the intersection of social media and digital journalism to see you through the day. My home lunches look <em>exactly</em> like the one in the photo. Don't yours?</p>
<h2 id="facebook-s-online-mall-announced">Facebook's online mall announced</h2>
<p>Mr Zuckerberg's big news for last night is, indeed, big. However is a very mixed piece of news. It would be churlish to deny that this is a short-term good, but it is also quite likely a long-term harm.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It's great news for small retail businesses, especially those that are in enforced shutdown and having to pivot to delivery. They will be able to get up and trading much more quickly.</li>
    <li>It's bad news for the rest of the internet ecosystem, as Facebook strengthens its chokehold, and makes Facebook a substitute for the open internet for more and more people. We should <em>all</em> be very afraid of that happening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a suggestion: take advantage of it for now, if it's helpful to helping your business — or your client's — survive the crisis. But plan for an reduction strategy, where you move those customers into a more direct relationship.</p>
<p>Facebook has proved repeatedly that it'll eventually charge you more to reach the customers you've acquired. </p>

<h2 id="covid-19-breeds-news-avoidance">Covid-19 breeds news avoidance</h2>
<p>This was predictable - I've been writing about it for two months - and, in some ways, the fact that so much of the industry seems <em>surprised</em> by this is part of the problem. </p>
<p>Just because journalists are obsessed with endless, incremental news on a subject, it doesn't mean everyone else is. </p>

<p>Related to the above, the subscription bump from the crisis seems to be flattening. I have some insight into this - I was lucky enough to edit a report looking at it, and I'll see if I can get permission to touch on some of what's happening here in a future post. </p>
