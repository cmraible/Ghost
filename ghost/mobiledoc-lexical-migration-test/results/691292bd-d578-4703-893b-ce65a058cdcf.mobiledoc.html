<p>We love the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/flared-1966-mustang-fastback/">Ford</a> GT. If the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-60th-anniversary/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> is America's Sports Car, then the Ford GT is America's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/story-of-driving-a-koenigsegg/">Supercar</a>. When you're talking about fans of the Ford GT, there's two distinct camps. </p>
<p>There are fans of the 2005-2006 Ford GT, powered by a supercharged Modular V8, who are vocal about the purity of the car and its V8 power. Fans of the new car cite its superior technological prowess and racing pedigree.</p>

<p>We say, why pick just one side? Both are fantastic. Especially in yellow with black racing stripes.</p>
<p>Apparently, some wealthy car collector out there agreed with us. As Part of <a href="https://www.mecum.com/auctions/kissimmee-2021/collections/ford-gt-double-vision/">Mecum Auctions' Kissimmee 2021 sale</a>, both variants will be crossing the block. If you choose to buy both, you'll have a matched pair (and our undying envy).</p>
<p>The 2005 GT features all four options â€“ racing stripes, painted brake calipers, BBS wheels, and premium audio courtesy of McIntosh. According to the listing, it's one of just 19 Speed Yellow Ford GTs built in 2005 with racing stripes and painted calipers.</p>
