It seems no expense was spared on this Camaro. From the custom, one-off Budnick wheels to the black with blue stitching interior, the build utilized an impressive amount of hand made, one of a kind parts; making it a truly unique vehicle. And now it could be yours!"

Naturally, some stopping power is required, and this comes in the form of Wilwood 12-inch disc brakes and four-piston Dynalite aluminum calipers in the front. There's also Corvette C4 calipers in the rear. It may be a speed demon, but the car should stop just as quickly!"
