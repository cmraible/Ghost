Plymouth only made 2,724 of these cars to celebrate the All American Racers team (founded by Carroll Shelby and Dan Gurney) that fielded a 'Cuda in the Trans-AM racing series. These are among the most iconic of all 'Cudas, and this restored example packs the 340 cubic-inch V-8 with is six-pack carburetors. Although it looks stock, this AAR 'Cuda has been slightly modified with a new rear axle and rear suspension for a lowered stance and improved handling."

This go-anywhere Ram has been customized to look like the AAR 'Cuda with a unique \"All-American Hauler\" appearance package. This includes a matching red paint job with a black hood and and cool, retro-looking strobe decals to match the 'Cuda. The Futura Tandem Axle Pro Low Loader trailer (in matching colors, no less) ensures that hauling the 'Cuda is a simple task with the ability to electrically lower the bed to make loading and unloading your payload easier. In addition to the 'Cuda, Power Wagon and Futura trailer, the Show & Tow Dream Giveaway also includes a $10,000 bonus prize from Eastwood and $45,000 to cover the taxes for this giveaway."
