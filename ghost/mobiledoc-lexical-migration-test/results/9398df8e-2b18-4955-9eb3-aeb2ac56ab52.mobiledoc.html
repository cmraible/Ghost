<p>What do you get if you combine a Ford Transit van with the engine from a Ford GT40? No, this isn’t the beginning of a stupid joke, this actually happened! Ford’s Supervans proved such a perfect tool for marketing for the company, that they built three generations of these crazy cargo carriers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqEXJocHy2w">Carfection</a>’s latest video lifts the veil on these forgotten vans that were capable of putting supercars to shame.</p>
<p>Ford has built a few punchy promotional vans over the past few years, one based on the first-generation Ford Focus RS, the other on a newer Focus ST. Interesting, quick, amusing, but a far cry from the Supervans that inspired them.</p>

<p>The Supervan story begins with Supervan 1, a vehicle that has been lost with no record of where it went. Back in its heyday, the first Supervan was effectively a Ford GT40 chassis with a Transit van shell. Instead of the rear cargo bay being full of building materials, it housed a 5.0-liter V8 engine that could get it to 150 mph. It also pinched a set of ventilated disc brakes from the GT40 to bring that performance under control.</p>
<p>Supervan 2 used a similar ‘shell on borrowed chassis’ method for its construction. A fiberglass MK2 Transit body was created and placed on top of a Group C racing chassis. A Cosworth supplied engine enabled this van to go even faster than its predecessor with a top speed now reaching 170 mph.</p>
<p>Supervan 3 was the ultimate incarnation of these mad machines. It actually wielded the same 630 hp Formula 1 Ford HB V8 engine found in Benetton racers during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Combined with slick tyres and its huge rear wing, this was a seriously fast vehicle when out on track. A Cosworth V6 engine was later fitted to Supervan 3 as it was easier to maintain than the F1 motor.</p>
