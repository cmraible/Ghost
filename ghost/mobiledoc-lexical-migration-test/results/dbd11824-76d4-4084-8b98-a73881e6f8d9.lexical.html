<p>Back in the day, the CST/10 was the top-of-the-line pickup truck offered in Chevrolet's lineup. Not only did it come with all available options, but it would also haul more than just the mail. It was a desirable truck back in 1969, and that still rings true today.</p>
<p>This beautiful example of a CST/10 was given a professional ground-up restoration in 2015. The exterior is painted in PPG Deep Atlantic Blue paint and then sprayed over with a Pearl clear. Handling is not an issue because it hugs the road with a lowered suspension with the help of power steering. Further complementing the exterior is the addition of 17-inch Billet Specialties Vintec wheels.</p>
