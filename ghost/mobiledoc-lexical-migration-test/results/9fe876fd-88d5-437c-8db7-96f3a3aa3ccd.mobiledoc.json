Under the hood is a 5-inch intake tube, which looks really out of place. It’s necessary considering Iroz threw a 73 mm turbo into the mix, which is pushing 56 pounds of boost! Of course, an engine doesn’t run on air alone, so there are huge injectors and fuel pumps. To handle all that, the engine internals have been swapped for more durable and more aggressive versions, like the connecting rods and pistons. If you’re not impressed, nothing is going to change your mind about this Audi, literally nothing."

Way more impressive is the fact the original transmission is not only still installed but completely unchanged from the factory. However, the differential and clutch aren’t garden variety. Plus, this of course is running quattro all-wheel drive."
