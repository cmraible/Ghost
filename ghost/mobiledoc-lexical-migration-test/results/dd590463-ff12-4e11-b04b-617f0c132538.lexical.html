<p>To help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Corvette" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet Corvette</a>, Advanced Automotive Technologies in Rochester Hills, Michigan created a limited-production tribute to the original C1 'Vette based on the C5 Corvette. The result is the <a href="https://www.fastlanecars.com/vehicles/2310/2002-chevrolet-corvette-commemorative-edition?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">2002 Chevrolet Corvette Commemorative Edition</a> you see here, and this one – no. 162 of 200 – is up for sale through <a href="https://www.fastlanecars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Fast Lane Classic Cars</a>.</p>

<p>The Commemorative Edition stands out with a body inspired by the 1953, which was achieved by replacing all of the factory body panels except for the doors. The front end has the signature wire-covered headlights and toothy grille of the '53, but it was done in a way to complement the C5 Corvette's swoopy front end. At the rear, the Commemorative Edition also reveals '53 cues like the tail fins and rounded trunk, and these cars even feature similar bright work as the original Corvette right down to the fake exhaust outlets built into the body work.</p>
<p>While Chevrolet produced 300 Corvettes back in 1953, only 200 of these Commemorative Edition Corvettes were ever built, and this is no. 162. This one is painted in striking Electron Blue Metallic paint job and polished five-spoke wheels, and it has been upgraded with a Corsa performance exhaust system. Under the hood, this 2002 Corvette has the 5.7-liter LS1 V8 and a six-speed manual transmission, and this engine is just barely broken in with the odometer showing just over 5,000 original miles.</p>
