This is how burnout competitions have become a popular thing both at illegal street takeover events as well as at legitimate gatherings. And as we see in the included video of a brand-new Dodge Charger Hellcat roasting rubber, sometimes those burnouts go horribly, horribly wrong."

Different drivers take their car into the burnout box, where cement barriers are supposed to keep spectators safe as they enjoy the roasted rubber goodness."

The owner is really going for it, narrowly missing the cement barriers a few times as he navigates through the burnt rubber clouds. Then, he stops the car with the rear right next to a barrier and lets the rear tires spin while keeping the Mopar muscle car stationary."

Fortunately, it looks like nobody was hurt and they were able to put out the fire in the Hellcat’s rear end. The car even drove off after a fire crew doused it to be safe. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t been damaged, although it’s hard to tell from the nighttime video."

Thankfully, the gas tank was protected from the heat and we didn’t see something far worse. Still, this should act as a warning to people who think they can do endless burnouts in a car. Even if you’re in a place where it’s legal, that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily a good idea."

At least there was no explosion of the rear tires, even though the mini explosions coming from the tailpipes are pretty cool. Plus, the driver doesn't even get close to kissing the wall in the burnout box, a tragedy we’ve seen so often but makes us cringe in horror every time."
