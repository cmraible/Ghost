<p>‘<a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/mo19/monterey/lots/r0050-1965-aston-martin-db5-bond-car/778818">The Most Famous Car in the World</a>’ is heading to auction with RM Sothebys!

<p>Perhaps the ultimate marketing relationship, James Bond and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Aston+Martin">Aston Martin</a> have walked hand-in-hand for more than half a century. The cornerstone relationship continues to this day, with speculation on 007’s new car – an electric Rapide E and/or a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/aston-martin-v8-vantage">classic V8 Vantage</a> alá <em>The Living Daylights</em> – stoking fierce interest with franchise aficionados.</p>

<p>Regardless of future exploits, the DB5 will forever remain the ultimate ‘Bond car’. As such, getting your hands on an EON-sponsored example remains a seriously rare opportunity. Don’t be surprised if the genuine Bond car sells for enough cash to hollow out a volcano. Estimates currently sit between $4 - $6 million.</p>

<p>Features on the Aston include front and rear hydraulic over-rider rams on the bumpers, a Browning .30 caliber machine gun in each fender, wheel-hub mounted tire-slashers, a raising rear bullet-proof screen, an in-dash radar tracking scope, oil, caltrop and smoke screen dispensers, revolving license plates, and a passenger-seat ejection system. <br><br>The vehicle has enjoyed the company of only three private owners from new and underwent a sympathetic restoration in 2012. As such, all 13 gadgets are in fully functioning condition. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/rm-sothebys-amelia-island-auction-kicks-off/">RM Sotheby's</a> previously sold the car back in 2006, after it had emerged from a 35-year slumber within museum walls.</p>

<p>Reaching out to the Connery family for comment from Sean before the sale, the 'original 007' stated, “These DB5’s are amazing – I remember the Furka Pass tire shredding as well as the promotional events with these cars – they have become increasingly iconic since Goldfinger & Thunderball. In fact, I bought a very fine DB5 myself relatively recently.”<br><br>If you’ve got the money, you’d be mad to miss this opportunity. The DB5 will be presented during RM Sotheby’s ‘An Evening with Aston Martin’ single-marque sale session on 15 August, 2019. The auction house will display the DB5 in North America this summer, with July dates to be announced.</p>

<p>Barney Ruprecht, Car Specialist, RM Sotheby’s explained,<strong></strong><em>“</em>No other car in history has played a more important leading role on film and in pop culture than the Aston Martin DB5." <br><br>"The DB5 is the iconic cornerstone of a marketing relationship that still exists to this day — with the model’s collectible status rooted largely in its 007 fame — and we look forward to exciting car and film enthusiasts alike in the lead up to the auction."</p>
