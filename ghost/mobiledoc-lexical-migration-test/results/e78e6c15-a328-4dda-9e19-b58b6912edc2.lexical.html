<p>Twitter has made its <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/">own analytics</a> available to all users. Key measurements are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Impressions</strong> - the number of times the tweet appeared in people’s timelines, and thus could have been read. It’s the <em>maximum </em> number of possible views - although the reality is probably lower as some people will have scrolled past without reading it.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagements</strong> - the number of actions taken on a tweet, such as clicking on a link,playing a video, retweeting it, replying to it and so on.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagement Rate</strong> - the percentage of impressions that led to an engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Impressions are typically <strong>much</strong> lower than your follower counts, due to the time-based nature of Twitter.</p>
