<p>When it comes to performance, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/caged-2013-chevrolet-camaro-zl1/">Camaro ZL1</a> is already a powerhouse off the assembly line with 580-horsepower on tap stuffed inside the 2015 model year. As car enthusiasts, the need for more power is always there. So, everyone knows that things are serious when <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-tuned-c8-corvette-205-mph/">Hennessey Performance</a> is attached to the name. <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/inventory/dealer/Adrenalin+Motors+Syvan+Lake">Adrenalin Motors</a> is excited to offer the opportunity to own this beastly <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/195061/2015-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-hennessey-with-707hp-to-the-wheels">2015 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Hennessey</a> full of potent power.</p>

<p>Plenty of people <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/el-camino-rendering/">love the El Camino</a>. In fact, there are so many that saying the car-truck has a cult following probably wouldn’t be accurate. It’s more like a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/youll-never-see-a-1971-chevy-el-camino-customized-like-this-again/">mob following</a> and it’s understandable why. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/be-cool-and-buy-this-show-stopping-1959-chevy-el-camino/">There’s a lot to love about the Chevy</a>. However, this particular one has something extra that makes it an undeniably attractive <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tyler-hoover-sings-praises-for-restomods/">restomod</a>: an LS6 from a Corvette ZO6.</p>

<p>If you were to argue that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/buy-this-rare-1962-mg-mga-mk-ii-roadster/">British</a> made some of the most entertaining, stylish, and performance-oriented <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1932-bugatti-type-55-super-sport-roadster-to-auction-for-big-money/">roadsters</a> in the 1950s, you would definitely be able to defend that position. That’s what made cars like this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/bid-on-this-1956-austin-healey-100m-bn2-roadster/">Austin-Healey</a> 3000 Mark I BN7 so enjoyable for drivers in America who wanted <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-sunbeam-tiger-auction/">something which they could push through turns on open country roads</a>, yet not spend a fortune to buy or maintain. Today, these British roadsters are much harder to come by, especially in such <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/immaculate-1964-jaguar-e-type-series-i-available-now/">immaculate condition</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone knows by now <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2010-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-hides-tasteful-mods/">C6 Corvettes</a> are solid all-around performers with good output, smooth power delivery, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lotus/">solid road/track dynamics</a>. That means most people would take this 2001 C6 at least fairly seriously, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1972-ford-torino/">but not seriously enough</a> since they don’t know about the Magnacharger supercharger bolted up to the LS1.</p>

<p>The Jeep Cherokee XJ has been a go-to choice among off-road enthusiasts since 1984, and these iconic SUVs have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years. One probable reason for this is how easy these SUVs are to modify, and that can be seen in this <a href="https://inventory.davisautosports.com/vehicles/336/1998-jeep-cherokee-stage-2-rebuild?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1998 Jeep Cherokee</a> work in progress being built by <a href="http://davisautosports.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Davis Autosports</a>.</p>

<p>The 1970 Chevelle SS454 LS6 might be one of the most highly coveted examples of this muscle car ever made, but if you're looking for a rare Chevelle, check this one out.

<p>The Pantera, meaning "panther" in Italian, is a mid-engine sports car with a twenty-year production run from 1971 to 1993. Built by Italian automaker De Tomaso, the 7,000 examples were produced in a little over two decades. Here we have a highly desired first-year <a href="http://www.luckyoldcar.com/uncategorized/lot-621-1971-detomaso-pantera/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 De Tomaso Pantera</a> (Lot 153) scheduled to cross the auction block through <a href="http://www.luckyoldcar.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Lucky Collector Car Auctions</a> and their <a href="http://www.luckyoldcar.com/2020-spring-classic/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2020 Spring Classic (online only)</a>.</p>

<p>Even with its inherent weaknesses, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-camaro-runs-out-of-road-in-australia/">modern Chevy Camaro</a> is still a solid if not exceptional <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a>. People might debate that, but it’s especially true after NicKey Performance gets its hands on one, doing what it’s done best for decades: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hendrick-camaro/">making it even better</a>.
