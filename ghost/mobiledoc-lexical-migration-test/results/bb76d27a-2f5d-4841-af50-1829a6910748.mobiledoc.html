<p>As we previously announced, tonight at 3/24 at 7 pm ET (4 pm PT), <em>The Lever </em>is kicking off its new monthly happy hour series, where supporting subscribers will get to chat with our reporters and editors about anything and everything. David Sirota, <em>The Lever</em>’s founder and editor in chief, will lead the chat from Los Angeles, where he is attending the Academy Awards as an Oscar nominee for <em>Don’t Look Up</em>.</p>
<p>These happy hours will occur every month, allowing our supporting subscribers to interact in real-time with our staff about news of the day and to help us plan our future coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Like all our live chats, these Happy Hours are exclusively for supporting subscribers of </strong><em><strong>The Lever</strong></em><strong>, who get to watch the chat live, interact with our staff, and watch a replay after the event.</strong></p>
