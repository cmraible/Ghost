          "The Commemorative Edition stands out with a body inspired by the 1953, which was achieved by replacing all of the factory body panels except for the doors. The front end has the signature wire-covered headlights and toothy grille of the '53, but it was done in a way to complement the C5 Corvette's swoopy front end. At the rear, the Commemorative Edition also reveals '53 cues like the tail fins and rounded trunk, and these cars even feature similar bright work as the original Corvette right down to the fake exhaust outlets built into the body work."
