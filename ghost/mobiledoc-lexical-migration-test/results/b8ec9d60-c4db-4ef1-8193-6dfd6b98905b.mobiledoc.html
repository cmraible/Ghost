<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-classic-corvettes/">Chevy's Corvette</a> has been at the top of GM’s line up since its debut in 1953, as America’s answer to the Euro-sport competitors of the time. Having been paraded as the pinnacle of American performance and recently as America’s new super-car. For as long as the Corvette has been around, however, there has always been one thing missing.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modified-2020-c8-corvette/">The C8 Corvette</a> is Chevy’s solution to that missing piece, that's right the corvette is now mid-engine. Its new mid-engine design features a 6.2-liter LT2 V8 pushing out a monstrous 495-horsepower, but that's not the craziest part! That 6.2L V8 is centered in between the axles for maximum stability and weight distribution making this car a handling machine. If that still wasn't enough for you it’s also mated to an 8-speed Tremec M1L dual-clutch to ensure perfect shift times and a beautiful driving experience.</p>
<p>These cars have an MSRP that is currently sitting at $59,995, just barely missing the $60k mark and showing the world that you can have an incredible super-car for an incredibly low price. The corvette has always been the car of young enthusiast dreams across the generations. The space-ship like visuals give a sleek tone to the whole car making for a fast looking machine.</p>
<p>The reason for that aerodynamic design is that this car is built for function over aesthetic, unlike most cars of a similar price point that rely on “sex appeal” (or just banking on their customer's stupidity) this car doesn't care what it looks like and that's why it is beautiful. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-chevrolet-corvette-instant-collectible/">The C8 corvette</a> takes styling cues from fighter jets because they quote “are usually high performance…” and that is the message that GM was looking to send to the world. This entire car is a letter from America to all of those snobby Italian supercars that reads “Bring it on!”</p>
