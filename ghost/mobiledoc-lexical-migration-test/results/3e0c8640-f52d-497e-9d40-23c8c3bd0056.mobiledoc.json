Well, he’s at it again, this time giving us a good look at a salvage yard that’s getting ready to crush a bunch of classic GM cars along with a few Fords and Mopars and plenty of parts."

A lot of these cars have been crashed, they’re missing an engine and probably a whole lot more, but at this point they’re such classics the effort would be well worth your time."

Also sitting in the yard is a Mustang, Thunderbird, and a Ranchero. Really, the Tri-Fives, Impalas, and Novas make up the majority of what’s left. All of these cars and the parts will be crushed by mid-summer, so hurry if you want to rescue them before it’s too late."
