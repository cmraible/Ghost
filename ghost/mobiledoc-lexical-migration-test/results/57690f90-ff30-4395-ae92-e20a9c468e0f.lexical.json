On the one hand, some people argue the police should pull out all the stops to catch criminals, particularly those who have committed violent offenses. But others point out that sometimes high-speed pursuits result in innocent people getting hurt. Ultimately, law enforcement professionals have to exercise judgment about when to chase and when to not, which was exactly how police in Sacramento were able to catch a street racing Corvette.",
