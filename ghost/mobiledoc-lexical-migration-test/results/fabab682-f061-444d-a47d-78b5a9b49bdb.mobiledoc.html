<p>On Tuesday, the <em>New York Times</em> published a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/us/politics/biden-tax-increases.html">puff piece</a> about how former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, has become “the smiling face of a well-financed effort to defeat a proposed tax increase that is crucial to funding the $3.5 trillion social spending bill at the heart of President Biden’s agenda.” The tax loophole Heitkamp is defending allows wealthy heirs to inherit investment assets without paying any capital gains taxes. The <em>Times </em>quoted Heitkamp saying her new job is “very consistent with my concern about revitalizing the Democratic Party in rural America.”</p>
<p>Left unsaid in the story? Heitkamp’s connections to a shadowy new dark money group that wants to keep the tax loophole — and the very surprising things Heitkamp had to say about that loophole just a few months ago, before she became the smiling face of the effort to defend it.</p>

<p>“The next 20 years will be a period of deep uncertainty and tremendous risk, no matter what. We don’t get to choose what challenges we’ll face, but we do get to decide how we face them.” — Roy Scranton, author of <em>Learning to Die in the Anthropocene</em> and <em>We’re Doomed. Now What?,</em> in a January 2021 <em>New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/opinion/new-normal-climate-catastrophes.html">op-ed</a>.</p>

<p>A new CBS/YouGov poll found that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ahead-labor-day-71-percent-americans-support-federal-minimum-wage-hike-poll-1626252">7 in 10</a> Americans support raising the minimum wage. The poll was released Sunday ahead of Labor Day. It found that 85 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans favor a wage hike.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> published a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/us/politics/biden-tax-increases.html">puff piece</a> on Tuesday about former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp’s new role steering a dark money group seeking to protect a tax loophole she only months ago described as “one of the biggest scams in the history of forever” — and left literally all of that context out.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> described Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, as “the smiling face of a well-financed effort to defeat a proposed tax increase that is crucial to funding the $3.5 trillion social spending bill at the heart of President Biden’s agenda.” The tax loophole Heitkamp is defending allows wealthy heirs to inherit investment assets without paying any capital gains taxes.</p>
<p>The paper wrote that Heitkamp “is adamant that taxation upon death, regardless of wealth, is deadly politics.” They further quoted her as saying her new job is “very consistent with my concern about revitalizing the Democratic Party in rural America.”</p>
<p>Unmentioned in the piece: Heitkamp is working for Saving America’s Family Enterprises (SAFE), a new dark money group incorporated in Delaware. It’s not clear at all who’s funding the group, or how “well-funded” they are. SAFE has released a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ4AbiAtKuPkEh89tixUZMA">videos</a> on YouTube, but good luck finding any television, radio, or digital ad buys. So far, their campaign has primarily centered around putting Heitkamp in front of friendly reporters and business TV talking heads.</p>
<p>The <em>Times </em>noted that Heitkamp has “counseled” her former colleagues to keep the tax loophole by using a threat, telling them to “understand there will be risk, and risk is the entire agenda.” She is not registered to lobby.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Worse still, the <em>Times</em> article neglected to mention that in April, Heitkamp specifically slammed the tax loophole she’s now being paid to defend. "This is one of the biggest scams in the history of forever on income redistribution," Heitkamp <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/building-back-america/infrastructure-summer-heidi-heitkamps-lobbying-journey/">said</a>, responding to former New Jersey Gov. Christie (R). "If you have a stock, you can pass it on to your kids with stepped-up basis, and it's never taxed. You know that there needs to be reform on unearned income. And so to demonize it and say it's going to hurt the little guy, yes, that just is not factual, Chris. And you know it."</p>
<p>In 2019, Heitkamp <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/14/medicare-for-all-opponents-one-country-project/">helped launch</a> a rural-focused advocacy, the One Country Project, with the help of the bipartisan lobbying firm Forbes Tate Partners, where her former chief of staff is now a partner. Lobbying records show Forbes Tate recently <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/cb0bc5c0-4436-4c78-b7ca-8d2d1b831ec7/print/">registered</a> to lobby for SAFE.</p>
<p>Heitkamp told the <em>Times</em> she was recruited to the effort by former Rep. John Breaux, D-La., who’s a director at the lobbying firm Crossroads Strategies. Lobbying records list SAFE’s address as the same office on Crossroads Strategies’ <a href="https://www.crshq.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p>On September 8, 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/09/10/493427601/hillary-clintons-basket-of-deplorables-in-full-context-of-this-ugly-campaign">made</a> her infamous “basket of deplorables” remark about Donald Trump supporters while speaking at an upscale New York fundraiser with Barbara Streisand. The remarks drew immediate backlash and became a rallying cry for conservatives, who used it to reinforce the narrative that Clinton was a liberal elitist.</p>

The newly elected progressives passed a Community Benefits Agreement to ensure that contracts given out by the school board created union jobs. That prompted the opposition to file a series of ethics complaints, in an effort to remove them from office.</li>
    <li><strong><strong>MANCHIN PRIVATELY WARNS HE’LL KILL INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE: </strong></strong>Joe Manchin has privately told the White House that he’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchin-backs-as-little-as-1-trillion-of-bidens-35-trillion-plan-91d079e0-84a7-4f8f-94d4-212827a61339.html">only open</a> to supporting $1 trillion of the president’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure package that includes things like Medicare expansion. At most, the West Virginia senator says he's open to supporting $1.5 trillion. Should he follow through, Manchin’s threat could sink the whole infrastructure push, as congressional progressives <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/07/28/progressives-threaten-to-torpedo-infrastructure-deal-after-sinema-comes-out-against-35-trillion-spending-bill/">have promised to vote down</a> the Senate’s bipartisan, $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill unless the Senate also passes the $3.5 trillion package from Democrats. If that happens, it will leave the Biden administration having passed no major legislation so far outside of his American Rescue Plan.</li>

Following the outbreak, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern implemented a nationwide lockdown. The country is now <a href="https://www.axios.com/new-zealand-to-lift-covid-lockdown-outside-auckland-afc0bd60-de71-40c3-84dd-ee01fc674e5e.html">lifting the lockdown</a> outside of Auckland.

The study found that warming oceans have depleted the whales’ primary food source, fatty crustaceans. As a result, the whales have been moving into waters where they collide with human vessels and fishing gear, which have been deadly. In the past decade, the whale population has declined by 26 percent.</li>
