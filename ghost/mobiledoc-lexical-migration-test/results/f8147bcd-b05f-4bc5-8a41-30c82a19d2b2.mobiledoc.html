<p>• <strong><a href="https://prospect.org/health/biden-would-rather-build-an-entirely-new-welfare-state-than-/">Biden Would Rather Build A New Welfare State Than Touch Hospitals</a></strong> (American Prospect) — <em>“One can only conclude that Biden doesn’t want to take on the power of the hospitals, drug companies, and doctors right now. The one major health care provision in Biden’s proposal is among the least popular, with the narrowest set of beneficiaries. The sole thing that makes it stand out is that the health care industry loves it. The subsidies go directly to private health insurance companies, so that more people can afford care at hospitals and other providers, and prescription drugs. To the industry, it is purely more money and customers for them with no downside.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161900/austerity-hurricane-katrina-economic-inequality-adolph-reed?utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=EB_TNR&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1619500264">How Austerity Destroyed the Public Good</a></strong> (New Republic) — <em>“The yearlong-and-counting Covid catastrophe bears similarly painful witness to the entirely predictable results of four decades’ worth of leaders blatantly and cynically discrediting government while also hollowing out the country’s social and physical infrastructure—very much including the anemic public health systems that prolonged and worsened the pandemic’s course. Democrats have unfortunately abetted the exile of public goods from respectable political discourse.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-mark-walter-is-buying-up-crested-butte-colorado-and-locals-are-freaked">Billionaire Is Buying Up Small Colorado Town—and Locals Are Freaked</a></strong> (Daily Beast) — <em>“The mountain hamlet of Crested Butte, Colorado, covers less than a square mile and, at an elevation of nearly 9,000 feet, it is taller than it is wide. So when a Chicago-based billionaire began quietly buying up its historic buildings, residents took note.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/15/oil-firm-ceos-pay-is-an-incentive-to-resist-climate-action-study-finds">Oil Firm Bosses’ Pay ‘Incentivizes Them To Undermine Climate Action’</a></strong> (The Guardian) — <em>“Lucrative pay and share options have created an incentive for oil company executives to resist climate action, according to a study that casts doubt on recent net-zero commitments by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp">BP</a> and Shell. Compensation packages for CEOs, often in excess of $10 million, are linked to continued extraction of fossil fuels, exploration of new fields and the promotion of strong market demand through advertising, lobbying and government subsidies.”</em></p>
<p>• <strong><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/29/covid-vaccine-factory-production-ip/">Factory Owners Around The World Stand Ready To Manufacture COVID Vaccines</a></strong> (The Intercept) — <em>“The drug industry has strenuously argued that any legal proposal to allow the sharing of intellectual property and creation of generic coronavirus vaccines is pointless because there are no facilities around the world that can be tapped…Except it is exactly like that. Factory owners around the globe, from Bangladesh to Canada, have said they stand ready to retrofit facilities and move forward with vaccine production if given the chance.”</em></p>

<p><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></p>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This past year hasn’t been easy for anyone (other than billionaires), and the mental health implications of pandemic quarantine cannot be overstated. As someone who has struggled with anxiety for years, I can tell you this year has been particularly challenging.</p>
<p>The mix of isolation and concern for loved ones has been a lot to process. And in that isolation, I’ve found it more difficult than ever to ignore the increasingly intense social media vitriol that has become an occupational hazard in this line of work.</p>
<p>Of late, though, I’ve found some solace in remembering that none of us are alone in this. I was reminded of that most recently by a great podcast that I’ve been listening to called <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/death-at-the-wing/id1558869948">Death At The Wing</a></em>. In particular, this <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/5-ricky-berry-and-the-pressures-of-fame/id1558869948?i=1000518010759">episode</a> offers an extremely powerful reminder that we must take mental health seriously.</p>
<p>Working to launch <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been a kind of therapy for me — not just because it embodies values I believe in, but also because I think we are building connection and community with our readers. Your feedback, comments, emails, and participation at live events sustains our work — and sustains my own hope that we can actually make a better world.</p>
<p>I’m so looking forward to a time after the pandemic when we can be with each other again. (And I’m hopeful we can actually do some <em>Daily Poster</em> live events in person in cities around the country!) But in the meantime, I appreciate all of your continued engagement and support, which helps break those feelings of isolation. I hope you are getting a similar feeling of connection thanks to us and with your fellow <em>Daily Poster</em> readers.</p>
<p>Thanks for being part of our team and our community. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. Stay tuned for some big news about <em>The Daily Poster’s </em>operations and expansion this week. Can’t wait to share it with you!</p>
