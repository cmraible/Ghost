Every now and then, though, they come up with something truly impressive.</h3>

<p>This gorgeous gold <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4757/1968-buick-skylark-gs400-convertible-tribute?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1968 Buick Skylark convertible</a> has been restored into a tribute to the awesome GS400, one of the most formidable muscle cars of its day. The "GS" stood for "Gran Sport," while the second half of the name is a reference to the engine's 400 cubic inch displacement.</p>

<p>That <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4757/1968-buick-skylark-gs400-convertible-tribute?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">big V8</a>, fed by a four-barrel carburetor, is rated at 340 horsepower and 400 lb/ft of torque. An optional Stage 1 package bumped up power to 350 horsepower. </p>
<p>Most muscle car fans agree that these numbers were underrated from the factory to keep insurance premiums low. <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4757/1968-buick-skylark-gs400-convertible-tribute?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Understated performance</a> was very much on-brand for Buick, though.</p>
<p>While Cadillac was all about opulent, ostentatious luxury, Buick was more subdued all around. With a few notable exceptions, even <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4757/1968-buick-skylark-gs400-convertible-tribute?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">their muscle cars</a> flew under the radar visually.</p>

<p>Aside from the subtle badging and striping, a few fake scoops are all that separates <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4757/1968-buick-skylark-gs400-convertible-tribute?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a Gran Sport</a> from a standard Skylark. It should be noted that that hood scoop was functional if ordered with the Ram Air package, and would be functional as standard beginning the following model year.</p>
<p>While this may not be a real, numbers-matching GS400, it offers the experience and the aesthetic, accurately reproduced for what we imagine will be <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4757/1968-buick-skylark-gs400-convertible-tribute?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a far more reasonable price</a> once the hammer falls and bidding is over.</p>
