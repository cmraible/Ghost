<p>The very first <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/artist-new-ford-bronco/">2021 Ford Bronco</a> First Edition 2-door <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1966-shelby-427-cobra-super-snake/">crossed the block</a> at the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barrett-jackson-scottsdale-fall/">Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale</a> auction <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/barrett-jackson-pushes-january-auction-back/">over the weekend</a>, netting $1.1 million. As one of the charity auction vehicles, it is one of only 7,000 First Edition Broncos to be made. Plus, it bears VIN 001 and will undoubtedly be a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/a-super-collectible-mustang/">highly sought-after collectible</a> in the future.</p>

<p>Wearing an exclusive Lightning Blue paint job over a Dark Space Gray/Navy Pier interior, the combination makes the Bronco First Edition look excellent, no doubt something Ford though long and hard about.</p>
<p>Since it’s a First Edition model, this Bronco features mechanical components from the Badlands series and luxurious appointments of the Outer Banks Series, plus the Sasquatch package. The result is a highly-optioned off-roader designed to impress and excel on the trail.</p>
<p>The auction price of this Ford Bronco will be donated to the National Forest Foundation and Outward Bound. The purpose of the National Forest Foundation is to get people invested in the public enjoyment and health of national forests. As for Outward Bound, its aim is to prepare students with “strength of character and determination” necessary for success in life.</p>
<p>As you might already know, the new Ford Bronco boasts all kinds of removable features, including the roof and doors, making it a direct rival for the Jeep Wrangler. This particular one comes with the 2.7-liter V6 engine, which puts 310-horsepower on tap. Front and rear locking differentials, trail-turn assist, and an electronic stabilizer bar disconnect are some of the trail-ready features Ford hopes will help steal sales away from the Jeep brand.</p>
<p>With a design clearly connected to the classic Broncos, Ford hopes its return to the off-roading world will bring in extra revenue and help the brand win over more enthusiasts. After several delays, the new Bronco finally launches this year.</p>
