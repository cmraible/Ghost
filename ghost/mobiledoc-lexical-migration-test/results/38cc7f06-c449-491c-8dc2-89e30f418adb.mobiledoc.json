          "One of the most famous innovations of the great Parnelli Jones came behind the back of co-driver Bill Stroppe. Secretly sharing his design with Stroppe mechanic Dick Russell, the pair began building a Bronco that would go on to change Baja racing forever. Initially upset by the deception of his team sneaking around behind his back, Bill Stroppe quickly saw the extreme potential in Jones’ designs and jumped on board. This decision would lead them to victories in 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1974."

Its design began with a tubular chrome moly space frame and implemented aluminum and fiberglass bodywork for an incredible amount of weight savings. Under the hood, a Windsor 351-cid engine produces a whopping 390-horsepower that it pushes through a modified C6 B&M hydro transmission. Two 22-gallon fuel cells allowed the racer to drive longer with less fuel stops and built in thermos jugs kept the team hydrated through the grueling race."

This incredible feat happened due to the GT-R's nearly 600-horsepower engine and dual clutch transmission, a full NISMO tuned suspension, and a creative use of carbon fiber to reduce weight and create downforce. Since the model year that set the record lap, Nissan and NISMO have been working to further the design each year, improving handling and acceleration capabilities. This 2018 Nissan R35 GT-R NISMO is a prime example of the GT-R’s recent advancements."
