And while it endured a lot of heat for flooding roads with countless Prius drivers, that technology has matured to the point where there’s a hybrid version of just about every Toyota model line at this point (the Tundra, Sequoia, Land Cruiser, 4Runner, and Tacoma being the exceptions for now). That doesn’t mean Toyota is above criticism or scrutiny, but accusing the automaker of being against technological progress is hardly fair.
