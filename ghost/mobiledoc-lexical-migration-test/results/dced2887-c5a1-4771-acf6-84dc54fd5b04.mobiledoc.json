I’m surprised how much I’ve missed being able to look at my wrist and see the time, rather than having to get my phone out.\n2. The health-tracking circles interface is *really* good: it’s a very powerful visual motivator to exercise a bit more, just from glancing at your watch. Liking that a lot.\n3. The only 3rd party app I’ve used extensively over the past 24 hours is [Dark Sky](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dark-sky-weather-radar-hyperlocal/id517329357?mt=8&uo=6&at=11lLfX&ct=). That app was conceptually built for the watch, truly.\n4. The Watch is **NOT** an iPhone on your wrist. The sooner you get your head round that idea (and it took me a few hours), the sooner you’ll start exploring what it actually is.\n5. That sapphire screen on the Watch? Beautiful. This is actually an item of jewellery as much as it is a piece of technology. I’m enjoying having it on my wrist, even when the screen if off (which it is the majority of the time.)\n6. I’ve been up since 6.40am, and I’m on 83% battery at 3.25pm.\n\nI’m on toddler duty, so I haven’t had that much time to really play yet. More to come as I do.\n\n\n## Unboxing the Apple Watch\n\nMost of the unboxings I’ve seen have been of Apple Watch Sport. The Apple Watch comes in a rather different box:\n\n![Apple Watch in its packaging](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/watch-in-box.jpg?resize=800%2C600 \"watch-in-box.jpg\")\n\nIt’s a square box in a square box. And it’s all as lovely, and finely crafted as you would expect. All the parts fit together perfectly, and slide apart smoothly.\n\n![Apple Watch packaging](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/watch-packaging.jpg?resize=800%2C600 \"watch-packaging.jpg\")\n\nThe box has the contents clearly printed on the size, so the watch/band combos clearly have their own boxes. Has Apple ever had this many SKUs of a single product before?\n\n![Opening the Apple Watch box](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/apple-watch-box-open.jpg?resize=798%2C449 \"apple-watch-box-open.jpg\")\n\nThe inner box pops open to reveal… a third box. It’s like pass the parcel.\n\n![The actual Apple Watch box](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/watch-box.jpg?resize=799%2C626 \"watch-box.jpg\")\n\nTwo tabs allow you to pull out the actual Watch box. (The power cable and brief documentation are sat underneath this. Incidentally, this is the first Apple product I can remember that *doesn’t* come with Apple logo stickers.)\n\nThe actually box itself reminds me of the plastic shell of the old-fashioned white iBook/MacBook. I really wouldn’t be surprised if it was an identical plastic. It’s a really substantial box – something that’s clearly designed to be kept and used, not just chucked away.\n\nPop it open:\n\n![The Apple Watch in its box](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/watch-in-its-box.jpg?resize=798%2C449 \"watch-in-its-box.jpg\")\n\nAnd there’s the Watch.\n\nAll in all, it is clearly a *crafted* opening experience, designed to convince you that by stepping up to Apple Watch rather than Apple Watch Sport, you’ve bought a better quality product. And it’s compellingly tactile, too.\n\nPity the next step was rather ruined by it taking me a fair while to figure out how to actually turn Watch on…\n\n\n## Apple Watch in use\n\nOnce I’d done that, and spent a while syncing it with my phone, this is how it looks on the wrist:\n\n![Apple Watch in use](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/Apple-Watch-in-use.jpg?resize=800%2C800 \"Apple-Watch-in-use.jpg\")\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n"
