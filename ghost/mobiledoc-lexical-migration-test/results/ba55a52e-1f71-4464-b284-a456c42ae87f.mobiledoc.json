This has caused automakers to completely shut down production lines at factories in the United States and elsewhere, as well as decrease the volume of certain models they assemble. Some automakers are even taking out features which use chips, replacing them with analog replacements to conserve their supply. This has also had an impact on car parts, making acquiring some components next to impossible. Predictably, we’re seeing a rise in cost for new vehicles and replacement parts, putting anyone who has a need for either in a financial bind."
