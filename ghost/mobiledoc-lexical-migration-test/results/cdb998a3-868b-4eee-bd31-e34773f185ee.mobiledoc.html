<p>“Finds like this in original condition, stored with care in a clean and dry outbuilding, don’t come along often. According to the sellers, Peter’s son and daughter, all the cars represent family togetherness, high days, holidays and happy memories,” said Bargain Hunt and Antiques Roadshow star Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons Auctioneer.</p>
<p>"Even though it went to Scotland, it was carefully garaged away while they were there. The family took two cars on the trips north. Dad drove the Jag while the sellers’ mum followed in the family Mini.</p>
<p>"Its garage-mate was the Bullnose Morris which has had three owners from new. It was sold by G H Robbins of Evesham in 1922 and registered in July that year. Mr Robbins bought it back in 1939 and kept it until he passed away in the 1960s. In 1963 it was purchased by Peter.</p>
