That’s a 61-horsepower and 37 lb.-ft. boost over the 991 Turbo S. With the new turbos 14 percent larger and boasting variable-turbine geometry plus electrically-adjustable wastegates, improved forced induction is partly why."

That meaty stance comes from a 42 mm increase in front track width and a 10 mm increase for the rear. Staggered tires, with 20-inch tires in the front and 21-inch tires in the rear, are a first for the car. Porsche says these changes aren’t just for aesthetics, which it certainly helps, but also tightens up handling. Just like before, all-wheel drive is standard, although it can send more torque than before to the front wheels when necessary."

Among the additions are controlled cooling air flaps up front. It’s not your imagination: Porsche made the rear wing larger, so it applies even more downforce. A redesign has changed the looks and performance of the pneumatically-extendable front spoiler."
