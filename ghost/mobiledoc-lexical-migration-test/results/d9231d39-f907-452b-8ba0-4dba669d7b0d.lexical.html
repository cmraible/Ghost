<h3 id="even-among-ferraris-this-one-is-a-standout">Even among Ferraris, this one is a standout.</h3>
<p>A rare opportunity has emerged as this <a href="https://www.thebarnmiami.com/vehicles/241/2015-ferrari-458-speciale-aperta?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale Aperta</a> has become available. The most powerful Ferrari Spider built when it debuted, this supercar understandably made huge waves worldwide. It boasts a bevy of track-focused upgrades pushing it beyond the capabilities of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ferrari/458%20Italia" rel="nofollow">Ferrari 458 Italia</a>, an impressive machine in its own rite. Combine that with the fact that only 499 458 Speciale Apertas were built, ensuring you’re not going to see one of these too often.</p>

<p>Such a special <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">car</a> obviously has a special powertrain. A 4.5-liter V8 sits midship, providing excellent balance for superior handling. It produces a peak 597-horsepower at a howling 9000 rpm, thanks in part to a more free-flowing exhaust and carbon-fiber intake manifold.</p>
<p>This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ferrari" rel="nofollow">Ferrari</a> is sincerely a track car which is legal to drive on public roads. That’s obvious when you study the active aerodynamics. For example, the front bumper contains flaps on either side of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/3600-mile-carbureted-ferrari-512-bb/" rel="nofollow">Ferrari</a> badge, but those flaps only open once the car is going faster that 106 mph. There’s another flap below those which pushes open at 138 mph, improving handling as the car rockets down track straightaways.</p>
<p>While a Rosso Corsa Ferrari is what everyone expects, this 458 Speciale Aperta subverts expectations with its attractive and different blue exterior and gray striping. This pairs exceptionally well with the gray interior, which is quite luxurious for a track-focused car.</p>
<p>Everything about this 2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale Aperta looks immaculate. There’s building speculation that this model will skyrocket in value even more, thanks in part to its inspiring design and performance, as well as the low production numbers. Already prices have doubled, so the future looks good for ownership. In the meantime, you get to enjoy one of the finest to have rolled out of Maranello in modern times.
