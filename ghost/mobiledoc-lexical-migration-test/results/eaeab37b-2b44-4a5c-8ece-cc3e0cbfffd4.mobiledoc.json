We’re not sure if any of those reasons are behind this creation customfncustoms showed off on Facebook recently. The California shop has teamed up with Abimelec Design to completely transform a BMW E46 by putting a 1965 Ford Mustang body on the chassis and attaching a Dodge Challenger Hellcat front. It’s one way to anger BMW, Ford, and Mopar purists all at the same time."

Considerable work has been done to ensure the transition between the Hellcat front and the Mustang body is seamless. With big fender flares and smaller wheels than you’d probably expect to see on a modern American muscle car, this ride looks a little off, especially if you stare at it for too long."

In other words, you could make any car look kind of like a Tron vehicle, which we must admit is pretty cool, even if we know some people will abuse that in the most retina-scorching ways imaginable. It’s being touted as a solution for increasing visibility for motorcyclists, cyclists, and others at night, which is a great idea."
