<hr>
<p>Specialty Vehicle Engineering is getting everyone excited for the upcoming release of its newest super muscle car. In a video posted to Facebook, which we’ve embedded in this article, SVE shows off a 2022 Stage II Yenko Camaro doing a dyno test. The result is an astonishing 1100-horsepower, a figure which has the exact effect SVE wanted to achieve.</p>
<blockquote><em>Remember the disastrous flight of the Lincoln jet car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/lincoln-jet-car-jump/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>In case you’re not aware, that’s a 50-hp bump over what SVE offers with the 2021 Stage II Yenko Camaro. It’s good to see they’re not just sitting on their laurels, getting overly comfortable with the fact they’re pushing over 1000-hp because that would be tempting to do.</p>
<p>There isn’t much in the way of information about the 2022 Stage II Yenko Camaro at the moment. For example, we have no idea what peak torque output is or what changes made it possible to squeeze out the extra 50-hp.</p>
<p>For those unfortunate enough to live in states which follow the heavy-handed “advice” of CARB, SVE has also recently revealed a California Edition Yenko Camaro. It’s a way to have some fun while remaining emissions compliant, at least until tailpipe emissions are outlawed. Sadly, that compliance comes at a price since output is a measly 750-hp. Yay for “progress.”</p>
<p>At WOT the 2022 Stage II Yenko Camaro sounds brutal. However, sitting in a closed room like that tends to make any engine sound more abrasive to the ears. How this thing sounds out in the open is yet to be determined, but it’s probably a safe bet to say it’ll get the blood pumping. For now, if you’re at work or somewhere you don’t want to disturb others, put on your headphones and enjoy the noise. Otherwise, crank up those speakers and bask in the glory.</p>
