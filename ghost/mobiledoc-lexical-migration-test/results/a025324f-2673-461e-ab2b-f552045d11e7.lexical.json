I thought about canceling, but consulted with friends and decided to follow through with it. He was incredibly sweet and down-to-earth and we really connected. I told him I’m a staunch anti-capitalist up front. He told me he’s a capitalist, and we agreed to disagree on that point. We’ve been having a great time!",
