<p>It is slightly bizarre to think that, by the time I press publish on this post, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/25/business/elon-musk-twitter">Elon Musk might own Twitter</a>. I‚Äôm not going to join the legion of people claiming they will quit Twitter if that happens. I‚Äôve been on the platform for over 15 years, and have seen plenty of drama come and go. I'll stick around with some popcorn, and watch him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/22/twitter-tony-wang-free-speech">repeat the mistakes of the past</a>.</p>

<p>But there will be some consequential risk for those of us who embed tweets in articles, like I just did right above this paragraph, if others do both quit AND delete their accounts.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-of-embedding">The rules of embedding</h3>
<p>The rules have always been pretty simple: you should, wherever possible, use tweet embeds rather than screenshots of tweets. Of course, you should keep a screenshot of the tweet if you think there‚Äôs a serious risk of the originator deleting their tweet, and it‚Äôs a critical part of the story. </p>
<p>The exception is, of course, outlets who tend to attract enough opprobrium that people will change their usernames to obscenities, if they find that they‚Äôve been embedded in an article on, oh, say, <em>MailOnline</em>. They go straight to the screenshot to minimise that risk.</p>
<p>However, for the rest of us, the screenshots weren‚Äôt strictly necessary, as the embeds gracefully fell back into blockquotes. So, this:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <div>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>However, as <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/twittereditsyou.html">noted by Kevin Marks earlier this month</a>, this recently changed. For a while, an embedded tweet that‚Äôs been deleted looked like this:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/whiteblog.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1111" height="582" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/whiteblog.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/whiteblog.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/whiteblog.png 1111w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>That‚Äôs a significant regression in the usefulness of embeds in journalism. The words you‚Äôre quoting are no longer available to the reader. They might well still be in the source of the page, but the javascript at work is obscuring them. You could go in and edit the embed source HTML to create the older quote effect demonstrated above ‚Äî but that's slightly technical and presupposes that you're aware the tweet is gone. </p>
<p>In effect, those publications who have done the right thing ‚Äî embedding ‚Äî rather than the wrong thing ‚Äî screenshooting ‚Äî looked like they were being penalised for it.</p>

<p>Kevin was able to winkle an explanation out of Twitter:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Kevin! We're doing this to better respect when people have chosen to delete their Tweets.

<p>And yes, that does make sense. But it also had the effect of breaking all sorts of news stories, not least the ridiculously large number of articles from the late 2010s based on the tweets of one now-ex-president Donald J Trump. However much you might despise the man, there‚Äôs no doubt that his tweeting was part of the historical record of the era, and that‚Äôs now getting ever harder to access.</p>
<p>However, thankfully, for the time being, Twitter has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/9/23018126/twitter-reverts-change-left-blank-spaces-websites-embedded-tweets">reverted to the old behaviour</a>: </p>
<blockquote>‚ÄúAfter considering the feedback we heard, we‚Äôre rolling back this change for now while we explore different options,‚Äù Twitter spokesperson Remi Duh√© said in an emailed statement to <em>The Verge</em>. ‚ÄúWe appreciate those who shared their points of view ‚Äî your feedback helps us make Twitter better.‚Äù</blockquote>
<p>They're still exploring ‚Äúdifferent options‚Äù, though, and they're rolling back the change ‚Äúfor now‚Äù, so change is probably still coming (Musk allowing). And this is a sobering reminder that, when you embed something on your site, you lose control of that element of your page.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-we-do">So, what do we do?</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs worth considering changing your house style to quoting Tweets rather than embedding them. So, in effect, you treat something on Twitter like anything else you want to quote from the web: use the text in the body of your article, in inverted commas or in a blockquote, and then link to the original source.</p>
<p>So, for example, I could take Kate‚Äôs tweet:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <div>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">comment pages are just endlessly bloody recycling the current outrages.

        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And just render it thus:</p>
<blockquote>comment pages are just endlessly bloody recycling the current outrages. "My hot take on why yesterday's bad thing is bad."</blockquote>
<p>‚Äî <a href="https://twitter.com/katebevan/status/1518606519306272773?s=21&t=cbN_IQgWulC-mvAdQIiISg">Kate Bevan on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>That's all on my server, so if Kate does choose to delete her tweet, my story still makes sense, whatever Twitter decides to do. </p>
<p>If it‚Äôs anything mildly controversial, I‚Äôd also keep a backup screenshot, just in case it was needed as evidence of the original tweet. But with a tweet like the above, no need.</p>
<h2 id="the-risk-of-embeds">The risk of embeds</h2>
<p>Embedding content in your site is always risky, especially when it‚Äôs critical to the story. You are, in effect, extruding a bit of that platform into your site. And with that extrusion comes the risk of the content changing in ways beyond your control, as well as allowing little elements of the tracking that these platforms use onto your pages.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to be quoting more and embedding less here in future. Yes, that does mean I‚Äôll have to put a little more effort into breaking up text into readable chunks, and generally making my pages look pretty. The quick visual hit of a pretty embed is something I'm going to be less trusting off in future. But the trade-off for that is content whose future I control, faster page loads times and less tracking of you, dear reader.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time to consider if that‚Äôs the right approach for you and your site, too.</p>
