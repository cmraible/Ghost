With a current bid of $17,300 at the time this article was written, you might think it could be a good deal. After all, this thing has a 396 paired up with a Muncie M22 4-speed and a 12-bolt rear. But not everyone is going to agree if this is something you should snatch up or if you should keep fishing."

You can draw your own conclusions about why that might be. The seller claims this ride has been sitting in a shop in south Texas for the last 10 years, so that’s a bonus if you’re worried about corrosion."
