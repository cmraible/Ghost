<p><em>Live blog of Jeremiah Owyang, Chief Catalyst & Founder, Crowd Companies at LeWeb 2013</em></p>
<p>We’ve moving on from the democratisation of media – social media – to people using these same tools to get what they want in the physical world. It’s the collaborative age. Six months ago, in London, <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&tag=leweblondon13&limit=20">LeWeb focused on the sharing economy</a>. People are empowered to get the physical world from each other.</p>
<p>Things have accelerated in that six months. HP is <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/11/26/whitman-hp-will-enter-3d-printing-but-not-via-acquisition/">joining the 3D printing market</a>. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/google-ventures-puts-258m-into-uber-its-largest-deal-ever/">Uber raised $258m from Google</a>. The faster these things change, the harder it is for big companies to adapt. The lifespan of big companies is decreasing – this is why.</p>
<p>Corporations need to make the crowd part of the company. <a href="http://www.quirky.com/ge">GE partners with Quirky</a> to enable crowd innovation. You can <a href="https://www.uhaulinvestorsclub.com/HowItWorks">crowdfund a U-Haul truck</a>, through U-Notes. Why does the company do it? It creates a shared fate. If they invest in you, they’ll buy from you. It’s the highest form of loyalty.</p>
<p>A community of makers called <a href="http://blog.custommade.com/about/custommade/">Custom Made</a> will create jewellery for you to match your (high-end) car.</p>
<h2 id="1seekpurposefulprofit">1. Seek Purposeful Profit</h2>
<p>Corporations in the US are bound by law to maximise shareholder profit. Senior executives see profit as the main objective of a business. Millennials say it’s societal development.</p>
<p>Toyota has the 100 Cars for Good programme, which gives cars to non-profits. Toms – a shoe company – launched a marketplace where they sell other people’s products. Brands are launching marketplaces for social good, rather than just selling their won products.</p>
<h2 id="2maximisingresources">2. Maximising Resources</h2>
<p>B&Q launched Streetclub – which enables local community sharing. Trunk Club is an internet stylist on demand. Four men style you a trunk of clothes based on your style and your measurements, and you chose to keep what you like – and then pay for it, all from the luxury of your own home. Marriott is offering Workspring – workplaces on demand.</p>
<h2 id="3harnesscrowdinnovation">3. Harness Crowd Innovation</h2>
<p>Companies are struggling to find new ideas internally. 78% of companies are now focusing on looking to the outside world for their ideas. The success rates are wildly variable – but the desire is there. Nordstrom is using Etsy as a wholesale buyer. Nokia released plans for its phone cases as 3D printer files. You can design and print your own phone cases.</p>
<p>So, how do you be resilient as a big company? Collaborate with the outside world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crowdcompanies.com">Crowd Companies</a> is a trade council to allow big corporations to come together and learn from experts and each other about this. There’s a (hand=picked) innovation network of startups who will get to pitch to them for free. Here’s Jeremiah’s <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2013/12/10/introducing-crowd-companies-a-brand-council-for-the-collaborative-economy/">post announcing the new company</a>.</p>
