That brother-in-law passed away recently, but for almost four decades the car he loved sat in Reggie’s garage with clutter covering it up. Unfortunately, without the title in hand the family is having a difficult time transferring ownership legally to the son."

The appraiser couldn’t certify that the car was a genuine Shelby, only that it came from a Ford factory. Also, the door tag doesn’t match the car, so it was probably a replacement door from a Dearborn-built coupe instead of a San Jose-built fastback."

          "People were excited about the Shelby Mustangs, in part because Carroll Shelby had proven himself to be one of the best around. After all, the Cobras were legendary on the road and track, plus Shelby was able to turn Ford’s fortunes in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Trans-Am series provided proof that the Shelby-built Mustangs were also the real deal, so winning races translated to strong demand for the hopped-up pony cars."
