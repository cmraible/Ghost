<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being April 26, Nintendo’s fiscal year just ended and that means news and results. But most importantly, Nintendo has a new president!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo’s New President</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1718" src="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-New-President-2.png?resize=623%2C576" alt="Nintendo New President" width="623" height="576" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-New-President-2.png?w=623&ssl=1 623w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-New-President-2.png?resize=300%2C277&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, Tatsumi Kimishima has officially stepped down as CEO of Nintendo and 46 year old Shuntaro Furukawa. Furukawa was a board member for both Nintendo Japan and The Pokémon Company for many years and knows the ins and outs of both companies very well. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satoru Shibata Stepping Down</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1719" src="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=900%2C506" alt="Satoru Shibata" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Satoru-Shibata.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you don’t know who Satoru Shibata is, he was the president of Nintendo Europe and appeared in many European versions of the Nintendo Directs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this doesn’t mean that he’s leaving Nintendo. In fact, he is being recalled back to Nintendo Japan to be a board member and director. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo Switch Online Reconfirmed for September</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo has reconfirmed the new Switch online program for September 2018 but did not say anything else on the matter. One can assume that they’re waiting to reveal all the details at E3 or in its own Direct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo also didn’t say anything about Super Smash Bros. other than it is still planned to release this year, but I’m still a firm believer that it’ll release alongside the Online program.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo’s Mobile Plans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the announcement of Mario Kart Tour? Well, That’s still on track to release within Nintendo’s new fiscal year (April 26, 2018 – March, 2019). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nintendo also stated that there will be more than just Mario Kart Tour on mobile, so keep an eye out for more announcements there.</span></p>
