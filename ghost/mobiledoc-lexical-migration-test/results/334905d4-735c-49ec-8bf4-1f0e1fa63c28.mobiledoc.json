Still no word on titles such as Super Smash Bros., Animal Crossing, Pokémon and Metroid Prime 4 but we can imagine that they’re keeping those announcements for bigger events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also got some surprises that we weren’t expecting, like the new Mario Tennis game and The World Ends With You.
