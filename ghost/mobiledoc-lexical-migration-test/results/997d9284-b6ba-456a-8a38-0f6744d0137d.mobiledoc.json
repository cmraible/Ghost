However, if you do go street racing, don’t then make an insurance claim when you inevitably crash. That’s exactly what Michael Lynn Cooper, 55, of Ontario, California is accused of doing and the man’s now facing multiple felony counts of insurance fraud and grand theft."

His insurance policy specifically doesn’t cover damage from incidents while street racing, and Cooper told police he wasn’t racing but was just driving down the road. That means he’s also facing charges for giving false statements to a peace officer and street racing. Cooper has been booked into jail and has remained there since October 28."
