<hr>
<p>2020 has been a wild ride, so we decided to do our part to end it on a positive note. On December 31st, the Motorious crew will deliberate and pick a winner of the <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/">2020 Motorious Online Car Show</a>. As soon as our decision has been made, we will announce it on our Facebook page, and contact the winner. Once the winner has been contacted, they will be given the details on collecting their prize, and we will post a full feature on the winning vehicle. </p>
<p>Don't forget, the winner isn't just chosen by us, the People's Choice winner is still very much up in the air, with plenty of time to rally votes, but new enteries will need to catch up quick. </p>
<p>Motoroius Digital Concours is a virtual car show. At the end of the judging period (once we have reached 500 submissions), a guest judge will pick a Grand Prize Winner! The Grand Prize Winner will receive $1,000 cash, bragging rights and a front-and-center feature spot for the next contest.</p>
<p>6 Additional winners will also be chosen, one for each of the 6 Hobby Segments (Classics & Vintage, American Muscle, Hotrods, Sports & Exotics, Trucks & Offroad, and Imports & Tuners.)</p>
<p>1 People's Choice Champion will also be crowned based on whoever has the most user votes. So view current <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries">entries</a> and vote for your favorite. You can vote for as many cars as you would like but only one vote per car.</p>
<p>Just know, you can only enter one hobby segment per contest. All winners will be contacted and requested to provide proof of ownership upon selection. By entering this contest, you agree to be a subscriber to Motorious updates and emails.</p>
<p>If you've got a car you're proud of, go ahead, find your category, and <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/#enter-to-win">submit it</a> for your chance to win some awesome prizes!</p>
