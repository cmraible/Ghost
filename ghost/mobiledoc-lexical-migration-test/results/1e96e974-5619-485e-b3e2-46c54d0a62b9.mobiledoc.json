Also, a lot of collectables are locked behind doors but the items needed to unlock them are usually so close by that it felt more like an afterthought rather than deliberate game design. There is one level in the later half of the game where you have to search an underwater maze for a whole chain of items to open up a cage at the beginning of the level. This level stands out way more than the rest because it’s the only one that goes against this trend."
