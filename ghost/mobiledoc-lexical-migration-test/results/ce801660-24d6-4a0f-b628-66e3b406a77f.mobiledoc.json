          " is one of the most apparent 1:1 PC ports I’ve ever played and at points, it’s just tragic. This is essentially a point and click adventure game that works fine when you’re moving from one destination to another, but when you need to pick up one of the many small items necessary to progress or when you’re looking for clues, the translation from mouse to joystick is painful. It’s so clunky and clumsy that it stops what fun there is to be had in its tracks, especially when you’re running from an enemy and have to frantically search for a door knob to click on and open the door. The discrepancy between the precision required to succeed and the precision of the controls is so wide that pushing through this game for more than a half hour at a time is a struggle. "

There are essentially two kinds of enemies: supernatural beings of immense power and the delightfully-terrifying design of the high school janitor. The first time you have a janitor chase you, it is genuinely intense, but after they introduce the more nightmarish characters, all that tension evaporates. This wouldn’t be a bad thing if the game didn’t still expect you to find the janitors threatening. They’re plentiful and annoying, an unnecessary mechanic. Imagine playing an RPG that has you fight monstrous dragon bosses, but all the overworld enemies are kittens. The supernatural designs and situations are so well done and unnerving that the janitors are all the more disappointing. "
