<p>Good things are happening! Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and Oregon flipped off party leaders and their super PAC donors by choosing anti-establishment progressives over corporate Democrats in this week‚Äôs primaries. Also, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is giving states more power to hunt down bad actors, unionization efforts nationwide are flourishing, and the Biden admin green-lit another round of free at-home COVID tests.</p>

<p>Much to the chagrin of corporate Democrats and their super PAC donors, progressives in Pennsylvania and Oregon miraculously eked out wins in Tuesday‚Äôs primaries. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania state Rep. Summer Lee, an anti-fracking progressive running in the 12th congressional district, won in Tuesday‚Äôs Democratic primary against former Republican U.S. Senate staffer and <a href="https://paydayreport.com/pgh-congressional-candidate-steve-irwin-led-law-firms-union-avoidance-division/">union-avoidance lawyer</a> Steve Irwin. Lee‚Äôs win in fracking country came as a pleasant surprise, especially given the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/05/16/pennsylvania-summer-lee-steve-irwin-israel-aipac/">more than $3.4 million</a> that outside groups tied to pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) poured into the race. <br></p>

<p>‚ÄúOur victory shows that we can overcome the billionaire class that wants to divide and conquer us all with fear and lies-for-profit, if only we come together across our differences for a positive vision of multiracial democracy,‚Äù Lee <a href="https://twitter.com/SummerForPA/status/1526930416221016065?t=kc2EGXf9fDlUQH3ZDpc-Nw&s=19">tweeted</a>. ‚ÄúWe can have nice things, if we fight.‚Äù</p>
<p>Also in Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, whose campaign survived attacks from a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-corporate-threat-in-dems-must-win-senate-race/">health insurance-aligned super PAC</a>, beat conservative Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb in the Senate primary. Fetterman‚Äôs victory came despite Lamb receiving the establishment‚Äôs support and Fetterman having surgery to implant a pacemaker on Election Day following a stroke he had last Friday. Fetterman has voiced his support for a host of progessive priorities, from universal health care to recreational marijuana legalization. It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that Fetterman supports fracking and that he intends, if elected this November, to <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/john-fetterman-says-hell-lean-in-on-u-s-israel-relationship-as-senator/">help bolster</a> the cozy relationship between the U.S. and Israel.</p>
<p>In Oregon, Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Biden- and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/follow-the-pharma-money/">Big Pharma-backed</a> Dem representing the state‚Äôs 5th congressional district, is likely to lose his seat to progressive challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner, once Clackamas County‚Äôs ballots have <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2022/05/19/in-state-elections-complaint-mcleod-skinner-campaign-alleges-unequal-access-to-clackamas-county-vote-count/">all been counted</a>. Results should be in by next week.</p>
<p>Also in Oregon, state Rep. Andrea Salinas, who was backed by the Working Families Party and other national and local progressive groups, won her congressional primary against Carrick Flynn in district 6 ‚Äî a stunning upset, given the <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2022/05/17/crypto-backed-oregon-congressional-candidate-lost-to-andrea-salinas-despite-13-million-in-backing/">$13 million</a> in super PAC spending for Flynn. If Salinas wins in November‚Äôs general election, she will be the first Latina representing Oregon in Congress. </p>
<p>The progressive candidates‚Äô success follows new polling data showing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dem-voters-flip-off-party-leaders-and-their-big-donors/">Democratic voters are disgruntled</a> with their party‚Äôs incrementalism.</p>
<h3 id="a-win-for-consumers">A Win For Consumers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the agency charged with protecting Americans from bad actors in the financial sector, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-bolsters-enforcement-efforts-by-states/">announced a rule</a> making clear that state regulators and attorneys general can go after companies and individuals that violate federal consumer financial protection laws ‚Äî such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which protects information collected by consumer reporting agencies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the years leading up to the financial crisis, federal regulators undermined states seeking to protect families and businesses from abuses in the mortgage market,‚Äù said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. ‚ÄúOur action today demonstrates our commitment to promoting state enforcement, not suffocating it.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="state-of-the-unions">State Of The Unions</h3>
<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†On Thursday, there were union victories at <a href="https://twitter.com/CMRJB/status/1527408592529281025?t=MwRcoyDsl8eZuI0dUcAx5g&s=19">three Starbucks</a> locations in Colorado; one at a Starbucks in Waban, Massachusetts; and one in Newport News, Virginia. In total, <a href="https://twitter.com/greenhousenyt/status/1527440816909737997?t=F9mgBTmr87aranydZz4G7A&s=19">more than 80</a> Starbucks stores have been unionized.

<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†The National Labor Relations Board told Amazon Labor Union ‚Äî the nascent group responsible for the Staten Island Amazon warehouse win last month ‚Äî that it plans to bring <a href="https://twitter.com/greenhousenyt/status/1527454394459082755?t=GGH6ntcWhV5z7-Af_f_C3A&s=19">a new complaint against Amazon</a> for additional <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/amazon-threatened-workers-over-union-vote-labor-officials-find">labor law violations</a>. Those potential violations include the company allegedly holding illegal captive audience meetings, telling employees who signed union authorization cards that they would give up their right to speak for themselves, and threatening to withhold benefits from employees, among other illegal activity.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†Journalists at <em>The Hill</em> are seeking to unionize and <a href="https://twitter.com/budrykzack/status/1526919836055527426?s=21&t=8FgbWY640e7nJRec9MxOvg">just requested</a> voluntary recognition of The Hill Guild from Nexstar Media. </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†On Thursday, Amherst Cinema Workers United <a href="https://twitter.com/ACWorkersUnited/status/1527362284367949851?t=dVT470GRIkuXFd_kpA01Lw&s=19">received</a> notice of voluntary recognition.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†Labor reporter Alex Press wrote a <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/05/labor-unions-nlrb-starbucks-target-trader-joes">great piece</a> on budding unionization efforts across the retail sector, including at Apple, REI, and Target.</p>

<p>The Biden admin opened another round of free home COVID-19 tests that folks can order <a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits">here</a>. Each order includes eight rapid antigen tests, and shipping is free.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Biden also <a href="https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1527046436004700161">announced</a> that his administration will invoke the Defense Production Act to accelerate baby formula production. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajeansu/status/1527049203838590976?t=tkq6N48RmQqRbmtajCVTdg&s=19">if only</a> he could use the DPA to help the solve other crises, like our destructive fossil fuel dependence or a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/where-is-biden-in-the-global-war-on-omicron/">lack of COVID vaccines</a> in many countries around the world. </p>

<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†The Tops supermarket in Buffalo, where the devastating shooting by a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cheat-sheet-five-things-to-know-about-white-supremacist-terror/">white supremacist</a> occurred last weekend, is a crucial source of groceries and community resources. Because of the <a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieMac/status/1525875352697978880?t=RQOHFx6W74vC7KOPgKt4dA&s=19">physical and emotional toll</a> the mass shooting has taken on members of the predominantly Black neighborhood in which it occurred, it‚Äôs worth contributing to the Buffalo Community Fridge, if able. Their Venmo handle is @bflocommunityfridge. ¬†</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ¬†In light of the <em>Washington Post </em>editorial board <a href="__GHOST_URL__/mccarthy-era-law-aimed-at-pro-choice-protesters/">demanding the arrests</a> of protesters peacefully demonstrating outside Supreme Court justices‚Äô homes based on the leaked draft opinion to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, media watchdog group FAIR is asking people to let the <em>Post</em> know that ‚Äúrepression of peaceful assembly is incompatible with democracy.‚Äù You can find more information <a href="https://fair.org/home/action-alert-wapo-calls-peaceful-protest-against-roe-reversal-totalitarian/">here</a>. </p>
