<p>An oil crisis is bad news for automotive business as the shortage of fuel means that a car isn’t much use to anyone. This became a real issue in the 1970s with the masses looking for means of personal transport that could be run on a shoestring. Enter the microcar, or more specifically the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/66650/1980-freeway-3-wheeler">Freeway 3-Wheeler</a>.</p>
<p>The UK had the Peel P50, and Germany the BMW Isetta, but America’s answer to needing to be frugal was this fascinating Freeway. This single-cylinder 3-Wheeler was manufactured by High Mileage Vehicles and claimed 10 - 100mpg. The microcar’s engine is placed directly behind the driver with a CVT transmission providing drive to the single rear wheel. There’s no reverse gear, so turning around in a tight space requires a small amount of manual labor.</p>

<p>While born out of necessity, the Freeway’s shape is pretty futuristic thanks to its aerodynamic nature — from some angles it could even pass as an ancestor to Volkswagen’s XL1. Its body was made from fibreglass in order to keep weight to a minimum, as was the car’s drag reducing undertray.</p>
<p>The interior seats one occupant with a small storage area for personal effects. A simple dashboard features a series of buttons for functioning things such as the lights and wiper, but also hosts functioning radio.</p>

<p>This bright yellow example is currently for sale with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/66650/1980-freeway-3-wheeler">Classic Auto Mall</a> and represents a good opportunity to add a real curiosity to your collection.  The 1980 model is either powered by a 12hp or 16hp engine — apparently there are no identifying marks — and could do with a mechanical tune-up. However, one of the biggest draws of this Freeway is its low mileage, clocking just 6133 miles from new.</p>
<p>Only 700 of these microcars were built between 1979 and 1982 when High Mileage Vehicles closed. We think that this retro eco-car is quite the character, and certainly a machine that will have people raising an eyebrow.</p>
