However, the ’69 Camaro started having so many problems it no longer worked as the guy’s primary transportation. Then it was the fun weekend car, but eventually the repairs were too costly for him to run at all. He parked it, probably thinking he would get it running again in the near future, but with some unforeseen financial challenges the opportunity never presented itself. Criticize him if you must, we’re just glad the car has been rescued before anything really bad happened to it."
