This, combined with the reliability that is ever present in any inline-six design, is mostly to blame for how much abuse the 2JZ is able to withstand, but the best way to understand exactly how Toyota designed the 2JZ to be so bulletproof is to dig into one."

Adding rigidity to the block while still allowing access to the rotating assembly, Toyota bolted a girdle to the underside of the 2JZ. Finally, a forged crankshaft, wide bearing design, and plenty of thrust bearing, make the rotating assembly nearly indestructible. The success that so many in the tuner community have had with this engine is really not surprising at all."
