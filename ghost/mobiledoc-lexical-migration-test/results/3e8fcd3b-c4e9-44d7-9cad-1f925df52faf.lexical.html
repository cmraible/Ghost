<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>I paid over two times what I‚Äôve ever paid for a vehicle mostly because I saw buying an electric vehicle (EV) as step one in cutting the fossil fuel cord in my life. (Next will be rooftop solar and swapping propane HVAC and water heating for electrically powered heat pump-based appliances.)</p>
<p>I had cord cutting as a goal well before actually purchasing the EV; I put a deposit down three years earlier. But there‚Äôs a different feeling after actually buying and driving an EV. It‚Äôs a vastly superior driving and owning experience from every perspective. Rather than feeling like I sacrificed, I feel like I improved my life and how I feel about everyone, everywhere, replacing fossil fuels.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt convince Chevron to stop buying politicians, but I can stop sending them my money. The impact of my individual action in terms of addressing climate change rounds to zero, but how I think about addressing climate change is now grounded in a powerful personal experience that makes me believe getting the world off fossil fuels is as certain as the knowledge I‚Äôll never again buy a gas-powered vehicle. That seems likely the sentiment of 99 percent of the 6.75 million EV owners as of March 2022. It‚Äôs hard to believe the environmental impact of all those EVs still rounds to zero.</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm wondering: To what extent does buying an EV move the needle in terms of sparking other fossil-fuel replacing activities?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Personally Transcending Fossil Fuels (PTFF for short)</p>
<p><strong>Dear PTFF,</strong></p>
<p>I was tempted to edit this (somewhat lengthy) question down, but decided not to because I think you‚Äôve started to answer that question yourself.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll put my cards on the table and say that, as someone who has never had a driver‚Äôs license ‚Äî for boring and entirely non-political reasons ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have much context for what (I gather) is the smooth hum of an electric engine. I‚Äôll trust you on that, PTFF. But what you‚Äôre getting at here has lessons beyond the relative emissions-cutting benefits of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Those looking to tell a positive story about the world that ambitious climate policy can build have mostly, until recently, had to tell a story about the future. But there‚Äôs no substitute for getting a taste of that yourself. A long holiday weekend is a glimpse of what a world with a four-day work week might feel like. Using an efficient metro system to breeze around a dense, pleasant city loaded with parks and other public amenities is a better sales pitch for ditching car culture and suburban sprawl than the best communications strategist could muster. If people can experience aspects of a lower-carbon world themselves, they may well be open to fighting for more of them.</p>

<p>On the specifics, I‚Äôm skeptical that electric vehicles are quite the panacea for the planet that members of the Biden administration have made them out to be. There are many more drawbacks with cars than the fact that they run on fossil fuels, and electric vehicle supply chains have their own problems. As political scientist Thea Riofrancos <a href="https://logicmag.io/nature/what-green-costs/">has detailed</a>, the scale of critical minerals that a one-for-one substitution of internal combustion engines for EVs would entail is a powerful argument for expanding mass transit, from e-bikes to buses to cars.</p>
<p>Not wanting to continue getting caught in endless traffic jams is another reason to be circumspect about EVs. The hulking electric tanks U.S. automakers seem keen to build are a wasteful, unnecessary danger to bikers, pedestrians, and just about anyone else forced to share a road with them.</p>
<p>Mass transit takes time to build, though. And the transportation sector needs to be decarbonized as quickly as possible. Transportation accounts for <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/potential-role-and-impact-evs-us-decarbonization-strategies/">28 percent</a> of U.S. emissions ‚Äî the largest of any sector ‚Äî and light-duty vehicles (i.e. the cars most people drive around) make up roughly 60 percent of that.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll need a lot of EVs, which currently make up a tiny percentage of the U.S. car fleet. We should hope that Congress passes policies that make them easier to get, and run off a grid that isn‚Äôt powered by coal and methane. EVs‚Äô contribution to decarbonization depends <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change/">heavily</a> on where they get their power from, even if they have dramatically lower emissions over the course of their lifetime than oil and gas powered cars.</p>
<p>Like just about everything in the awe-inspiring planning challenge that is deep decarbonization, electric vehicles are necessary but not sufficient. If driving one convinces someone that a lower carbon world can be a more fun one, that‚Äôs probably a good thing. There are plenty of other ways to do that, too.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>A little while back, I was hitting it off with a guy I had matched with on a dating app. We chatted for a while and had plans to get dinner, but a few days before the date I went to look at his Twitter: He liked a post by Jeff Bezos and another by Elon Musk. I thought about canceling, but consulted with friends and decided to follow through with it. He was incredibly sweet and down-to-earth and we really connected. I told him I‚Äôm a staunch anti-capitalist up front. He told me he‚Äôs a capitalist, and we agreed to disagree on that point. We‚Äôve been having a great time!</p>
<p>My question: Do we think it‚Äôs okay to be staunchly anti-capitalist and be sick of dating or hooking up with mean intellectual men on the left ‚Äî and okay with sweet, caring capitalists?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Political And Polysecure</p>
<p><strong>Dear Political And Polysecure‚Ä¶</strong></p><!--members-only-->
<p>The fact that someone has been inundated by capitalist ideology doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre a bad person ‚Äî propaganda works, and it‚Äôs hegemonic! The anti-capitalist left, unfortunately, is not at all hegemonic. And false consciousness doesn‚Äôt really address the issue, or provide an answer to your quandary.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe class which has the means of material production at its disposal,‚Äù as Marx wrote in <em>The German Ideology</em>, ‚Äúhas control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it.‚Äù As are the ideas of most members of the dating pool.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people who wholeheartedly believe that capitalism is the best possible system for producing and distributing society‚Äôs vast resources based on whatever personal journey they‚Äôve been on thus far in life. Lots of those people are also probably kind, hot, and good in bed. And there‚Äôs no shortage of insufferable slobs on the left. The correlation between someone sharing your politics and being fun to hang out with is infuriatingly weak.</p>
<p>In a way, these are two sides of the same coin: If you wouldn‚Äôt go on a date with someone primarily for their views on capitalism, then don‚Äôt <em>not </em>go on a date with them for the same reason. Like New York in the summer, dating is a confusing, sometimes noxious stew, and there‚Äôs a lot of trash everywhere. But you can have a lot of fun and find something really special, too.</p>
<p>Part of the joy (dare I say) of dating apps is getting to transcend your own social networks and flirt/date/hook up beyond what ‚Äî especially on the left ‚Äî can be frustratingly small, borderline incestuous social circles. Ultimately it‚Äôs up to you, though: If you can‚Äôt have a good time hanging out with someone because of how they feel about billionaire space jaunts or cryptocurrency, then don‚Äôt hang out with them. If you think you can ‚Äî <em>and you actually like them </em>‚Äî then give it a shot. To answer your question: Yes, it‚Äôs okay.</p>
<p>The other relevant question is what you‚Äôre looking for. If you‚Äôre in the market (sorry) to casually sleep with someone, the stakes are pretty low ‚Äî enjoy yourself! If you‚Äôre looking for marriage, kids, etc., then maybe you‚Äôd want some stronger foundation of shared values.</p>
<p>If there‚Äôs a genuine connection, maybe you can develop those shared values over time, even short of something serious and long-term. As strange as it is for you to be seeing a low-key billionaire fanboy, it‚Äôs probably just as foreign for them to get a glimpse into your world and view on things. Maybe they‚Äôve never been to a protest, taken a door-knocking shift, or gone to parties where people get drunk and talk about one-on-ones and Franz Fanon. Maybe they‚Äôll like it, maybe they won‚Äôt! But chances are it‚Äôll be new and it might take them a little time and handholding to adjust.</p>

<p>What I‚Äôd humbly advise <em>against</em>, though, is treating someone with different politics as an organizing project. That is, you should probably stop seeing someone if the main reason you‚Äôre doing so is to bring them over to your side. Spend your time and energy elsewhere! There are, as they say, plenty of less politically objectionable fish in the sea ‚Äî and on Tinder, Grindr, Hinge, Feeld, etc.</p>
<p>As my experience of being on the apps before and after Bernie Sanders‚Äôs 2016 presidential primary campaign can (anecdotally) attest, the work of trying to build a hegemonic left project will yield a more amenable dating pool along the way.</p>
