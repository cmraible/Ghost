<p><strong>Developed By</strong> Hermes Interactive<br><strong>Published By</strong> Team17<br><strong>Rating</strong> E<br><strong>Players</strong> 1<br>Automachef is a puzzle simulator game that has you working alongside a not so subtle robot who is bent on world (fast food) domination. But running a fast food restaurant is hard work, which is why you need to automate the process by programming machines to do the job. Place these machines in the correct order whilst using as little energy and ingredients as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Developed By</strong> Hempuli<br><strong>Published By</strong> Hempuli<br><strong>Rating</strong> E<br><strong>Players</strong> 1<br>Baba Is You is a grid-based 2D puzzle game developed by Arvi “Hempuli” Teikari as an expansion of his award-winning entry in the 2017 Nordic Game Jam. Manoeuvre text tiles around to form different sentences that inherently change the rules of the game (it’s hard to hard… watch the trailer). With an ingenious central premise free of unnecessary aesthetic fluff, this is a dense, challenging game that can rely on the quality of its own design to keep the player invested.</p>

The challenge, however, comes in needing to end the level with the same colour as the border, which becomes quite challenging as the game progresses.

Not bad…</p>

<p>Now yes, Breath of the Wild is commonly seen as an action/adventure game, but the Legend of Zelda series is also widely renowned for its puzzles. There are a total of 120 shrines that contain physics-based puzzles and over 900 Korok Seeds to collect by solving small tasks (or lifting a rock). Couple all that with a sprawling open world and 97 on Metacritic making this one a no-brainer.</p>
