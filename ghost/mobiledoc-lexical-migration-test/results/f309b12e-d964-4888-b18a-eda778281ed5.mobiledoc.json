The Duesenberg brothers had innovated hydraulic brakes for motorsports and outfitted this car with them, something which became an industry standard later. That aluminum body was made by Bender and this car came to be known as the “Castle Duesenberg.” The family kept it for almost a century, finally donating it to the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum late last year."

It matters what cars are added since those provide that kind of representation. The Register has only been around since 2014, which is pretty shocking because other historical objects have been preserved for some time."
