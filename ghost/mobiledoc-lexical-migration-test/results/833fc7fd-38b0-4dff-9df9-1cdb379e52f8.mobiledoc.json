The masterpiece was completed by 1959 and went on to win the Los Angeles Arena show in the early 60s.

The car was restored about 25 years ago in such a way that prompted a response from the king of customs himself. \"Whoever restored the car looks like he did a nice job,” said Barris of the restoration."
