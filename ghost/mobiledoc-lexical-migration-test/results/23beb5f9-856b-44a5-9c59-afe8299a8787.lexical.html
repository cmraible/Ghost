<p><a href="https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/117">Kai Branch</a> on the reason he still publishes a magazine in the digital age:</p>
<blockquote>Take newsletters for example: I believe we’re currently in the volatile phase of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a> where everyone – startups, publishers, VCs – is trying to get a slice of the pie. I find this gold rush mentality and the FOMO that comes with it pretty exhausting – even just as a bystander.<br>The print world serves as a kind of refuge from that feeding frenzy. In a field where success usually means ‘breaking even’, I think what motivates print publishers most is the belief that they have something meaningful to contribute to their chosen niche.</blockquote>
<p>I have, increasingly, taken to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/09/subscribed-three-essential-magazines/">reading print magazines again</a> for exactly that reason — including Kai's own excellent magazine, <a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com"><em>Offscreen</em></a>.</p>
<p>Which print magazines do you still love?</p>
