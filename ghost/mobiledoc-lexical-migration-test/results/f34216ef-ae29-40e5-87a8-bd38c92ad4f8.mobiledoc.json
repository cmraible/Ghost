If you think the rich and famous are immune from this crime spree, you might be wrong. After all, movie star Owen Wilson had the wheels stolen right off his Tesla as it was parked in front of his house in Santa Monica on May 28."

Police told the local Fox affiliate there were no witnesses. They’re checking home security camera footage to see if maybe there are images of the thieves captured."

Honestly, that sounds on the low end for a Tesla, so we question if that’s not just the cost of the wheels without the tires. Even if it’s three times that, for Owen Wilson that kind of money should be chump change."

Considering how many people have their cars stolen, which are worth more than Owen’s wheels and tires, and the cops just take a report and that’s about it, maybe there still is something to celebrity privilege, especially in Southern California?"
