The automotive press was primed to just lavish the Cadillac Blackwings with unquestioning praise before any details about them were released, which always makes me suspicious. Sure, the supercharged 6.2-liter V8 is pretty cool, plus each one if hand-assembled by one builder, and it has 668-horsepower on tap, but keep in mind the Camaro ZL1 uses the LT4 to make 650-hp. I know cars are more than just their specs, but that’s not a huge power difference there, especially considering all the hype surrounding the Blackwing."

It’s such a GM thing to pour considerable resources into developing some new technology, overhype it, then quickly put it back on the shelf. What a colossal waste of resources endeavors like this are. Plus, they work to frustrate enthusiasts who get excited for the newest, shiny toy only for it to be rapidly canceled."
