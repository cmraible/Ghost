On top of that, this particular Mach 1 is believed to have around 49,000 original miles, and it sports some rare options including the Pastel Grey factory color, tachometer, radio delete and a W-code Traction-Lok rear end. All of this adds up to a Mustang that is ultra-desirable, making it a perfect addition to any collection."
