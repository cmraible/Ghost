<p>Philadelphia Eagles defensive lineman Malik Jackson is reportedly suing West Coast Customs. The legal action has to do with work being performed on two of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nfl-player-crashes-chevy-camaro-into-lake-eerie/">NFL player’s cars</a>. Chief among the claims is that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driven-restores-carroll-shelbys-detomaso-pantera/">famous shop</a> in Burbank, California has overcharged for work performed on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rob-gronkowski/">football player’s rides</a>.</p>
<p>In July of 2019, Jackson claims he reached an agreement with West Coast Customs to transform his two Chevrolets into hot rods. The work is ongoing, which depending on how extensive builds might be, isn’t unheard of in this industry. Adding to the problems is the claim the shop wants more money that what was originally agreed to for the work to be completed.</p>
<p>One of the two cars owned by Jackson is a Chevy gasser. According to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nfl-player-crashes-chevy-camaro-into-lake-eerie/">football player</a>, he forked over $200,000 for the vehicle to be rebuilt and further customized. Now he says West Coast Customs is asking for more than an additional $37,000 to wrap up the project.</p>
<p>The other car is referred to as a Chevy “cruiser” in the filing. The claim is that West Coast Customs is asking for $150,000 over the initial agreed-upon amount. If true, that’s a huge increase in pricing and something which would make most customers pretty upset.</p>
<p>To say Jackson isn’t your average car owner would be an understatement. The NFL defensive lineman is worth some serious cash, signing a three-year, $30 million deal with the Eagles last year. He’s no stranger to controversy, using his personal Instagram account to call out NFL team owners for supposedly engaging in “unacceptable and disrespectful” practices for handling the COVID-19 pandemic for the 2020-2021 season and providing players “with no safety/financial guarantee.”</p>
<p>Breach of contract is the driving point of this lawsuit, with Jackson’s attorneys asking for $187,000 in damages.</p>
<p>TMZ hit up West Coast Customs for their side of the claims but the famous auto shop provided no comment. WCC roared into the public eye thanks to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-kings-restores-lil-red-wrecker/"><em>Pimp My Ride</em></a> almost two decades ago.</p>
