If you fall on the forced induction side, you might already be a ProCharger fan. The supercharger manufacturer has made quite the name for itself in the performance world with some impressive designs. It’s with great anticipation we check out this 2020 Chevrolet Silverado running the ProCharger D-1X kit."

Apparently it was quite the series of delays and frustrations getting the truck tuned correctly, including spark advance and fueling issues. There were also some problems with the dyno itself, but the wait was well worth it once they got everything figured out, since the shop believes this is the most powerful 2020 Silverado out there."

It’s worth noting this truck is running on methanol, so if you want to call that cheating go ahead. We can’t wait to see how this pickup turns out in the future."

The new X generation of these centrifugal superchargers have been designed for improved efficiency and power. When combined with the new Silverado the result is pretty amazing."
