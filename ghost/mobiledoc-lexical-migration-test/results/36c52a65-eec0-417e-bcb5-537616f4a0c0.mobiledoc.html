<p>Friends:</p>
<p>With so much on the line on Election Day next Tuesday, please expect additional reports from us in your inbox in the coming days, as we aim to provide you with all the midterm information you need to know. We will return to our normal publication schedule after the election.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to share an eye-opening in-person interview I just conducted with congressional candidate Summer Lee, who is battling big-money interests to win Pennsylvania‚Äôs 12th congressional district next week. Why does Lee think she‚Äôs facing such strong opposition from a billionaire-funded, pro-Israel super PAC? As she puts it, it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs ‚Äúa progressive Black woman.‚Äù</p>
<p>Below is an abridged Q&A from my discussion with Lee.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a pro-Israel super PAC spent <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/aipac-attack-ad-summer-lee/">nearly $3 million</a> attacking Summer Lee in the Democratic primary for Pennsylvania‚Äôs 12th congressional district, running ads claiming she was a bad Democrat. Now, the same group is spending big to defeat Lee in her general election race against a Republican.</p>
<p>The United Democracy Project ‚Äî which has been <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2022?cmte=C00799031&tab=donors_all">bankrolled</a> by the powerful pro-Israel advocacy group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and conservative billionaires ‚Äî recently put more than $1 million into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2cuyktTMQo">TV ads</a> attacking Lee, according to data from AdImpact. The group has also <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202210309546675272">spent</a> about $80,000 on mailers opposing Lee.</p>
<p>Why is AIPAC‚Äôs super PAC spending millions on the race? In a recent interview with <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs David Sirota in Pittsburgh, Lee said she believes that the organization is targeting her because she‚Äôs ‚Äúa progressive Black woman.‚Äù</p>
<p>She continued: ‚ÄúI can find no other answer or reasoning, but for the fact that progressive Black women in these spaces pose a threat to corporate interests and to corporate power. And these are Republican billionaires who are worried about their bottom line.‚Äù</p>
<p>The United Democracy Project‚Äôs spending could help Republicans win a House majority in the midterm elections next week. Lee is currently locked in a surprisingly tight race ‚Äî potentially in part due to the fact that her Republican opponent, Mike Doyle, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-12th-congressional-district-mike-doyle-summer-lee/">shares the same name</a> as the retiring longtime Democratic lawmaker whom Lee is running to succeed.</p>
<p>Below is a lightly edited, abridged Q&A from Sirota‚Äôs discussion with Lee.</p>
<p><strong>David Sirota: </strong>Tell me a little bit about what‚Äôs going on at the end of this race. I know there‚Äôs the fake Mike Doyle versus you and AIPAC is coming in with all this money.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Lee:</strong> You know, we had a group that came in, in the primary, making the argument that I wasn‚Äôt a Democrat enough, that I was ‚Äúother‚Äù in some way and not loyal to the party, and the same exact folks are putting a million dollars in right now to deliver a Republican majority to Kevin McCarthy.</p>
<p><strong>Sirota: </strong>Yeah, so what do you think it‚Äôs about? Why are they so focused on you?</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> I mean, I cannot find any other indication but that it would have to be that I‚Äôm a progressive Black woman. I can find no other explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Sirota: </strong>It can‚Äôt be the party. Like they‚Äôre now going in for a Republican.</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> It‚Äôs not that, and to be completely honest, if they cared as much as we do in Pittsburgh, and in our community, about the growing threat of this right-wing nationalism that we see and all of its manifestations ‚Äî anti-Blackness and anti-semitism ‚Äî if they cared as much about that as we do here, then they could never throw down for a candidate that we know will support that, a candidate that we know is going to caucus with those folks, and has already <a href="https://twitter.com/SummerForPA/status/1585264669895409673">campaigned</a> with someone who we know <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/democrats-say-doug-mastriano-breached-police-lines-jan-6-insurrection/">was at the insurrection</a>.</p>
<p>So I can find no other answer or reasoning, but for the fact that progressive Black women in these spaces pose a threat to corporate interests and to corporate power. And these are Republican billionaires who are worried about their bottom line.</p>
<p><strong>Sirota:</strong> Do you think it goes beyond the Israel issue?</p>
<p><strong>Lee: </strong>I would never be able to speak on whether it‚Äôs an Israel issue, because none of their complaints against me in their million-dollar ads have ever mentioned Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Sirota:</strong> How‚Äôs the party been once you won the primary? Has there been a healing, or is there still a rift?</p>
<p><strong>Lee: </strong>I mean, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs been healing or a rift. I think that the tensions that we experience nationwide are reflected here also. And we‚Äôre growing and we‚Äôre building new relationships, and we‚Äôre pushing our comfort level in good ways, and sometimes in bad ways. So there‚Äôs a number of folks in the party who were with us in the beginning, to be very clear. I believe I have more elected officials supporting me than all of the candidates combined in the primary. So even as we came out of the primary to the general, there were a few holdouts. There are a few folks who were never going to support me for what their personal reasons are, but the mass majority truly are and truly have been in the trenches with us and fighting.</p>
<p><strong>Sirota: </strong>When you get to Congress, there are a lot of folks out there who feel like the Progressive Caucus is not holding out enough for progressive priorities. What do you say to folks like that who feel like they‚Äôve been doing it for election after election after election, and they feel disillusioned?</p>
<p><strong>Lee: </strong>Yeah, it‚Äôs tough. I say this often, that these systems weren‚Äôt built overnight, they‚Äôre not going to be dismantled overnight. And recognizing that and making sure that we are all accountable as a movement towards a strategy that will ever move us forward. And I think one of the most important things that we can do, having appropriate metrics is going to be major. What are our goals, this term in this position? How are we moving it forward?</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt always look like we‚Äôre moving the needle fast enough, and sometimes we‚Äôre not. And sometimes it‚Äôs harder. I‚Äôve seen now how much harder it is to move, when I see the forces that rise up against me, and I‚Äôm not even there yet. The millions and millions of dollars that come in to silence progressives, to make sure that progressives aren‚Äôt as bold as they can be or would otherwise be‚Ä¶ When I see those forces at play, I see how hard and how hostile it can be for progressives and government, and progressives in movement spaces. So we‚Äôve got to fight, we have to keep fighting forward is really the answer.</p>
