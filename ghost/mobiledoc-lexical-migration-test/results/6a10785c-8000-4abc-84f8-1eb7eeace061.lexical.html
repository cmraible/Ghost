<p>Pontiac was once a great manufacturer within the American automotive industry before its collapse in 2009. This incredible automaker was the creator of models like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/five-quick-facts-about-the-pontiac-gto/">GTO</a> and Firebird, which have become cultural icons. Especially in the automotive enthusiast world, the Pontiac brand is considered a long-lost legend. So it makes sense that a few years ago, someone took it upon themself to recreate one of the brand's most memorable vehicles. Trans Am Depot is now a significant innovator in the car lover community, so you should consider this excellent pony car for your next automotive purchase.</p>

<p>Owned originally by comedian Gabriel "Fluffy" Iglesias', this 2015 Chevrolet Camaro is number 20 of just <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1977-pontiac-trans-am-se-bandit-edition/">77 Trans Am Bandit</a> editions made by Trans AM Depot. Along with some performance upgrades, you also get a Trans Am style grille and taillights, which pay homage to the '77 model. All of this adds up to a pretty good-looking vehicle that resembles the original Bandit Trans Am very well. Even the hood, which typically features a cowl on the Camaro, was swapped out for a shaker hood. That glorious exterior is also accompanied by an equally gorgeous interior with a set of Firebird wings on the door panels.</p>

<p>Under the hood is a massive 6.2-liter V8 engine which features some modifications from Trans Am Depot to produce some gigantic power figures. These figures range from a low of 550 horsepower to a maximum of around 840; either way, this car is wickedly fast. All that power is then sent through a six-speed manual transmission which will indeed have you shaking in your seat at the raw power and performance. Overall, this is a fantastic car; whether you're looking at its performance, style, or name recognition, you should seriously consider it for your next automotive adventure.</p>
