<p>One year ago, as price hikes were becoming a major national concern, the world‚Äôs third-richest man <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizen-bezos-logs-on/">touted</a> his newspaper columnist asserting that corporate profits were not a driving force behind inflation ‚Äî blaming temporary COVID-19 pandemic aid instead.</p>
<p>While <em>Washington Post</em> owner Jeff Bezos and others were trying to steer the inflation discourse away from a focus on business profiteering, there <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond">was already data</a> showing that most of the price increases Americans were experiencing could be attributed to larger corporate profit margins.</p>
<p>Those figures were hardly surprising: Corporations that had been permitted to grow into oligopolies during the era of lax antitrust enforcement were now able to leverage their <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/2/561/5714769">outsized market power</a> to hike prices ‚Äî and to do so with less fear of competitors undercutting them. It‚Äôs a reality that has <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-review/how-much-have-record-corporate-profits-contributed-to-recent-inflation/">since</a><a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/insights/chief-investment-office/market-insights/paul-donovan/2023/profit-led-price-increases.html">been</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/business/company-profit-inflation-europe.html">recognized</a> by a Federal Reserve study, a top economist at UBS, European central bankers, and, most recently, Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-is-inflation-so-sticky-it-could-be-corporate-profits-b78d90b7"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>.</p>
<p>And yet, corporate media outlets ignored the available data, choosing to publish and platform pundits who scoffed at accusations of what they derisively called ‚Äúgreedflation‚Äù and who <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamGreen/status/1458810260504907781">insisted</a> that the problem is workers being paid higher wages. That decision delivered devastating consequences for America‚Äôs working class.</p>

<p>As with the WMD lies used to justify the deadly Iraq war, and financial deregulation triumphalism leading to the 2008 financial crisis and bank bailouts, the fake media narrative about inflation became conventional wisdom, was echoed by lawmakers, and justified specific policies. In this case, the narrative provided government officials justification to cut off pandemic aid, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-joe-manchin-congress-climate-and-environment-0bfd4f4a54b1f4e57a8950980c3e13cd">block new spending</a>, abandon any push for a minimum wage increase, and raise interest rates with the express goal of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/powell-lets-wall-street-pay-skyrocket-while-targeting-workers-wages/">driving down workers‚Äô wages</a>.</p>
<p>The results: a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ending-pandemic-aid-created-a-disaster/">sharp increase</a> in the number of Americans who can‚Äôt afford to pay their bills, and now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-companies-conducting-layoffs-in-2023-heres-the-list-11673288386">mass layoffs</a> amid a slowing economy.</p>
<p>Directing blame for inflation away from corporations and toward government spending that temporarily boosted the working class was lucrative for the world‚Äôs wealthiest like Bezos and for the giant companies that belong to corporate lobbying groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The discourse manipulation helped stall momentum for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-dems-pass-gas-price-gouging-bill-faces/story?id=84806090">anti-price-gouging legislation</a>, higher taxes on the wealthy, and an <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/time-to-tax-excessive-corporate-profits/">excessive corporate profits tax</a>. The propaganda also provided a justification for companies to keep jacking up prices as the government inflicted economic pain on workers and families.</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em> contacted several pundits who helped cement the narrative that ‚Äúgreedflation‚Äù was fake, and by extension, that government aid to the working class was the primary inflation culprit. Those who replied offered no apologies for helping create propaganda that justified cutting off millions of Americans from that aid, and they offered no response to a series of reports and analyses indicating that corporate profits have been driving historic price increases ‚Äî exactly as some progressives accurately noted.</p>
<h3 id="a-%E2%80%9Cflimsy%E2%80%9D-democratic-%E2%80%9Cconspiracy-theory%E2%80%9D">A ‚ÄúFlimsy‚Äù Democratic ‚ÄúConspiracy Theory‚Äù</h3>
<p>Early last year, the <em>Washington Post</em> editorial board <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/10/white-house-again-offers-bizarre-message-inflation/">published an op-ed</a> claiming that President Joe Biden‚Äôs White House was offering ‚Äúa bizarre message on inflation,‚Äù asserting that ‚Äúpinning the current inflation problems on corporate greed is a flimsy argument.‚Äù</p>
<p>When House and Senate Democrats scheduled hearings a few months later on the role of corporate profiteering in inflation, the U.S. Chamber, the nation‚Äôs top business lobby, responded with letters to lawmakers <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/economy/u-s-chamber-letter-on-a-hearing-on-inflation-in-the-senate-budget-committee">pointing</a><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/assets/documents/220308_InflationHearing_HFSC_2022-03-08-143422_xyyv.pdf">them</a> to the <em>Post</em> op-ed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe premise of your hearing has been roundly refuted by economists,‚Äù the organization wrote to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Ind.-Vt) in April 2022.</p>
<p>To an extent, the Chamber was right: The economist and pundit class had certainly disputed the notion that profiteering was playing a key role in driving inflation.</p>
<p>So did Republican lawmakers like Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who used his time in the hearing to try to shift blame away from corporate price gouging and instead towards government spending.</p>

<p>First, he <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/senate-event/LC68259/text?s=1&r=5">cited</a> former Clinton Treasury Secretary Larry Summers‚Äô <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/04/larry-summers-biden-covid-stimulus/">warning</a> that Democrats‚Äô 2021 pandemic aid package would spur inflation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDemocrats ignored common sense,‚Äù said Grassley, adding that they were now ‚Äúgrasping at straws to find a scapegoat, hence, blaming inflation on corporate greed, never mind that economists across the political spectrum overwhelmingly reject the theory.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, Lindsay Owens, executive director at the Groundwork Collaborative, <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/download/lindsay-owens-testimony-april-2022">testified</a> to Sanders‚Äô budget committee that her organization had reviewed hundreds of earnings calls, and found that corporate CEOs were actively bragging to investors that they had been able to mark up costs on goods and services far beyond the rising costs paid by the companies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver and over, in sector after sector, the message from corporate America is clear: CEOs are telling their investors that the current inflationary environment has created significant opportunities to extract more and more profit by raising prices on consumers,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúTheir strategy is simple ‚Äî pass along rising costs, and then take even more.‚Äù</p>
<p>A few weeks after Sanders‚Äô hearing, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/">released a study</a> that found: ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãCorporate profits have contributed disproportionately to inflation.‚Äù</p>
<p>EPI‚Äôs chief economist Josh Bivens wrote that more than half of companies‚Äô price increases since the start of the pandemic ‚Äúcan be attributed to fatter profit margins, with labor costs contributing less than 8 percent of this increase,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúThis is not normal.‚Äù</p>
<p>The EPI analysis should have been definitive ‚Äî but the corporate pundit class chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>A few weeks after EPI released its study, <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Catherine Rampell wrote <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/12/democratic-conspiracy-theory-on-inflation-makes-things-worse/">an op-ed</a> calling ‚Äúgreedflation‚Äù a Democratic ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù equivalent to conservatives using a veterinary drug to try to cure COVID-19.</p>
<p>Rampell, who once wrote a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-12-20-0612200263-story.html">piece</a> standing up for legacy admissions at Princeton University such as herself, soon published <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/16/democrats-need-more-tough-love-economy-inflation-greedflation-biden/">another column</a> arguing that Democrats were wrong to discuss corporate greed as a factor driving inflation . She instead cast partial blame on the one-time $1,400 pandemic aid payments mailed out by Democrats shortly after Biden took office.</p>
<p>Bezos, the <em>Post</em>‚Äôs owner, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizen-bezos-logs-on/">blasted Rampell‚Äôs column</a> out to his millions of followers on Twitter, a few days after he <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1525309091970699265">criticized</a> Biden for arguing that raising corporate taxes would help bring down inflation.</p>
<p>Rampell separately <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/25/inflation-cause-democrats-amplify-nonsense-corporate-greed/">wrote</a>, ‚ÄúFor ‚Äòcorporate greed‚Äô to be the culprit behind the recent spike in prices, well, you‚Äôd have to believe either that businesses suddenly got much greedier ‚Äî that this is the greediest Thanksgiving ever! ‚Äî or that businesses somehow suddenly got much more effective at acting upon that greed.‚Äù</p>
<p>The latter appears to be exactly what happened: Data compiled by the Roosevelt Institute study <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RI_PricesProfitsPower_202206.pdf">suggested that</a> corporations that had grown larger in the era of lax antitrust enforcement were able to use their expanded market power to inflate prices, knowing they would not be undercut by competitors.</p>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em> and Rampell did not respond to questions from <em>The Lever</em>.</p>
<p>As recently as February, <a href="https://twitter.com/crampell/status/1622281046782889984?lang=en">Rampell</a><a href="https://twitter.com/crampell/status/1622290651202129922?s=20">tweeted</a><a href="https://twitter.com/crampell/status/1622290651202129922">out</a> that those questioning her assertions about inflation are ‚Äúinternet trolls‚Äù and that despite all the data, she was right to repeatedly suggest that corporate profits were not a driver of price hikes.</p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Ci-stand-by-that-100-percent%E2%80%9D">‚ÄúI Stand By That 100 Percent‚Äù</h3>
<p>The <em>Post</em> editorial board and Rampell were far from alone in arguing that it was a ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù to suggest that corporate profits are responsible for much of the price inflation that people have experienced during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1524907155513659395">shared</a> Rampell‚Äôs column about Democrats‚Äô inflation ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù on Twitter, praising her for calling out ‚Äúthis dangerous misguided nonsense.‚Äù</p>
<p>A scion of a wealthy and powerful real estate family, Furman later <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1526034456716488705">tweeted</a> that ‚Äúmany of the arguments for ‚Äògreedflation‚Äô are unequivocally wrong & confused.‚Äù</p>
<p>Economist Justin Wolfers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139342874/corporate-greed-and-the-inflation-mystery">told NPR</a> last fall, ‚ÄúMy friend and economist Jason Furman says, ‚ÄòBlaming inflation on greed is like blaming a plane crash on gravity.‚Äô It is technically correct, but it entirely misses the point.‚Äù</p>
<p>Furman continued to double down on this narrative when contacted by <em>The Lever</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do think corporations maximize their profits and try to raise prices as high as they can ‚Äî and that we have too much corporate concentration so prices are too high,‚Äù Furman said.<em></em>‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt see any evidence that changed over the last few years. What did change was demand fueled by highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policy.‚Äù</p>

<p>Summers, the former Clinton Treasury Secretary who helped usher in the deregulation of the banking industry that led to the 2008 financial crisis and created ‚Äútoo-big-to-fail‚Äù banks, said in May 2022 that the idea that corporate profits <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/05/16/the-debate-over-greedflation">played a role</a> in inflation was ‚Äúpreposterous.‚Äù</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) <a href="https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/record-high-gas-prices-reflect-democrats-misunderstanding">amplified</a> Summers and Furman‚Äôs criticisms of the ‚Äúgreedflation‚Äù narrative on the Senate floor last May.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg Opinion</em> columnist Matt Yglesias, whose Slow Boring blog is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/01/11/matt-yglesias-slow-boring-in-bidens-washington/">reportedly read</a> by White House staff, wrote a <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/greedflation-is-fake">post</a> last May entitled: ‚ÄúGreedflation is fake.‚Äù Yglesias urged readers to suppose they ran a company that decides to hike prices in response to a temporary surge in demand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo imagine your surprise when politicians start screaming that the high-profit margins prove that this inflation is really ‚Äògreedflation‚Äô driven by monopoly power when all you did was make tables available promptly to people who wanted tables,‚Äù he wrote, adding: ‚ÄúGreed is a constant. But the cause of this particular inflation was a surge in demand, not a surge in greed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Reached for comment by <em>The Lever</em>, Yglesias responded, ‚ÄúIn terms of my piece, I believe my thesis ‚Äî as you yourself quoted it back to me ‚Äî was that inflation could not possibly be attributed to an increase in the level of corporate greed. I stand by that 100 percent.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúWhat I remember from my economics textbooks is that if you have a surge in demand that runs up against relatively inelastic supply, what happens is that prices go up (inflation) and so do profits ‚Äî that‚Äôs broadly speaking what I think is going on here and what I assume the economists whose work you‚Äôre summarizing are explaining.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="corporate-spin-to-%E2%80%9Cdisguise-profit-margin-expansion%E2%80%9D">Corporate Spin To ‚ÄúDisguise Profit Margin Expansion‚Äù</h3>
<p>Several recent economic studies and comments from central bankers indicate that corporate profits are, in fact, driving price hikes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirms raised markups during 2021 in anticipation of future cost pressures, contributing substantially to inflation,‚Äù researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City wrote in an <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-review/how-much-have-record-corporate-profits-contributed-to-recent-inflation/">economic review</a> published this January.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23798346-what-is-profit-led-inflation-march-2023">March</a>, UBS Chief Economist Paul Donovan released a revealing commentary concluding: ‚ÄúRecent inflation has been driven by an unusual expansion of profit margins.‚Äù</p>
<p>He explained: ‚ÄúProfit margin-led inflation is not caused by a supply-demand imbalance. Profit margin-led inflation is when some companies spin a story that convinces customers that price increases are ‚Äòfair,‚Äô when in fact they disguise profit margin expansion.‚Äù</p>
<p>Donovan noted that ‚Äúwidespread reports of rising agricultural prices allow supermarkets and restaurants to raise the price of food.‚Äù Other spinnable stories include ‚Äúsupply chain disruption (in fact global trade is at a record high), labor shortages (in fact wage costs are rising far less than prices), and in the most circular of arguments ‚Äògeneral inflation,‚Äô‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p>Several days later, a top official at the European Central Bank gave a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/business/company-profit-inflation-europe.html">speech</a> suggesting that corporate profiteering is sustaining inflation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOpportunistic behaviour by firms could also delay the fall in core inflation,‚Äù <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230322_2~af38beedf3.en.html">said</a> Fabio Panetta, an executive board member at the bank. ‚ÄúIn fact, unit profits contributed to more than half of domestic price pressures in the last quarter of 2022. In some industries, profits are increasing strongly and retail prices are rising rapidly, in spite of the fact that wholesale prices have been decreasing for some time.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúThis suggests that some producers have been exploiting the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation and supply-demand mismatches to increase their margins, raising prices beyond what was necessary to absorb cost increases.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the conservative <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-is-inflation-so-sticky-it-could-be-corporate-profits-b78d90b7"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> reported, ‚ÄúInflation has proved more stubborn than central banks bargained for when prices started surging two years ago. Now some economists think they know why: Businesses are using a rare opportunity to boost their profit margins.‚Äù</p>

<p>For its part, <em>The Washington Post</em> recently republished a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/11/inflation-consumers-are-too-passive-about-high-prices-for-cars-flights-hotels/3e2d4800-d820-11ed-aebd-3fd2ac4c460a_story.html">Bloomberg column</a> that noted: ‚ÄúThe idea that corporate profit expansion has been a big driver of inflation was once mostly confined to trade unions and left-wing academics, but it‚Äôs now taken seriously.‚Äù</p>
