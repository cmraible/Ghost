However, we don't hear much about some of the worst things to ever happen to these cars. Alongside the tales of victorious endurance races and quick turns, there are also stories of tragedy and hardship. Today we have one such story, and while it does have a happy ending, this will make all of you Ferrari fans cringe for this beautiful burned-up masterpiece."

Rather than giving up on this car, the seller decided to send it to a world-class restoration shop in New Jersey. Because the car was not yet titled there would be no record of the fire. So, after 3 years of rebuilding, the vehicle was finally back to its original quality."

          ", however, this second car was equipped with the LM package. After hearing stories about both cars, he had always longed to hear the sound of that beautiful engine start-up. The LM was fully straight piped and had bigger turbos than stock which ran quite a lot more boost as well so he always knew that the sound would be spectacular. Finally, he got his chance when the owner decided to take the car to a Ferrari race event, it was beautiful. Eric described it as more of an experience, as he puts it “You don't hear it, you feel it in your chest.”"
