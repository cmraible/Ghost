<hr>
<p>Cars can be considered <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1996-porsche-993-turbo-pts-ferrari-fly-yellow/">rare for any number of reason</a>s. Some have an engine or transmission that wasn’t used for the rest of the model, or maybe it sports a unique interior. We have even seen the determining factor of rareness be brought down to a part as small and as inconsequential as a clock. That's not the case with <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1996-porsche-993-turbo-pts-ferrari-fly-yellow/">this Porsche 993 Turbo</a>. What makes this highly sought after car so special is the most noticeable part of the car: Its finish, which is not even a Porsche color.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1996-porsche-993-turbo-pts-ferrari-fly-yellow/">1996 Paint-to-Sample Ferrari Fly Yellow 993</a> features a black leather interior with carbon-fiber trim. It is said to have been purchased through Porsche’s Tourist Delivery Program, and toured around Europe only to be brought to California and sold to its second owner. For those not aware of Porsche’s Tourist Delivery Program, that is where the buyer gets to go pick the car up directly from Porsche while on vacation in Europe. While it does seem like an intriguing offer, the second owner appears to be the one that actually fell in love with the car. The car spent the next 22 years, and only 33,000 miles being pampered and upgraded before being sold again.</p>
