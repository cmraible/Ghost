<hr>
<p>Losing a loved one is difficult, but losing a family member to a murder which has gone unsolved for years is even worse. That reality has driven a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-buys-dodge-challenger-stealing/">Memphis, Tennessee</a> family to offer their beloved <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/remember-the-c4-callaway-twin-turbo-and-zr1/">C4 Corvette</a> and $10,000 cash for information leading to the killer of Dennis Gilliam. The hope is someone out there knows something which could <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/teen-solves-27-year-mystery/">crack this cold case wide open</a>, finally <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/murder-suspect-stolen-bmw/">leading to justice</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Amazingly, someone junked a 1963 Corvette Z06 split window. See it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/junked-1963-corvette-zo6/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>With just 76,000 miles on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/junked-1963-corvette-zo6/">Corvette</a>, it could be the carrot which helps get the right person talking. The sports car belongs to Dennis’ brother Anthony. The family says in addition to the $10,000 they’re pledging to give an extra $500 a month for a year to the person who comes forward with information to put Gilliam’s murderer away.</p>
<p>Back on the night of September 23, 2011 Dennis Gilliam was shot dead in his house after a fight broke out in front of it just hours before. Allegedly, Gilliam’s stepdaughter’s boyfriend, Ryan Nelson, was involved in the fight, shooting off his gun.</p>
<p>Gilliam’s brother Anthony, who was present at the fight, said Dennis was encouraged to leave his own house. “These kids ain’t fixing to run me out of my own damn house,” Anthony said his brother told him. The next morning, Anthony Gilliam was found by his wife in his bed with two gunshot wounds to the head.</p>
<p>Nelson was arrested for aggravated assault because he discharged his weapon during the fight, but Gilliam’s family felt he also killed Anthony. They claim police told them the bullets fired during the night matched those from the murder scene. However, Nelson was only incarcerated for aggravated assault. The district attorney said there wasn’t enough evidence to bring murder charges against the man, despite Gilliam’s stepdaughter saying Nelson admitted to the crime.</p>
<p>The DA also says with additional evidence this cold case could be reopened. The family hopes the promise of a cool Corvette, plus plenty of cash is enough incentive to get someone talking.</p>
