The son was tempted to just sell the car for scrap and get something else, but the father pressed on, cutting off the top and pushing for them to find a roof donor, which they did. He then took the time to weld the new roof on, including adding reinforcements to ensure proper structural rigidity. Talk about dedication to the cause!"
