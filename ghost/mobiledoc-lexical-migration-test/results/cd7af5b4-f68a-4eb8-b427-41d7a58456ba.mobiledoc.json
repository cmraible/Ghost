The amount of variety in this game that is so clearly themed around the boring repetition of a 9-5 work cycle is a really interesting and effective choice that keeps it from ever feeling repetitive or boring. The boss fights, level design, combat, puzzles and pretty much everything else are constantly keeping the player on their toes in intelligent and dynamic ways."

The thing that can be seen as annoying is the obnoxious exclamations that the characters make every time they jump or use weapons. It’s not an uncommon thing for the main character to have a “jumping noise” but that’s more common (and welcome) in 3D platformers that usually have less jumping and a more engaging score that would help conceal the issue. This is a game best played on mute with your favorite music or podcast on in the background because otherwise, it’s nothing but ambient music with cheesy anime-ish soundbites that correspond to nearly every button push.
