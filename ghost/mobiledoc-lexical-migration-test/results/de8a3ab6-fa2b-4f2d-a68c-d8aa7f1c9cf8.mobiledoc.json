At the same time, Packard designers were already pushing past limits set before the outset of the war, such as the front fenders which flow seamlessly into the front portion of the doors."

Maroon upholstery with white accent piping, leather, wood, and chrome all have a sumptuous feel to them, plus there are amenities like a fold-down armrest in the backseat. Just as impressive is the 17.2 cubic foot trunk, where the NOS jack stand and spare Firestone whitewall tire are stored."
