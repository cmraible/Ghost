A series of tips allowed the Whatcom County Sheriff's Department to locate the stolen classic within a few hours but not before they were led on a multi-city pursuit that ended in Blaine, Washington. According to the Blaine Police Department's Facebook page, the suspected car thief was apparently injured after the chase ended, and he was transported to the hospital before being taken to the county jail and booked on \"multiple\" felony charges."
