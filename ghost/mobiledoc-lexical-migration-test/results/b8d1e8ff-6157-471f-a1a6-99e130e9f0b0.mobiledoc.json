We’re not too familiar with Welsh law, but we assume that means they found some loophole which allowed for what essentially equates to legal theft of property."

Taking the property of someone who’s struggling doesn’t seem like a great solution. What we want to know is why no neighbors stepped in and helped the guy out?
