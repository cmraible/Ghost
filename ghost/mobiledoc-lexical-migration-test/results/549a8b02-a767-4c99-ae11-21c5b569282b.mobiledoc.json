That wasn't enough power for the seller of this ZR1 as extensive upgrades were added such as Lingenfelter supercharger pulleys, methanol injection, C&C ported heads, special COMP Cam and carbon fiber exhaust. There's no telling how much power this engine lays down now, but we're sure it's fast and sounds incredible."

For added style and performance, the Corvette is finished with HRE wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 high-performance tires. While this ZR1 was made for the track, we can't imagine it's seen many track days with an odometer reading of just 4,123 miles."
