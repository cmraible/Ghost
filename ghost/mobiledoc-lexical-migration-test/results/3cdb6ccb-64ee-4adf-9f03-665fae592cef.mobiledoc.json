That’s why news of a 1967 Toyota 2000GT selling for $2,535,000 at Amelia Island this last weekend is causing waves. It seems people think all Toyotas are like a Camry or RAV4, but the 2000GT has been a legitimate collector’s car for quite some time."

Toyota decided to make the 2000GT something which would rival European and American sports cars in quality and performance. Keep in mind, this was back when most Toyotas were small, boxy, and anything but fast. With a curvaceous form and a decent showing in motorsports, it started to shift perspectives."

The man who brought us the Cobra and made Ford’s secretary’s car into a performance machine fielded two Toyota 2000GTs for the 1968 SCCA C-Production Racing series. It was Toyota’s first entrance into American racing, creating a legacy."

That’s a long time to retain such a vehicle and understandably some collectors were chomping at the bit to finally have a shot at it. Instead of hiding it away, the owner did share this car with the public. For example, it was displayed and raced at the 2004 Goodwood Festival of Speed. It also took first in class at the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance."
