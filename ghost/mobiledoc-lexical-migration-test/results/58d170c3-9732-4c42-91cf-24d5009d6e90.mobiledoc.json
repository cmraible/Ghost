          "Humvee is short for HMMWV, an acronym that stands for \"High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle\" built by AM General and were strictly military vehicles. Originally, there wasn't a plan to develop stripped-down version for the civilian market, but it was Arnold Schwarzenegger who convinced the automaker to build them to sell to the general public after seeing a convoy on a movie set. These weren't offered until the early '90s, as the Hollywood muscle man received his in 1992 called the Hummer H1. "

          "One of the widest vehicles on the road, the exterior of this H1 is painted in a glossy black and looks mean while cruising down the road without doors. No worries, this bad boy does come with all four doors and along with a vinyl top in a contrasting beige. A set of Black Rhino wheels sit on all four corners perfectly add to the utility vehicle's tough aesthetic. The wheels are wrapped with a set of 37-inch Milestar rubber. The headlights and taillights have been converted to modern LED lighting. For some off-road fun, kick this H1 into four-wheel-drive and take to the trails. Able to seat a total of six occupants, there's still plenty of room in the bed to haul all your supplies. "

Driving feel of this beast is stiff thanks to a heavy-duty suspension that was made to withstand the roughest of terrains. Inside this utility vehicle sits a black interior, and sits 6 people as mentioned above. The Humvee comes with the aforementioned truck bed along with a heavy-duty trailer hitch to that allows you to hook a trailer to haul that race car to the track or your boat to the lake."
