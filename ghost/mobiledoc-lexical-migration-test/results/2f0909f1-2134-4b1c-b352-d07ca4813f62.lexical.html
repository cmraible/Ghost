<p>When some of the social media gurus of the world started proclaiming that “<a href="http://www.briansolis.com/2013/10/social-business-is-dead-long-live-whats-next/">social business was dead</a>” a while back, my immediate thought was “this is where it gets interesting”.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, when the shiny suited bandwagon jumpers move on it’s pretty much a sign that the peak of inflated expectations is over, and that we’re passing through the trough of disillusionment towards a plateau of productivity. And yes, gentle reader, I am alluding to the <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/john_pescatore/2008/11/21/the-lack-of-wisdom-of-crowds/">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> here:</p>

<p>Once the flash and dash of the early hype is over, the serious work gets done. We’re seeing some interesting new businesses emerging in the space, like my friends <a href="http://www.theagileelephant.com">Agile Elephant</a> and now a post Headshift/Dachis Lee Bryant and Livio Hughes with <a href="http://postshift.com">Post*Shift</a>.</p>
<p>They held their launch part last night, and while I can’t claim to completely understand what the company is right now – some hybrid of an incubator, an investor and a strategic consultant as far as I could tell – I’m certainly interested to see what they do over the next couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-interesting-notes-from-the-introduction-talks">A few interesting notes from the introduction talks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Existing companies are prone to “innovation tourism” – where they go visit innovators and startups, and then go back to doing exactly what they did before.</li>
    <li>Existing companies tend to become entities whose purpose is protecting their business model. They’re disruption-adverse.</li>
    <li>Startups may be <em>more</em> professional than many businesses, as they run lean and with zero waste – they just can’t afford it.</li>
    <li>There are many company structures which have existed conceptually for decades – but which social technology is finally making practical</li>
    <li>The management consultancy model hasn’t significantly changed in a century. It needs rethinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right at the end of the talks, Lee touched on a small obsession of mine, when he started talking about how the disruption that the internet can bring could interface with more physical businesses – industry, manufacturing and the like (<a href="http://nextberlin.eu/2013/11/mobile-industrial-tech-the-next-startup-frontier/">I’ve written about this for NEXT Berlin</a>). I’m desperate to see startup thinking and social business start to spread beyond the obvious confines of knowledge workers and mobile apps. Looks like Post*Shift could be planning on making some inroads into a much wider discussion about the future of work – and that could be worth watching.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
