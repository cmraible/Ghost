The fact the SUVs are dressed up in chrome and other nice trim, combined with the high cost of models sold in North America, mean pretty much nobody is out hitting the Rubicon or any other trail for fear of damage."

Either the Mercedes is chopped up and being sold piece by piece at the moment, or it was immediately loaded onto a boat bound for an overseas nation. However, the investigation could lead to the breakup of yet another luxury auto theft ring, so some good might come of it."
