          "Stretching a full 18 inches longer than the standard Scout II, the Scout II Terra pickup combines a three-person bench seat with a six-foot cargo bed. In its first year on the market (1976), International built less than 6,500 Scout II Terra pickup trucks, and out of that relatively low number, a mere 390 were equipped with the diesel engine option. The engine used is the Chrysler Nissan SD33 diesel engine, which is a 3.2-liter naturally aspirated inline-six. This engine is paired to a four-speed manual transmission and a two-speed, four-wheel-drive transfer case."

          "This 1976 International Scout II Terra is a beautiful example of the truck with a silver paint job and the white removable hard top. Pictures show a surprisingly clean green interior with options such as tilt steering, air conditioning and AM radio. Additional options on this truck include power steering, front disc brakes and a limited slip differential. Looking at the overall condition and rarity of this first-year Scout II Terra, it's hard to imagine there are many Scouts out there that are more collectible than this one."
