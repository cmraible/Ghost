The long history of the American automotive manufacturers and their various violent vehicles will always be revered as some of the most powerful performance cars ever. This has led to a surplus of automotive enthusiasts collecting and protecting mass sums of these crazy classic cars. In this new age of revitalized modern muscle cars dominating both the streets and the drag strip, the vintage vehicles of yesteryear are still widely appreciated. This is probably best shown with this particular collection which aims to showcase some of Americaâ€™s favorite hot rods.",
