<p>On this first episode, host David Sirota and <em>Lever </em>reporters will go deep on our reporting on why Democrats seem to be on the verge of an electoral disaster. We‚Äôll ask you to call in and give us your on-air take about some big questions:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Why does the party leadership seem so nonchalant about the situation?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ What is driving voters‚Äô disgust with the Biden administration?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Can anything be done to prevent Republicans from winning Congress, or is that what the White House actually wants?</p>
