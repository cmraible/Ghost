The man has uncovered some amazing treasure troves of automotive history, however his latest score is something to truly behold. As Dennis says, the group of Mustangs he was able to locate in Mooresville, North Carolina is amazing, considering they’re sitting in the racing capital of the United States."

They are an A Code, K Code, M Code, and finally an amazing R Code. We know what you’re thinking: they snagged a Cobra Jet, which is the kind of find everyone dreams of. The only thing is it’s not just a Cobra Jet, it’s a Super Cobra Jet which had quite the reputation at the local raceway back in its day."

Too often, we’ve seen classics left to rot in a field or a yard, slowly rejoining the earth from whence they came, a sad sight indeed."

Plenty of Ford Deuces you see at shows and cruising down the road are reproductions, not originals, so he’s wise to scoop up such a find."

The man definitely knows his Mustang history as he immediately recognized what it was. Doing your homework is absolutely a necessity before you go out into the field since you’ll have a better idea of what you’re looking at and how much it might be worth. Of course, Dennis has plenty of experience as well, a combination few possess."
