          "Combining its Silverstone Metallic exterior with a red interior, this 2001 Honda S2000 is already a sporty looking car, but factor in the rare hardtop option and now you're talking about a car that is sure to get looks wherever it goes. The removable hardtop is great for extreme cold- or hot-weather driving, while the power-retractable soft top allows for quick and easy open-air driving. What really makes this S2000 so special, though, is the fact that it survives in factory-original condition with just 30,000 actual miles showing on the odometer."

That's because it's powered by a 2.0-liter DOHC VTEC four-cylinder that sends 240 horsepower to the rear tires through a close-ratio six-speed manual transmission and limited-slip differential. With a curb weight of right around 2,800 pounds, the Honda S2000 drives and handles like a go-kart."
