It wasn’t until I started working with one client that had vintage Ferrari’s, Gullwing Mercedes and a vintage Bugatti type 57SC that I found a passion for pre-war cars. In a million years, I would never envision myself having a passion for these, “Pre-War” cars, but the first time I saw it sitting there in his garage, in all Black, it looked so sinister. One of my very good friends who is my age is a, “Pre-War” vintage automobile specialist; I discussed the types of pre-war cars that spoke to me and the styles I appreciate (a French style, as they have a swooping design that looks fast even sitting still). He opened my eyes up to several other pre-war examples that I have on my list of future cars and I feel like I am seeing a new type of car for the first time again. It’s exciting when your passion is renewed and new, fresh chapter opens."

Do your homework before you put your hand up. If a car is at a dealer, build a rapport with them, ask them questions and have them give you a background on the car, take the trip out to inspect the car or hire someone locally to do this for you. Make sure to do your due diligence. The hobby is alive and well, for those of you who haven’t dipped your toe in the water, educate yourself, be open minded, attend a local cars and coffee event and you will start to understand the excitement and passion that surrounds the collector car hobby.\""
