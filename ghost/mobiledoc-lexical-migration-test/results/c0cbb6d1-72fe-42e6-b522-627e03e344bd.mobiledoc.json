To access new levels, power ups and abilities on the map, you have to build and expand your army outwards and conquer the land. You are given four different buildings to place around the map and you have housing which creates four troops to deploy to other buildings, towers which provide food for the troops, soldiers barracks to fend off melee enemies and an archer’s post to fend off flying enemies. At first, I was actually enjoying the tower defense stuff, it was a good way to break up the gameplay so you don’t get bored of one playstyle; but after a while, most of my time was spent managing my army when all I wanted to do was just move on to the next platforming level."

Secret areas are well hidden but if you have a keen eye, you will notice that there will be cracks in the wall with a faint green light peeking out, indicating that a secret area is nearby. Most levels are designed around the elemental abilities found in that domain (i.e. earth abilities in earth levels or water abilities in water levels) which eliminates the need for backtracking for abilities, though you do get all of the base elemental abilities pretty early on, so felt a bit disappointing that the developers didn’t go all-in and require you to use multiple abilities to access secret areas until near the end of the game."

Each level has its own unique tracks but shares a theme based on where the level is located: Earth element levels have a heavier percussion, Electric element levels are more synth-based and Water element levels have a lighter, mystical tone. The overworld theme is done using trumpets with a march which keeps with the theme of leading an army but with how much time you end up spending on the overworld doing the tower defense management stuff, it does get pretty old relatively quickly."
