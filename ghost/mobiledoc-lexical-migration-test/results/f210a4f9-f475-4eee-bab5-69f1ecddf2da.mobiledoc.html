<hr>
<p>A lot of people wonder which would win in a race: the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1971-plymouth-cuda-auction/">1971 Plymouth Hemi ‘Cuda</a> or the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-copo-camaro-zl1-vs/">1969 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1</a>. It’s a natural thing to think about, considering both represent a particularly potent spec geared specifically at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-some-modern-muscle-cars-drag-race/">getting down the track faster than the competition</a>. That’s exactly what we get with the include video, which is great. Seeing two rare muscle cars created during the horsepower wars duke it out on the drag strip sure is a special treat.</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes to rarity, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/challenger-rt-races-copo-camaro/">’69 Camaro ZL1</a> wins hands down. Sure, not many people ponied up the several hundred dollars for the Hemi ‘Cuda option, but it was a much more popular model by far. The ZL1 set buyers back by an astounding $4,160 back in the day, so it was far too rich for most enthusiasts, no matter how dedicated they were to Chevrolet. That’s why a mere 69 of the cars were made, so you don’t see many around.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ‘Cuda, it of course hits hard with a 426ci Hemi V8, which is supposed to have 425-horsepower and 490 lb.-ft. of torque from the factory. However, that’s underrated by a good bit. A TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission means the driver can’t screw up a run with a messy gear change, even if that does mean less fun and potentially worse acceleration. Unfortunately, we don’t know what the rear gears are for this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/farm-classic-mopar-muscle-cars/">Mopar</a>. Tipping the scale at about 3,721 lbs., this ‘Cuda is a fairly lightweight fish.</p>

<p>As for the Chevrolet, it’s powered by a 427ci ZL1 V8 rated at 430-hp and 450 lb.-ft. of torque. Just like with the ‘Cuda, those ratings are well below the reality. Also, the Camaro features a TH400 automatic transmission, so at least these two cars are fairly matched in that respect. Just like on the Plymouth, the rear gears on this Chevy are a mystery. The Camaro ZL1 gets a slight advantage since its curb weight is about 3,500 lbs.</p>
<p>Both cars appear to be stock, but there might be some non-obvious engine modifications. After all, the Hemi ‘Cuda is apparently kicking out 1000-hp, and that’s without forced induction. But wait, the Camaro ZL1 has also been modified so the engine is making over 700-hp</p>
<p>It feels like this could be anyone’s race, but ultimately only one can win. Which do you think it will be?
