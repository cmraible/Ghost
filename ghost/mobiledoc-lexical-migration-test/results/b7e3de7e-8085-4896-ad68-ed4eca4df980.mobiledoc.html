<hr>
<p>Everything from the red, white, and blue paint job to the distinct lack of windshield wipers lets onlooking enthusiasts everywhere know exactly what this car is all about. You might have guessed that this is a certified drag racing car, but virtually no one could predict the sort of performance prevalent in this vehicle. That's because the automobile was built to prove to the world that AMC could make an incredible racing vehicle that would stun crowds at the racing track. So what exactly makes this vehicle such a fabulous racer even in today's world?</p>

<p>First, there is the wholly stripped-down body which has been reduced in weight heavily with a massive focus on increasing performance. A roll cage shows off some of the best engineering and design regarding safety the 1960s had to offer. Oh, and did we mention that this compelling drag car was made to compete by the dealership? That's right, when this racer was brand new and freshly built, the AMC was capable of running a 10.6-second quarter-mile time. Nowadays, it's a little more road worthy but still boasts that wonderful powerband that made it so great in the first place.</p>
<p>The current owner is an enthusiast whose passion for cars extends far past simple speed or raw power, though he loves those things too. On standard drives, the maximum this driver hits is around 100 miles per hour, according to the video. Drag cars don't necessarily need to be fast in terms of top speed because it's all about acceleration. Under the hood is a gigantic V8 engine with a cross-ram intake and Holley 650 Carburetors to make some serious horsepower and torque figures. That cross-ram intake benefits the high displacement V8 and significantly adds to the acceleratory ability. All in all, the best part of this video has got to be when the car starts up, and a gnarly roar pours from the tailpipes like an army ready for war. We hope to see this car in the spotlight soon, but for now, it's enough to just know it's being well cared for by a dedicated and fun-loving owner.</p>
