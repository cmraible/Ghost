<p>As we look back on 2019, one of the coolest custom vehicles we saw this year was a 2018 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Tahoe" rel="nofollow">Chevy Tahoe</a> that had been converted to resemble a classic K5 Blazer/Suburban for <a href="https://www.autoclassics.com/tag/sema/" rel="nofollow">SEMA</a>. This custom-bodied SUV is cool and all, but looking at this rig also made us reminisce about a two-door retro K5 Blazer that was built a year prior to this one for the 2018 SEMA Show. We decided to put both of them side by side to see which one was better.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/motoriousdotcom/" rel="nofollow noopener">Motorious Facebook page</a> and let us know which one of these custom K5 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet</a> creations you liked best.</p>

<p><a href="https://flatoutautos.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Flat Out Autos</a> of Jonesboro, Arkansas created a retro K5 combining elements from the sixth-gen (1967-72) K5 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Suburban" rel="nofollow noopener">Suburban</a> and first-gen (1969-72) K5 Blazer. Starting life as a brand-new 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe, this custom SUV might have more in common with the three-door Suburban of that time with the extra doors, non-removable top and the pre-Blazer front grille. The body is so retro that it creates a weird transition to the carryover components above the window line since the thick pillars and raked-back windshield are obvious design touches.</p>

<p>That Tahoe might have a vintage look, but it's missing one important thing from the K5 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Blazer" rel="nofollow">Blazer</a>: the removable hard top. Created by <a href="https://fourwaymotors.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fourway Motors</a> of Manitoba, Canada, this "Retro Blazer" is a mashup of GM's full-size trucks using the front clip of a Chevy Avalanche, the cab of a Chevy Silverado cab and the cargo box from a GMC Sierra. And it was topped with a modified – and removable – Leer truck cap.</p>
<p>You can see more images of both fully custom SEMA SUVs in the gallery below.</p>
