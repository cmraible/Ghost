The new Bronco interior features leather-trimmed seats made of cloth and marine-grade vinyl. In the four-door model, the second row seats come with a 60/40 fold, and also easily collapse to make more room for more things to bring on adventures. Because off-road adventures can bring in quite a bit of unwanted dirt, the floor is rubberized rubberized and is incorporated with drains for easy cleaning."

The vintage Bronco power-plant featured the same basic engine that powered the Falcon and Econoline models, but was topped with a different single-barrel carburetor and a stronger fuel pump. Ford decided to use the six-cylinder for economical reasons but also to keep the base model price down. However, the SUV still only averaged 14 miles per gallon, so it wasn't really economical at all. Back in March 1966, Ford made a 289-cubic-inch V8 optional."
