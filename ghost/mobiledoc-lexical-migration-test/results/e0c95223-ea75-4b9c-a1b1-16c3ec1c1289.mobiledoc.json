For example, there are good reasons to like the fifth generation Vipers. But, there’s some irony in this statement since the 1996 GTS coupe is considered a second-generation car by many, even though it was the first production year of the coupe. Obviously Leno sees it differently, but like we said, you don’t have to agree with everything the man says or does."
