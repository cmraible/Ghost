That might have helped a man in Bristol, Connecticut who reportedly was robbed at gunpoint and his 2019 Dodge Charger was taken."

Partway through the test drive the man in the back pulled out a gun and told the owner to hand the key fob over to the driver."

Likely he realized after he easily could have been kidnapped and/or killed."

          "When selling a car online, it’s best to be a little paranoid, especially since car thefts are rampant these days. Before meeting, do some research on your buyer and see if you can determine if they have a known criminal past. Also, ask plenty of questions about why they’re interested in the car, as well as the status of their driver’s license and car insurance coverage. If they’re evasive at all or give strange answers, that can be a sign something is off."

          "Meeting in a public spot, like at a police station where there’s video surveillance is ideal. Known criminals are more likely to be skittish about going to such a place. It’s best to have someone else with you, if possible. Ask to see the buyer’s driver’s license and a copy of their insurance card before you let them drive your car. While it is best to go along for the test drive, sit in the backseat for obvious reasons. Also, designate the test route before you leave and make sure it sticks to highly populated areas. If the driver deviates from the path, demand they go back to it. Don’t hesitate to call 911 if you suspect the person is attempting to rob or kidnap you."
