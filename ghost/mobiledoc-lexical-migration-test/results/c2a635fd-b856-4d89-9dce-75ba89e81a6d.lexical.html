Bentley is only the sixth 4 ½-Litre chassis built, and the first of the model to feature the now-iconic sports four-seater coachwork by Vanden Plas.

<p>Starting in 1902, Cadillac has built solid and reliable cars that were not only dependable, but also were some of the most opulent and luxurious on the road. Quite simply; for top down motoring in 1940, it didn't get any better than in a Cadillac. <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-G65IR/1940-cadillac-series-62-convertible-sedan">For sale is a nice condition Cadillac</a><br><br> that was the recipient of an earlier restoration, that still bodes well for today. Some patina, and faults are there, but we have a very fine example of the wonderful design when a Cadillac was in its heyday.</p>

<p>Founded by James Ward Packard with two partners in 1899, Packard was an American luxury automobile marque built by the Packard Motor Car Company. Packard automobiles were produced from 1899 until 1958. <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-G65IT/1934-packard-twelve-coupe">This 1934 Packard </a>Twelve Coupe is a beautifully preserved example. It's suspected that the car was originally owned by wealthy Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergrass. This car was shipped from the plant to Kansas City and the Reid Ward Motor Company so it may stand to make sense.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-G65IZ/1939-cadillac-model-75">1 of 2 Brunn Coachwork Creations</a>, only 1 survives as the other one was demolished in an incident in Florida. This particular model was one of only 13 semi-custom formal open front town cars, and this particular car has a modified fenders to match the sloping lines of the rear of the car. So now it becomes 1 of 1! The two were built for Mr. Weidner by the Hermann C. Brunn body company from Buffalo, New York. These cars were custom ordered and this order cost Weidner $27,000 each. It was the depression, and body companies were folding left and right. This order allowed the Brunn company to survive the depression.</p>
