          "Australia has made a lot of headlines lately for strict lockdown in certain areas, but what many of our readers in North America might not know is crime has been surging as well. That’s right, as the government seeks to control the movements and activities of regular citizens, violent criminals have been having run of cities like Sydney, a problem which seems to only be growing worse. This problem is perfectly illustrated by the recent torching of a stolen BMW X5 in western Sydney."

That’s shocking, but keep in mind Australia has been under strict gun control measures since the late 90s. Amazing how criminals seem to not care about laws and such."

However, surveillance footage shows two men running from the X5 as it burned. Police were sure to add the men made several attempts to light it on fire before they were successful. They probably also struggle with charcoal grilles."
