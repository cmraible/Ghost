<p>The founders of E.C.D. Automotive Design grew up in England (the Midlands) just 40 miles away from the Lode Lane factory that produced Land Rover Defenders. Founded by Tom, Elliot, and Scott, have a love for vehicles, especially classic English examples. That may be apparent by their very first cars as Elliot's was an 1987 Austin Mini and Tom's was a '67 MGB Roadster. In 2012, Tom and his wife, Emily, moved to the United States and opened a dealership to import the vehicles they were passionate about. In 2013, E.C.D. Automotive Design opened up shop with just Tom, his brother Elliot and the first employee, Brandon, spending oer 18 hours a day working hard. Now, they have a facility that is over 30,000 square feet and over 50 full-time employees that build these amazing custom builds.</p>
<p>One of their builds is this custom Defender 90 finished in a spectacular chrome with satin accents. On all four corners sit a set of satin black 16-inch Maxtracc Mach 5 wheels wrapped with Nitto Ridge Grapplers found below Spectre Edition wheel arches. The exterior also features a Warn winch for when you or your buddies get into a jam. This Defender also features 4 square LED spot lights, a custom dog platform with a ramp, roof access ladder, extended sun vision visor, and mesh guards on the side of the windows.</p>
<p>Powering this Defender is an LS3 V8 engine rated at a healthy 565-horsepower, and it has been fitted with an ECD air suspension. Stopping power is provided by big Brembo brakes with contrasting red calipers. Braided stainless steel fuel lines sit in place of the factory lines, and a Leisure battery with fans has everything starting right up.</p>
