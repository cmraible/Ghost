<p>It appears now that Google will now inform you of your current IP (Internet Protocol) Address if you query the search engine with “<a title="What is my IP?" href="http://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8&ion=1&nord=1#sclient=psy-ab&hl=en&nord=1&site=webhp&source=hp&q=what%20is%20my%20ip&pbx=1&oq=&aq=&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&fp=1a253649f8997ec7&ion=1&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=1a253649f8997ec7&biw=1800&bih=1087&ion=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is my ip</a>.”  For years, sites like WhatIsMyIP.com and <a title="IPChicken" href="http://ipchicken.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPChicken</a> would help Internet users learn their IP address — well, now they are really no longer necessary as Google looks to help inform users looking for an answer to that age-old question.</p>
<p>When you type the query into the search box, it will return your IP on top of the results and also provide a “<a title="Learn more about your IP Address" href="http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=1696588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn More</a>” link that further explains what an IP Address is and what it is used for on the Internet.  Simple, yes, but very useful.  Little things like this are why I love Google.  I’ve included a screenshot below of the feature in action.</p>
