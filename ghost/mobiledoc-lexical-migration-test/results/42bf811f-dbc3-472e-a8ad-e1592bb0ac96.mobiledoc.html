<p>The classic Dodge Challenger is an iconic car that Mopar designed to be intentionally bold, and ready to take on competitors. It was Dodge's answer to the pony car, and put Ford and GM on notice. In modern days, these cars are at the top of wish lists for American muscle car enthusiasts and car collectors. At the upcoming Carlisle Auction, two amazing examples from the 1970s will be up for grabs. Which one would you put in your garage?</p>
