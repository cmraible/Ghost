<p>This real WM23N Super Bee comes with the 383ci Magnum V8 with a mighty 335-horsepower to command. Thanks to the four-speed manual transmission, you get to row throw the gears properly, plus there’s a pistol grip for that extra cool factor. An 8 ¾ Sure Grip rear with 4.10 gears helps this car to hook up and go.</p>

<p>The budget-friendly muscle car from Dodge, the Super Bee appealed to many younger shoppers. It launched in 1968 and shared some characteristics with the Plymouth Road Runner. For the 1970 model year, Dodge redesigned the Super Bee. It was also the final year the car was based on the Coronet.</p>
