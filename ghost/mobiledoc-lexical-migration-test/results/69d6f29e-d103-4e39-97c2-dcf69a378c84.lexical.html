<p>A <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1965 Ford Mustang fastback</a> is a desirable machine any way you look at it. That's especially true when it's an ex-race car with a pedigree.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this particular Mustang</a> race car has something very special crammed between the framerails: a legendary 427 "Cammer" engine. This legendary powerplant was so dominant in NASCAR that the sanctioning body banned it after protests from Chrysler.</p>

<p>Being banned in NASCAR didn't stop <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this SOHC monster motor</a> from absolutely dominating in drag racing, though. This Mustang fastback, built in 1965 and 1966, was raced until October 17th, 1971 in the NHRA Division 5 AFX series.</p>
<p>During that period, it ran a best-of 9.97 at 137.4 MPH in Denver, Colorado. At the time, <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this muscular Mustang</a> weighed in at a lean 3,150 pounds, including the driver. </p>

<p>After its racing days were over, it sat in a building near Cheyenne, Wyoming for decades, slowly deteriorating. In June of 2000, it was found, and treated to <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a full restoration</a>.</p>
<p>The Holman-Moody-prepped, Hilborn-injected 427 SOHC engine was rebuilt, and it's still <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the original engine</a> that was used in the car from its racing days. The engine is numbered 274.</p>

<p>Since the restoration, this Mustang has never seen bad weather, and has spent its days in a garage. it's retired from competition now – and it has been for a great many years – but we'd wager that this thing could still make a pass or two <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">for old time's sake</a>.</p>
<p>This very special Mustang will be auctioned off by <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31315/1965-ford-mustang-drag-car?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a> as part of their February 2021 sale, which runs from February 25 through February 27. This one will cross the block on Saturday, and we expect this big-bore bruiser to bring the big bucks.</p>
