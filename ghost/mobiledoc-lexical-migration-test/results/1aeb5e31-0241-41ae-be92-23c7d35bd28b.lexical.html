<p>In 2018, President Donald Trump repealed key rules designed to regulate mid-sized financial institutions — such as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which last week became the second-largest bank to fail in U.S. history. Fifty congressional Democrats sided with Republicans to pass the repeal.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/powell-approved-svb-merger-insisting-bank-posed-no-systemic-risk/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/regulators-greenlit-svbs-risky-investments/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way to force those in power to do right is to continue exposing these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
