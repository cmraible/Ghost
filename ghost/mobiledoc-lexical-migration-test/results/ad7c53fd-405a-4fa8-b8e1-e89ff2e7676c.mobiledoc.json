          "Land Rover had a plan – to go after the likes of the Bentley Bentayga and the Rolls-Royce Cullinan with a high-end version of the already posh Range Rover in the range-topping SVAutobiography Dynamic flavor. More than just a two-door conversion of the luxury SUV, the SV Coupe only carried over the hood and lower half of the tailgate from the regular model and was supposed to be Range Rover’s first vehicle to ride on 23-inch wheels from the factory."

For example, walnut and sycamore woods were fused together to adorn the dashboard, center console, steering wheel, and the cargo floor."

The $295,995 opulent SUV was originally supposed to be a limited series of 999 examples, but the ultra-luxury two-door model will go down in history as a one-off affair. Land Rover has not fulfilled any of the orders received following the SV Coupe’s debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, and it doesn’t intend to put the limited-edition SUV into production."
