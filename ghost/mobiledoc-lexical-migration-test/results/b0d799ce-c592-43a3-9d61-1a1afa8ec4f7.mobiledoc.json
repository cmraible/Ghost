While learning the mechanics, I did run into a few problems, mainly how to construct a barn (but more on that later). Starting off slowly, you’ll learn how to grow crops and sell them at the market which will allow you to fix-up your old rundown farm and start making decisions to build and expand it. You’ll fix windows, dabble in interior design (which I just love in these types of games), buy seeds and plant and water them every day until they grow big and strong. These crops, as is the case for most farming simulators, can be sold for money in order to expand your farm. As you grow better crops, you’ll earn more cash and start being able to buy more luxury items from shops and markets in town. "

I know that this is a typical trait but there’s a lot left unexplained at the beginning apart from a brief overview and I found that my first few minutes was me just stumbling about attempting to grasp how things worked. My biggest issue came when I was first trying to build a barn; the game did not make it clear on how to do this properly and I spent far too much time trying to figure it out. This could have been easily fixed by a simple video tutorial or more detailed descriptions."
