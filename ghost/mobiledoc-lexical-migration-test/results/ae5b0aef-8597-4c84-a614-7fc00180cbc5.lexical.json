Sure, that's a lot but the issue is that it's twin-turbocharged and anyone who's ever really worked with that engine platform knows that it should be making a lot more with that setup. Perhaps the builder assumed the lower power would be best as the vehicle is quite light at just 2,700lbs but that would prove itself to be a bad assumption.
