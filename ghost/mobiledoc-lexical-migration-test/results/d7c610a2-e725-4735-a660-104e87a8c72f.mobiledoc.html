<hr>
<p>Camaros and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fire-kills-fourth-gen-camaro-z28/">fires</a> have become like Mustangs and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/another-mustang-power-pole/">hitting power poles</a> or Corvettes and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-hits-crowd/">horrific crashes</a>. We sadly have another incident, this one killing a second-gen in what we would call a senseless act of nature. A local news report didn’t say what the cause of the fire was and neither did the fire department.</p>

<p>With people pulling out their classic cars now that the weather has warmed up and winter is finally done, incidents like this are sadly all too common. It pays to check everything over two or three times before taking your old ride out on the open road, even if you’re just driving near home.</p>

<p>A slight fuel leak, loose wiring, or even a brake reservoir drip can cause a sudden ignition. If you smell fuel while driving or notice anything else that’s off, pull over immediately and deal with the situation cautiously.</p>
<p>It’s also worth saying that carrying a fire extinguisher in your ride isn’t paranoid, it’s smart. While one wouldn’t have extinguished this Camaro fire in the state firefighters started battling it, perhaps when the car first started smoking an extinguisher could have put a quick end to the problem.</p>

<p>Instead, this second-gen Camaro looks exactly how we don’t want our steak or burgers: well-done. Unless the owner is feeling particularly ambitious or is just super attached to the muscle car, we bet this thing is headed to the junkyard if it isn’t already there.</p>
<p>Oh and one other thing: it’s a good idea to carry insurance on your classic cars. You can get a policy designed for hobby vehicles so it’s not as expensive and coverage is better, just in case something happens even after you do everything right.</p>
