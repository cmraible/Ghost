<p>Measuring in at 60 feet high and 250 feet in length, boasting of an installed overhead missile launcher and four observation cameras, the 5000mph TV icon would make the perfect addition to any collector’s garage.</p>

<p>Except, Thunderbird 2 sadly doesn’t exist. However, what is available is this promotional vehicle built by a bodywork fabrication specialist. And what sexy vehicle is the Thunderbird 2 replica crafted from? Under the custom panels and bespoke paintwork lurks a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=1994+Toyota">1994 Toyota</a> Previa. Hot stuff.</p>
<p>While the fictional Thunderbird 2 was powered by an atomic fusion reactor and, therefore, offered an unlimited range and a cruising speed of 2000mph (alongside a top speed some 3000mph more), the real-life equivalent churns out 133bhp through a 2438cc petrol engine paired with an automatic transmission.</p>

<p>Top speed is 108mph – meaning that almost every situation requesting International Rescue will have spiralled out of control with an astronomical death rate by the time you get there.</p>
<p>The national speed limit for a factory standard version will take 13.2 seconds to reach, but we aren’t sure how the modifications affect acceleration. Yet, power doesn’t really matter, for in your head you’ll be six years old again. And that transformation is priceless.</p>

<p>Specification within the cabin includes Green seats with yellow ‘2’ motifs, a colour-coordinated dash, and a Thunderbirds bed in the rear cabin with a roof mounted DVD system so you can watch your favourite episode. Just avoid the 2004 Hollywood remake, as that is less F.A.B and more C.R.A.P.</p>
<p>Further design features include port hole side windows, a rearview camera, an incorporated sound system, and all the crowd-drawing abilities you could possibly need.</p>

As far as we are aware, it’s fully road legal (in the UK, at least).</p>
<p>As the only one in the world, if you dare to be different, then this is the perfect vehicle for you. As a school run wagon, nothing comes close. Taking your children to school in Thunderbird 2 will make you the coolest parent of all time.</p>
