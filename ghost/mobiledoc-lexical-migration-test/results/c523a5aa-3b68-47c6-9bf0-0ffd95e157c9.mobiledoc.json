When you’re driving a high-powered, rear-wheel-drive sports car and pushing the envelope, things can go sideways in a hurry. Steve, unfortunately learned this lesson the tough way because his beloved Corvette is now destroyed. At least he and his passenger weren’t hurt in the wreck."

That is one of the reasons why you take it to the track instead of driving like this on public roads. Good tracks have safety measures in place so in the unfortunate event your driving skills are outstripped, you get help right away. We’re glad these guys weren’t hurt but hope everyone can learn from these mistakes."
