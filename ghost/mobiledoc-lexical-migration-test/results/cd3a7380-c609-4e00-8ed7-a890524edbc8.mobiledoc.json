Just as one would expect, the Grantura emphasized simplicity during its production run from 1958 to 1967, setting the tone for the brand decades later. While you might expect such a fine specimen of British automotive history would be astronomically expensive to acquire, these classics are in fact surprisingly affordable."

The simple, flowing bodylines paired with minimal brightwork has aged surprisingly well over time, like a fine wine. Underneath those curvaceous fiberglass body panels is a tubular steel backbone chassis for superior rigidity, a strategy TVR used over and over in its cars for decades after."

Another dramatic improvement was the longer, stiffer chassis along with the addition of independent four-wheel suspension, improving handling quite a bit. As such, the Mark II cars are more sought after by collectors but are still well below what many of its contemporaries sell for."
