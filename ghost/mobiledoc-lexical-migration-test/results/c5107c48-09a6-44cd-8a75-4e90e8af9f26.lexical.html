<hr>
<p>A giant crane dangled the car over a 25-foot-by-50-foot reflecting pool under the Duster with 2,500 gallons of water as a crew fixed a 1975 Duster into place.</p>

<p>"It's definitely not something you see every day,” said Boyd, Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center's exhibitions manager.</p>
<p>The car will remain nose down over the pool for 8 months, being called “Breve historia del tiempo,” or “brief history of time,” which is a nod to the long history of the auto industry in OKC.</p>
<p>It was more than 20 years ago that the inspiration for the piece came to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/largest-cars-memorabilia-collection/">Mexican</a> artist, Gonzalo Lebrija.</p>
<p>"The first idea really came from a kind of dream that I had of a car falling down into a lake and just stopping at the moment it touched the water. Then this image just started to grow up in my mind until I did it," Lebrija said</p>
<p>After he had that vision, he decided to create a performance art piece using a crane to drop another Plymouth Duster into a lake in Guadalajara, Mexico. Lebrija used a high-speed camera to capture a photo of the car just before the bumper hit the water.</p>
<p>"Once I had the print of the image, the print changed the image on my conscious. ... It took over," he recalled. "In the image, you have this kind of vertigo sensation; you feel that the car really is giving you this idea of gravity force."</p>

<p>From that image came the inspiration to prop this Duster up in the pool.</p>
