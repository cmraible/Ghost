<p>You might already be aware that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mclaren/675LT" rel="nofollow">McLaren 675LT</a> is a borderline insane <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a>. What many don’t realize is even with the roof chopped off, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/175753/2016-mclaren-675lt-spider">2016 McLaren 675LT Spider</a> retains the same level of potency. This isn’t a vehicle designed for the faint of heart, but instead it’s a proper supercar which pushes the envelope in all the right ways.</p>

<p>With production limited to a mere 500 units globally, just like the 675LT Coupe, this Spider is a rare ride. It has under 5,000 miles on the odometer, which helps explain why the Mineral Gray exterior and Alcantara interior look about as clean as when this supercar was new. Making for excellent highlights are the orange brake calipers and matching accents on the seats.</p>
<p>The one and only owner ordered this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mclaren" rel="nofollow">McLaren</a> with a nice list of options, so you get to enjoy all the goodies your heart truly desires. As you can clearly see, the Carbon Fibre Exterior Upgrade Pack adds those lightweight, woven bits to boost performance and looks. Carbon fiber side intakes, super lightweight forged wheels, and a vehicle lifter are included as well. There’s also the Extended Carbon Fibre Interior Upgrade for the same look and lightweighting benefits for the cabin. You even get a parking camera, making maneuvering into spots so much less stressful.</p>
<p>This is a serious supercar for people who want to hit the track and drive hard. One of the most impressive options is the McLaren Track Telemetry Camera. It capitalizes on the 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 with a raucous 666 bhp and 516 lb.-ft. of torque on hand. That’s considerable since dry weight for the 675LT Spider is officially listed at 2,800 pounds. Push this McLaren to the limit and you’ll hit 203 mph. It’s also quick, doing 0-62 mph in just 2.9 seconds.</p>
<p>A McLaren 675LT Spider isn’t for everyone, but if you believe you can handle such a supercar, contact <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Speed+Motors+USA">Speed Motors USA</a> to make an offer.</p>
