<h2 id="activism-versus-journalism">Activism versus journalism</h2>
<p>Thanks to the recent internal clash over coverage of trans issues at the <em>New York Times</em>, the line between journalism and activism is under the microscope again. This piece gives you plenty to think about: </p>
<blockquote>We suffered from censorship and self-censorship in Nicaragua throughout the 1980s. We tried to do journalism. But politics was always in the way. I believe I only became a true journalist later, when I again faced this dilemma between journalism and politics. Then I said: “No. I don’t want to have a political career. What I want is to do journalism.”</blockquote>

<p>This is, I suspect, a conversation we need to have. Part of the erosion of trust in journalism could be attributed to the blurring of lines between reporting, activism and opinion. It won't be an easy conversation to have. </p>
<p>A counterpoint: many journalists are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/30/newsrooms-news-reporting-objectivity-diversity/">now <em>rejecting</em> objectivity as a virtue</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“The consensus among younger journalists is that we got it all wrong,” <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/emilio-garcia-ruiz/">Emilio Garcia-Ruiz</a>, editor in chief of the San Francisco Chronicle, told us. “Objectivity has got to go.”</blockquote>
<p>At what point does that just become activism in journalism's clothing? </p>
<h2 id="google-blames-canada">Google blames Canada</h2>
<p>One to watch: Google had a trial run of excluding some Canadian news sites from search results, as a little taste of what could happen if the current global move to try to force Google to pay for links to publishers accelerates. </p>
<p>I suspect Google will have very little compunction in showing how little we matter to it. </p>

<p>A worthwhile read from Craig Mod about the four years he's been running his membership scheme. It's a niche audience to be sure, but one that's working for him. And there are some more widely applicable lessons. </p>

<h2 id="media-ethics-should-oakeshott-have-handed-over-hancocks-messages">Media Ethics: should Oakeshott have handed over Hancock's messages?</h2>
<p>With apologies to non-Brits, this is an interesting one. The UK news cycle has been dominated by reporting on the private WhatsApp messages of pandemic-era UK health secretary Matt Hancock from the time of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>The catch? The journalist in question was <em>given</em> the messages by Hancock, under a non-disclosure agreement, so she could ghost-write his book. </p>
<p>Over at <em>Press Gazette, </em>Dom Ponsford almost manages to convince you that this was in the public interest, and thus ethical. <em></em></p>
