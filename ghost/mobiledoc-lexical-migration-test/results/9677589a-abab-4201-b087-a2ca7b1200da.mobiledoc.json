You may find that your competitors find ways to market themselves better and if you’re not careful you may even find that you lose out on customers as a result. If you want to avoid all of that then here are a few things that you can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn from your competition</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for ways to try and improve your ranking, then the first thing that you should do is look to your competitors. You ultimately need to find out what they are doing to try and attract customers. Of course, if you find out that you are the only one who is still using cold-calling techniques then it could be time to change this because it might not be working as well as you’d think. If you see that your competitors are always running <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-advertise-on-facebook/\">advertisements on Facebook</a> then it might be worth doing the same too. You might experience a similar level of success and you may even find that your competitor’s customers come to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coordinate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of different constraints on your time and focus while you are in business. It is critical that you make the most of both, and the best way to do that is with good coordination. You need to keep track of all the different marketing efforts that you have going on and ensure that you keep up with each of them. By being able to visualize all of them in one place, you can make the most of your limited time. Use a tool like <a href=\"https://www.crosscap.com/\">Crosscap&#8217;s</a> for the best results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get testimonials</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most customers look up reviews before they buy something. This helps them to validate their purchase. Of course, it’s possible for you to attract more <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/why-your-employees-are-key-to-customer-engagement/\">customers</a> by getting reviews from people who have purchased from you before. You can post these reviews in various places, such as on your site or even on a dedicated testimonial page. Either way, customer reviews really are critical, and they can also help to make your site much more effective in terms of conversion. Another place for you to advertise your reviews would be for you to utilize social media.&nbsp; If you aren’t sure how to encourage your clients to review, then consider offering them a reward in exchange for their opinion. This could be a deal, discount or even the chance to win a special item from your company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update your social media</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably know by now that social media marketing is imperative for your small business. If you have some social media accounts set up right now, then this is a positive first step, but you do need to make sure that you update them on a regular basis. Your information should be accurate, and you should also make sure that you add the right hours and even website too. If your social media pages are outdated, then this won’t be doing you any favors and you may even find that you lose out on customers as a result. Frequent posting shows that you are active too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get out of your store</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter whether you run your business from home or whether you have a store-front because it’s important that your customers know you and your business too. Sometimes this might mean that you have to go to them rather than waiting for them to visit you. If you want to help yourself here, then you need to work hard to try and develop your local marketing strategies and you also need to go to as many local events as you can. If you are able to get a booth or even a table then this will work wonders for your publicity. Of course, when you do go to an event it helps to bring items that will help you to sell your business. This could include business cards or even discount codes that are printed on leaflets. You can also launch new products such as showcasing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.freeman.com/work/blue-sky-thinking\">unmanned drones</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to potential clients and other event attendees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Become an expert</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily improve your business marketing efforts by positioning yourself as a local expert. Find local groups that fit within your business niche and even attend networking events too. If you are a confident person then you might also want to offer yourself up as a speaker at local events and meetings too. Another way for you to get publicity would be for you to chat with local journalists. They are usually always looking out for a story and they are also happy to work with you to make sure that your business is portrayed in a positive light.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph-1200x784.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57715\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph.jpg 1200w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph-300x196.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph-768x502.jpg 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph-370x242.jpg 370w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph-760x497.jpg 760w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/09/macbook-graph-740x483.jpg 740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Voicemail</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way for you to market your business better would be for you to text or even leave a voicemail for your customers. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.dropcowboy.com/\">ringless voicemail</a> services available and it’s never been easier for you to take advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Promotional credits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, huge advertisement campaigns might be out of your budget, but you can usually take advantage of coupons and even discounts online. This will give you the chance to get the same service for a much more affordable price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DIY infographics</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infographics are very powerful marketing tools. They are the perfect visual eye-candy and they are easy to digest too. If you want to drive referral traffic and links, then it’s always worth hiring a designer but that’s not to say that you can’t try it yourself. It can be a challenge but there are so many vector kits out there that you can use and in some instances, you can even download software too. If you have never used things like this before then it’s always worth downloading a demo so that you can try it out without too much pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Give life to old data</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your marketing budget is somewhat tight then you might not always be able to afford to hire a writer to create your content for you. This is understandable, but there are a few ways that you can work around this. One of the many things that you can do is breathe some life into something that is already on your blog. You might also want to find a study that relates to your industry, before adding your own take on it. Highlight the interesting parts and add your own images. You can also create charts that support the data too, and before you know it, you’ll easily have something that you can call your own. At the end of the day, you don’t need to be a master writer in order to pull this off because the data that you have will do most of the work for you. If you want to make sure that you don’t breach any data laws, then cite your sources properly and also make sure that you take your statistics from reputable sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn is a huge social media site that is quite often under-utilized. You should never add connections and then sign out again. Instead, you need to join groups, talk to people and socialize. You might also want to share some posts that your connections would find interesting too. This will help you to really boost your site and it is also a fantastic way for you to build your brand. If you feel as though your profile is a little lackluster then it’s a good idea for you to go through and add your level of experience and even the work that you have done in the past. It’s also worth explaining what you did in your previous roles and the types of connections that you are looking for. This will help you to make the most out of your profile and it will also help you to take your business to that next level too. Of course, when you have mastered the art of having a personal profile, you should then try and focus on creating a company profile. This is the best way for you to come across as being professional and it will also help you to increase your exposure. If you just aren’t sure how to proceed with creating a profile, then it’s a good idea for you to hire an expert to do it all for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer referral program</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that you can do is develop a quality customer referral program. Make the effort to offer all of your existing customers a free product or even a free month with your service. This will increase your word of mouth advertisement and it will also help you to increase your exposure overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Online contests</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, another way for you to get more traffic would be for you to host an online contest. This will cost you but at the end of the day it is a fantastic way for you to develop some new leads. One way for you to make this cheaper for yourself would be for you to put up some of your own products for the giveaway. You’ll be losing out on less money by doing this and it is also a fantastic way for you to increase your product awareness too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of ways for you to really boost your online presence and when you follow the above tips, you’ll soon find that it is easier than ever for you to increase your brand image. If you need some additional help, then it is always a good idea for you to hire a reputable marketing service as they can talk you through everything you could ever need to know.<br></p>\n"
