Even this bike was not without its mechanical issues. On his third lap, a particularly hard landing from the jump at Ballig Bridge stripped second gear, rendering it inoperable. Welsby then had to remain in top gear and seriously abuse the clutch on the slower portions of the course. He still managed to finish 18th overall, hitting 92.2 mph on the Sulby Straight and 107 mph on the drop to Hillberry despite the bike's issues."
