Although every chapter maintains a high level of quality in its essential aspect, not all of them are given an equal share of care. Some chapters give the players almost total freedom to explore, play with different game mechanics and immerse themselves in the world and its possibilities, whereas other chapters follow a much more linear and stiff path without a lot of wriggle room for the player to choose how they would like to best approach the situation, and sometimes even elements such as the story pacing suffer for it. Although at no point does this make for a bad or ruined chapter, it is a shame to think what some of the less-fortunate chapters could have been if they aimed to give the player as much wriggle room as some of the others. It is always clear which chapter will be the most fun to return to in subsequent playthroughs, and which offer the most depth in terms of gameplay and story."

          " isn’t much to write home about - until the last few hours, that is. The game is at no point so easy as to be boring, and always has something to keep the player focused, but the encounters rarely provide a real challenge until the last few hours of the game when combat suddenly starts to require more careful planning. Not quite a difficulty spike, but a steep slope that could have been eased on earlier for a more enjoyable experience. As it is, it is perfectly viable to play through most of the game without engaging with its combat mechanics on a deeper level; rather than attempting to interrupt attacks and position your character out of harm’s way, it is always easier to simply get within hitting range and wail on the enemies."
