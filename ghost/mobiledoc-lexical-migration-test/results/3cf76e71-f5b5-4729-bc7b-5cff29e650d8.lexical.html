<p>• <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/22/lehigh-valley-pennsylvania-democratic-party-biden/"><strong>Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party Isn’t Ready For This Fight, but Its People Might Be</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>“Polls have begun to show clearly that if everybody who plans to vote is able to, Biden has the upper hand. But particularly in Pennsylvania, that’s far from guaranteed, and Republicans have been working overtime to make sure it’s not the case. That could turn Pennsylvania’s election into a street brawl, and it’s one that progressives worry the state party simply isn’t built for.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-isn-t-why-trump-losing-seniors-support-it-isn-ncna1242672"><strong>Covid isn't why Trump is losing seniors' support. But it isn't helping him.</strong></a> (NBC News) — <em>“The current thinking is that President Donald Trump and the Republican Party are faring so poorly with America's senior voters because of their response to Covid-19 — in particular, the president's severely inadequate actions and policies, as well as how seniors are among the most vulnerable populations in this pandemic. However, that is a false assumption: The shift by seniors away from Trump and the GOP began — at the very latest — in 2018, long before the pandemic.”</em></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota-"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As I write this, my state is facing the largest fires in its history — here in Denver, you can smell the smoke as it wafts all over the state. The scent of burning trees is a reminder of the climate emergency so many communities are facing — and how pathetic it is that there is about to be another climate denier added to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>We’ve spent a lot of time reporting on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s <a href="/barrett-doubles-down-on-climate-denial/">climate denialism</a> and her <a href="/in-pipeline-case-barrett-could-boost/">familial</a><a href="/upcoming-scotus-climate-case-involves/">ties</a> to the fossil fuel companies and lobby groups that have cases before the Supreme Court. I’m proud that our small team has broken open these original stories and have helped lead the climate-related coverage of the confirmation battle, but I’m also disgusted that climate change has not been more of a central story in the national media discourse about the nomination. There have certainly been a few stories — but for the most part, climate has not taken center stage, which is another softer form of climate denial.</p>
<p>I don’t know what it will take for climate change to be a dominant storyline in our politics and media. The country is being incinerated by this crisis, and it is still treated as a secondary story, rather than the central story of our age. I know that <em>The Daily Poster</em> will continue to treat this story with the gravity and importance it deserves — we’re not going to let up.</p>
<p>This coming week, we will have an exclusive interview with the lead attorney in one of the major climate cases coming before the Supreme Court. We also should have a few final election-related stories that follow the money.</p>
<p>For the next 10 days, you’ll likely be told that we must continue to wait until after the election to demand anything from Democrats. Then almost immediately after the election is over, you’ll probably start being told that you’ll have to wait until after the 2022 election to demand anything from Democrats.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these self-serving declarations are a bunch of bullshit — we should always be allowed to ask elected officials of both parties to deliver on their promises. While I’ve said before that I’m voting to defeat Trump, I’ve also said our reporting will not be deterred by those in power who want us to shut up. We’re not shutting up — we are going to keep scrutinizing and challenging power, whether power likes it or not.</p>
<p>With your support, we’ve done that before the election and we will do that after the election. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
