<p>Buddy Baker was the first driver to go around the Nascar track at speeds of over 200-mph and the car that allowed him to do that was created using NASA technology. Chrysler aerospace engineers took data and telemetry equipment that was developed for NASA and applied it to <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4969/1969-dodge-charger-daytona-hardtop">the Dodge Charger</a>. The result was a 200-mph force to be reckoned with: The Dodge Charger Daytona.</p>

<p>The car looked like nothing anyone had ever seen before, with a cone shaped nose, a 23-inch tall spoiler, and two fender mounted cooling vents. Although, its appearance was very intentional, which proved to be very successful on the racetrack. In fact, it was so successful on the track that NASCAR disqualified it from competing in the 1971 year racing season. </p>

<p>What this meant for the <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4969/1969-dodge-charger-daytona-hardtop">1969 Dodge Charger Daytona</a> is that only 503 examples were made. 70 of them were powered by a 426-cid HEMI, 433 featured a 440-cid Magnum engine, and less than half of them came equipped with the coveted 4-speed manual transmission. So, finding a HEMI, 4-speed example today might seem impossible and, if you throw in a limited production color code like A4 Silver Poly, even a 440-cid, 4-speed car may seem unattainable.</p>
