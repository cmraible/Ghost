<p>The old joke is that Ford stands for “Found On Road Dead.” While that might be a funny little jab Chevy and Mopar guys use against their Blue Oval friends, what we have here with this 1976 Ford Bronco is pretty close. At first glance, it’s obvious this old off-roader has been sitting out in the elements for some time, what with the healthy patina some would absolutely kill to own and all. Even the windows are just absolutely filthy as this thing has just sat.</p>

<p>According to Jennings Motor Sports, which filmed the resurrection of this Bronco, it hadn’t been started in 21 long years. Sure, we’ve seen cars which have sat for several decades started for the first time, but it’s still entertaining to see these guys get this ol’ rig rolling once more.</p>

<p>With a 302ci V8 under the hood and three on the tree, three flat tires, a trashed cab, plus some body damage, this Bronco should be worth a pretty penny. You might be shaking your head at that fact, but a lot of people are nostalgic about the old Broncos these days, especially with the new ones now out. That’s especially true of these first-gen examples, even if they are in less-than-stellar shape.</p>

<p>Getting this thing running is quite the task. After all, some of the ignition wires are missing, there are dirt clods in the air cleaner, the negative battery terminal connection is just gone, etc. All of those things are pretty easily overcome, but there are more hidden challenges as the resurrection process moves forward. On the bright side of things there’s no need to worry about water sitting in the gas tank since the tank is completely rusted out.</p>
