At first glance it doesn’t look like a gearhead house, greeting you with impressive modern architecture with a clear connection to the past. However, hiding away are enough parking spots to stash a total of 36 cars without eating into the substantial living and entertaining spaces."

Instead, they’re greeted by the three covered parking spots, perfect for when your buddies drop by for longer visits. A three-car garage off the first-level mudroom allows for the stashing of your current rotation of daily drivers."

There are two separate parcels included in the sale, one measuring 5.3 acres and the other coming in at 5.13 acres. Really, it’s the kind of place where you can live without staring at other people, but you could have a bunch of friends and their friends all come over and easily accommodate everyone."
