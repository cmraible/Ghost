A new mechanic was also added which allows you to throw the eggs at the cost of ink, equivalent to using your sub weapon. This brings forth more tactics and is a welcome addition to the mode."

This time, the Octopass Expansion method of levels having set weapons, costing a currency and rewarding more of said currency has been adopted. It's a much welcomed change as level design is now focused specifically around these weapons, with some really unique and memorable levels. The boss battles are sufficiently challenging but accessible for newer players, and I’d be remiss not to mention the homage to a Super Mario Sunshine level which was just a delight to experience. In addition, the final boss provided an epic experience with great music and true levels of hype when Calamari Inkantation started to play."

The premise is simple: capture the most spaces with ink, but you can't overlap spaces and the piece that you play has to be in a single space adjacent from a piece of your own. It's a really fun and unique game mode, if only it wasn't so difficult to get more card packs. There is a quick travel option, but it strangely doesn’t go to the Tableturf section, which was an odd choice, to say the least. I seriously hope this gets a spin- off mobile app, with refinement to the rules, cards, and maps."
