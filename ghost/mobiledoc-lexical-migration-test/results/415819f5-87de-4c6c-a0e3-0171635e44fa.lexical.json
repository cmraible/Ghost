They even confirmed that that they are currently in talks with Nintendo to bring the game over, so at least we know that the wheels are in motion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same interview, Inaba stated that they see Bayonetta 3 is a turning point for the series. They really want to ‘&#8230;do something new, add in new gimmicks, new ways to play the game’.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what do you think of The Wonderful 101 potentially coming to the Switch? And what do you think about the new changes that they want to implement in Bayonetta 3? Let us know in the comment section below.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1702\" style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1702\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1702\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bayonetta-3-656x386.jpg?resize=656%2C386\" alt=\"Bayonetta 3\" width=\"656\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bayonetta-3-656x386.jpg?resize=656%2C386&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bayonetta-3-656x386.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit Nintendo</p></div></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more Nintendo updates, be sure to like our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook Page </a>and follow us on Twitter @switchaboonews.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"http://switchaboo.com/2018/04/04/nintendo-show-off-new-characters-in-splatoon-2s-octo-expansion/\">why not check out the new characters shown in Splatoon 2&#8217;s Octo Expansion?</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/rebootdevelop\">Source</a></p>\n"
