Laser-etched onto the front tunnel is a silhouette of the Bonneville rocket. Plus, there’s a clock next to the touchscreen which has some of the designs from the old car’s instrument panel. Even the yellow and black accents are a callback to the colorway for the Thunderbolt. On the driver’s door panel are the ribbon colors signifying the various honors Eyston achieved during his life."

As for the interior, it contains a few connections to the landscape, like the dashboard and part of the center console engraved with what looks like cracked ground of the Salt Flats. The Starlight Headliner in the Wraith has been configured to show what the nighttime sky looked like over Bonneville when Eyston made his final record run in 1938."
