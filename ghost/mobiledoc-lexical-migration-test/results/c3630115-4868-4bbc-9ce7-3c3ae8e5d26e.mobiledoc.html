<p>Enjoyed by only two owners, and with only 880 miles on the clock, this example is a part of the Ford's homage to the brand's colorful racing history. The retro styled Ford GT celebrated the GT40 program. </p>
<p>When Ford came up with the idea to release a street legal supercar under their moniker, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0029-2006-ford-gt-heritage/820351??utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">they were inspired by</a> the iconic GT40, four time consecutive champion of the "24 Hours of Le Mans." The rare race livery of the Heritage Edition was inspired by the double-Le Mans–winning GT40 of 1968 and 1969 which famously featured Gulf Oil sponsorship.</p>

<p>Moving the art in motion is a Lysholm twin-screw supercharged 5.4-liter DOHC V8. The mid-engine powertrain funnels 550-horsepower and 500 ft/lbs of torque through a Ricardo six-speed manual transmission, and gives the car the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour in approximately 3.3-seconds, with a top speed of almost 200 mph.</p>
