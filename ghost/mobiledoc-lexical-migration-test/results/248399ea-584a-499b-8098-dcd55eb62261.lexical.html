<hr>
<p>Naming your car is a natural thing to do. Back in the days before cars people named their horses (we hear that’s still a thing in equestrian circles) so it’s fitting to do the same thing with your faster pony car like this <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10877&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2014 Ford Mustang Roush</a>. Since this machine is green and has been tuned by Roush for more power, it’s only fitting that it’s nicknamed the Hulk. There’s even a portrait of the big green guy on the underside of the hood and the name is embroidered on the seatbacks. Even better, you could harness the brutal power of the Hulk since the car is available through <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/default.aspx?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Carlisle Auctions</a> as part of its Fall Auction.</p>

<p>Speaking of power, this Roush Mustang is pushing a stage three supercharged setup with 685-horsepower on tap. That’s way more than a stock 2014 GT makes, and that amazing performance is celebrated on the side graphics for all to see. A six-speed manual with a short throw shifter helps you get through the gears quickly for truly rocking performance. There’s also a Borla exhaust to add that aggressive snarl everyone loves to hear, especially in tunnels.</p>

<p>That wonderful Got to Have It Green paint really makes this Mustang stand out from the crowd. It’s a rare color you don’t see too much, plus the black accents make it really pop. Punching it up further are the body-color quarter window louvres and “Hulk” printed in the same color in big block letters on the tire sidewalls. Under the hood you’ll find green hoses and components painted to match the body. The black leather interior even features green accents on the door panels and seats, plus green accent stitching.</p>
