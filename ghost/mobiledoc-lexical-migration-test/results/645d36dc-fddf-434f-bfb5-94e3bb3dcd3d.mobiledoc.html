<p>The '79 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am up for grabs has been fully restored and is equipped with the Special Edition Y84 package that is loaded with everything one would expect a Bandit Trans Am to have. This distinctive muscle car is powered by a numbers-matching 403-cubic-inch V-8 engine and is shifted by an automatic transmission that twists a 2.41 rear axle. Even more, power brakes bring everything to a halt, and power steering allows easily maneuvering of those corners. Inside the car sits a black vinyl standard interior complete with an AM/FM radio and air conditioning.</p>
<p>A low-mileage example, only 37,000 miles grace the clock on this vintage Firebird TA. The exterior was sprayed in a show-worthy black-and-gold paint by Classic Pontiac Rescue, and restoration parts were provided by Ames Performance Engineering. Even more, it sits on factory-issued Snowflake wheels wrapped with reproduction Goodyear rubber all provided by Kelsey Tire.</p>
<p>“I know what an important part the <em>Smokey and the Bandit</em> movie has played in the lives of so many of my fans.”— Burt Reynolds (2015)</p>
