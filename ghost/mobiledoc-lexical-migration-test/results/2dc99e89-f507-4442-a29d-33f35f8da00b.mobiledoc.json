After realizing it had been a while since he dropped off the car to have the carburetor fixed, Attride called Resnick after he saw renovation work being done at the shop, realizing something wasn’t right, but the mechanic said he had no idea what happened to the vehicle. Yes, that’s the moment when panic and rage converge for any car owner, especially when the vehicle in question has tremendous sentimental value, which this one did since it was his late father’s car."

He also claims the Maserati was dropped off at his shop in 2018, but Attrirde says it was left there in 2020. This highlights the importance of documenting everything you do with your mechanic, including when you drop off your vehicle. That and staying up-to-date on what progress is or is not being made regularly."
