<hr>
<p>This probably isn't the highest mileage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/honda-nsx-type-s/">Honda NSX</a> around, as the host of the video below suggests — it is, however, impressive that this NSX has its original clutch, flywheel, suspension, and even bushings, with 170,000 miles already on the clock.</p>

<p>This particular example is an exceptionally well-taken care of budget exotic, which might be due to the fact that the owner runs a detailing shop, but it’s also never needed major mechanical work.</p>
<p>The 2002 year model NSX was hanging out at Minutia Detailing, where the owner of both shop and car explains how he got his hands on the NSX.</p>
<p>Current owner Mike bought the car from the second owner, and the first owner was world-famous racing driver Jenson Button, winner of the 2009 Formula 1 world title. Button drove the NSX as a company car when he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-racing-honda-civic/">raced for Honda</a>.</p>
<p>When Mike found the car for sale and clocked who its famous original owner was, he jumped on the deal. Since buying it, he’s put it to good use as a daily driver, and states that he’s never had any issues out of the car. This Honda NSX is not only a daily driven car, Mike also takes it out to the track for events on a regular basis.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZMvNKQZ6kQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
