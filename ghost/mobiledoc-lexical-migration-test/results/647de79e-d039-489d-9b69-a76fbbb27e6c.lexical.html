<p>If you like Mopar you may be dreaming about driving a Charger or Challenger. Modern muscle or old school original, these are great cars with plenty of American muscle but few examples compare to the <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">1969-½ 'lift-off' hood Super Bee</a>. Built off the Coronet platform, the Dodge Super Bee was the muscle car of all muscle cars and when mixed with the A-12 performance package, this limited production model for the 1969-½ year was taken to the next level. Only 153 were even made, making <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">this dream car</a> seem unattainable, but now you can win this fully restored example with only 27,000 original miles on the clock. </p>
