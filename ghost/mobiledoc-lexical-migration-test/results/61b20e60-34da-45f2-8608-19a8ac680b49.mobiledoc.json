Mixed with racing expertise and a design ahead of its time, Steve Saleen created  a record-holding supercar-based track beast that started 235 times and took home 118 poles, 154 podiums, 78 wins, and 10 GT Championships. Included in that is a class victory at 24 Hours of Le Mans. Here we have a stunning yet potent "

Making this example even rare is the fact that it was equipped the Saleen Competition Package. The package included the powerful Saleen-specific 427cui V8 engine equipped with an uprated camshaft, upgraded intake manifold, exhaust, and ECU. With all these things combined, this S7 was given a healthy output of 550-horsepower. However, this package wasn't cheap at an additional $75,000 over a base S7 model."

Inside, larger custom seats were installed for better comfort and a set of 6-point harnesses. The sale of the car will come with the original seats and seatbelts if the owner wishes to put the car back to stock. Other highlights include a paint protective film, optional chrome wheels, upgraded factory touchscreen sound system (not operational), remote door openers, and comes complete with Steve Saleen's autograph. This S7 has a clean CARFAX history report, and it will come with all maintenance records."
