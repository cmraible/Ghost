One of the most interesting facts is that the whole Hurst/Olds transformation process was kept far from the eyes of General Motors. Demmer Engineering in Lansing kept everything private, and once the special-ordered Cutlass 442s rolled off the line, they were secretly transported to Demmer's parking lot just a few miles away where they were transformed into the rare high-performance machine we all know and love. Another unique fact is that the 442s rolled off the line with sequential VINs, but Demmer would convert them non-consecutively. So, there are Hurst/Olds with lower VINS than this fine example, but this one is the first one to receive the works by Demmer.
