His connections to Southern California car culture and beyond give him access to plenty of amazing builds. However, some of the most epic he’s ever profiled are of course American muscle cars. And a fair number of them either sport of supercharger or turbo setup."

There are Chevelles, Hellcat-swapped classic Mopars, LS-swapped C10s, and even a Buick Regal Turbo thrown into the mix. You get to see plenty of burnouts and hear the force-fed motors really roar."

What it all boils down to is preference since superchargers and turbos have their benefits and drawbacks. It even comes down to the specific applications and setups, if we’re being completely honest. But others want to talk in broad generalisms while arguing emotions, the thing facts don’t really care about."
