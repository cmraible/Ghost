<p>The past few years have seen a dramatic rise in the importance of social video for both marketing, communications and news organisations - and in jobs for creators skilled in producing it. Social video drives huge engagement on social channels - and is a vital method of reaching the mobile phone native, whose news and information flows to them through feeds. No wonder many publishers are making it a major priority in the coming months.</p>
<p>However, it’s a very different format to the video we’ve seen (and produced) in the past. It’s less an abbreviated form of TV video and more an evolution upwards of Gifs and other short internet visuals, and that means a whole new set of skills and approaches are needed to make compelling social videos that readers want to watch - and to share.</p>
<p>This intensive course in social video is led by Adam Tinworth, a visiting Lecturer at City, University of London, whose students have gone on to lead social video from Mail Online, The LAD Bible and the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>The course does NOT presume previous video editing experience - it will walk you through the basic skills needed using freely available tools. At the end of the day you’ll have the confident - and practical experience - to start producing your own social video quickly and efficiently. </p>
