<p>As Republicans continue to <a href="https://gop.com/research/bidens-handout-to-the-rich-bailing-out-their-student-debt-rsr/">portray</a> student debt relief as a giveaway to affluent Democrats, new Federal Reserve data show the opposite: The relief would disproportionately help low- and middle-income communities, and especially benefit many Republican states whose GOP officials have been insisting debt forgiveness <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/home/news/2022/09/29/attorney-general-schmitt-five-other-states-file-suit-challenging-biden-administration-s-student-loan-cancellation-program">“will unfairly burden working class families</a>,” as Missouri’s Republican attorney general put it. </p>
<p>On Thursday, six Republican-led states <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-health-lawsuits-covid-missouri-862d783188de45b698c54b00820d3616">filed a lawsuit</a> to try to block the Biden administration’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 of borrowers’ federal student debt. The lawsuit comes after one federal student debt servicer, Maximus, has poured more than $1 million into Republican state campaigns in the last three years.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/09/revisiting-federal-student-loan-forgiveness-an-update-based-on-the-white-house-plan/">Federal Reserve study</a> shows that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-health-lawsuits-covid-missouri-862d783188de45b698c54b00820d3616">five of the six</a> Republican states filing the lawsuit would have among the largest shares of their adult populations benefiting from the program.</p>
<p>Overall, the Fed analysis finds that nearly three-quarters of the loan forgiveness will go to those living in areas where the median household income is below $83,000 a year.</p>
<p>“The average forgiveness amount makes up nearly two-thirds of the average balance in the lowest income areas,” the researchers found, adding that borrowers in lower- and middle-income neighborhoods “are more likely to have their loans completely forgiven by the plan.”</p>

<p>Evaluating the average amount of debt forgiven per borrower, the analysis finds that five out of the six states that would benefit the most are Republican strongholds: South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia. Eight of the 10 states with the highest average amount of per-borrower debt forgiveness are red states.</p>
<p>It’s the same story when comparing shares of the adult population that would receive debt relief: 17 out of the 32 states with the highest share are Republican, and three of the four that top the list are the GOP strongholds of Alabama, South Carolina, and Ohio.</p>
