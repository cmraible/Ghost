The result is a hellacious beast that does not disappoint. However, the execution is a bit more complicated."

Finishing off the subtly extreme carbon-fiber bodywork is a set of 20-inch HRE Series C105 forged three-piece wheels wrapped in high-performance 315/30ZR20 Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. This car really exemplifies what SpeedKore does best which is to make minimalist design changes while reducing weight and increasing power. Additionally, its finishing process is nothing short of breathtaking."
