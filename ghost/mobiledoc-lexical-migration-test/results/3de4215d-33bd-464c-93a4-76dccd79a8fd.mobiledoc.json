          "Fox Body Mustangs seem to be particularly controversial among enthusiasts. While many find them to be a bright spot in a largely dull car scene in the 1980s, others think they’re ugly and long overstayed their time in the Ford lineup. We don’t expect those in the latter camp will be much impressed by this turbocharged 1984 ‘Stang even though it pushes a mighty 800-horsepower and that’s okay because the world of automotive enthusiasm is big enough for all kinds of tastes."

          "Brought to us by YouTuber GearHead704, this Fox Body is one bad pony. As you can guess just from the power output, this Mustang is far from factory spec. In fact, it started out life as a lowly four-cylinder car but now has a 5.8-liter V8 with a Borg Warner S480 bolted up. The owner used a 357ci small block Ford V8 for this project, adding aftermarket internals and about 18 lbs. of boost."
