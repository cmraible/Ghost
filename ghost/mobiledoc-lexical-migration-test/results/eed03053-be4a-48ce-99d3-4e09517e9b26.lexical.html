<p>The freshman congressman talks about the latest efforts to hold these giant railroad companies accountable, the runaway deregulation that has put communities at risk, and his hopes for bipartisan movement toward fixing the real problems. In fact, just after taping this interview, Deluzio and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-following-disastrous-train-derailment-east-palestine-khanna-deluzio">introduced a bill</a> to tighten safety regulations on trains hauling “high-hazard” flammable materials.</p>
