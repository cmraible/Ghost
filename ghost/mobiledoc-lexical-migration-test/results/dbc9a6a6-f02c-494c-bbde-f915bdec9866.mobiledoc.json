That's because this Chevelle is powered by the 450-horsepower LS6 V8 (later used in the '70 Chevelle), which is backed by a four-speed Muncie M20 manual transmission sending all that power to the rear tires through a new posi-trac rear end. Best of all, this Chevelle has been driven less than 2,000 since its restoration."
