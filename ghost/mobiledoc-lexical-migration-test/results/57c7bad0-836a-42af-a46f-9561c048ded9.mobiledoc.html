<p>It’s certainly no secret that fashion icon <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/magnus-porsche/">Magnus Walker</a>is a huge Porsche fan. He has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/magnus-walkers-porsche/">an impressive collection</a> and has dutifully recruited others to full dedication toward <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-the-official-porsche-birthday-party-unfold/">the German automaker</a>. His love for Porsches of course <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">focuses on the 911</a> but in the video accompanying this post you see him preach the virtues of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/news-porsche-911-turbo-s-is-an-instant-collectible/">Turbo models</a>.</p>

<p>Not everyone is a fan of 911 Turbos. For some, forced induction is “cheating” or it doesn’t keep the cars “pure.” It’s fine if you <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-porsche-911-gt3-rs-approach-its-official-top-speed/">prefer a GT3</a> or other models with natural aspiration, but for Walker the Turbo models hold a special fascination.</p>
<p>Instead of making some long, eloquent argument for why Porsche 911 Turbo models are so great, Walker gives us some astounding footage of him driving a 1975 Turbo and a 2021 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/news-porsche-911-turbo-s-is-an-instant-collectible/">Turbo S</a>. For added interest, the film is shot on twisting, winding mountain roads.</p>
<p>For Walker, his love affair with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1997-porsche-911-is-the-perfect-90s-german-sports-car/">Porsche 911</a> Turbos began in 1977 at the ripe age of 10 when he saw a Martini-striped 930 Turbo. It’s an affinity many others share because they find something magical about forced induction coupled with that rear-mounted flat-six engine. Sure, some might call such a vehicle design suicide, and in the hands of an inexperienced driver the older 911 Turbos probably are just that, but that’s part of the appeal.</p>
<p>About 15 years after seeing that first 911 Turbo, Walker finally acquired his first Porsche. He didn’t stop there, using his growing wealth as a fashion designer to acquire an estimated $7.5 million Porsche collection. The most famous of his cars is the 1971 Porsche 911 T nicknamed “277,” which has even been made into a Hot Wheels toy.</p>
<p>As you might already well know, Walker doesn’t just collect Porsches, he’s also a fabricator. Using his unique design flair and intimate knowledge of the cars, from Los Angeles he churns out some of the most desirable rebel 911s on the market,</p>
