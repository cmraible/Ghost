<p>In other words, this is a car which will open doors of opportunity. You could take it to CCCA events and other places which normally would be closed off.</p>
<p>Of course, this is one dramatic-looking classic, with many agreeing it’s one of the most striking designs out of pre-WWII cars. Like many automobiles of the time, the front grille is stately while the pontoon front fenders offer some curvaceous appeal. What really makes a statement is that daring boattail rear, communicating the power of this machine.</p>

<p>Hidden away under the engine cowling is a flathead inline eight-cylinder Lycoming Supercharged engine, which for its time was quite the premiere powerplant. Thanks to the advanced design of this Auburn, it wowed automotive fans by being able to drive at 100 mph for sustained distances, a feat its competitors couldn’t replicate. A plaque on the dash testifies that this Speedster can hit 100.1 mph. A three-speed syncromesh transmission sends power to the Columbia two-speed rear.</p>
