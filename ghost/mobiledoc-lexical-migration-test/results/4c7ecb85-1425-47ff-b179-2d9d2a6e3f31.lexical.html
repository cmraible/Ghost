<p>This factory built <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/166998/1965-superformance-gt40-mki-wide-body-p2367">Superformance GT40 MK1</a> was made to recreate the original GT40 that took down Ferrari during the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1966. The designers developed this car with so much attention to detail that it’s actually legally allowed to be called a GT40 by name, and most of the parts are interchangeable with the original cars. Not only that, it’s eligible for the official GT40 registry and has a GT40/P chassis number P2367.</p>
