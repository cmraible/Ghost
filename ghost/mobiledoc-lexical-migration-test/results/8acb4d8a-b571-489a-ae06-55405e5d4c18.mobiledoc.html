<p>People <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/abandoned-1970-ford-mustang-mach-1-rescued-from-field/">essentially give up on cars all the time</a>. Maybe they intended to fix whatever was wrong with them, but then something happened that stopped them. Or maybe they’re the ultimate procrastinators. It’s even possible they’re just a car hoarder. We’re not sure what the case is with this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1968-plymouth-gtx-the-gentlemans-muscle-car/">1968 Plymouth</a> GTX 426 Hemi <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/barn-find-1970-plymouth-cuda-roller-under-11k/">barn find</a>, a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> which literally sat in a barn for a decade.</p>
<p>First off, the poor GTX looks like it was left untouched for more than ten years, but maybe it was a particularly dusty barn. Or it could’ve been kept in an open field first, then transferred to the barn. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/look-on-in-horror-at-these-12-valuable-barn-find-cars/">People do weird things with cars</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard life, pretty much <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-a-jeep-wrangler-yj-get-a-deep-cleaning/">every square inch of this car is filthy</a>. There’s also some corrosion and crustiness on the body and we’ll just assume the chassis looks about the same, if not worse. That said, this muscle car is almost completely original, a big plus for its value.</p>
<p>Not only does this Plymouth have the illustrious 426ci Hemi V8, backing that up is a 4-speed gearbox. The previous owner installed a nice big aftermarket tach on the left side of the steering column. Maybe this was fitted with slicks and raced at a local strip? It’s possible. All that power in a relatively <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/gordon-murrays-car-collection/">lightweight car</a> means you can really get this coupe moving.</p>
<p>Just remember there was also a 440 Super Commando available for 1968. People get very heated discussing (arguing) over which engine is better and why. Notice we didn’t take a side, even though someone will probably claim we did in the comments below.</p>
<p>It was the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-plymouth-road-runners/">Plymouth Road Runner</a> which was the budget-friendly drag racer. However, if you wanted a little bit of comfort in your muscle car, the GTX was a good option. Again, everyone has their opinion about which is better.</p>

<p>Also in this video is a yard with a few dozen barn-find-condition <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">Mopars</a> scattered about. Some are in the middle of being restored and others are actually for sale.</p>
