<p>Rear-wheel drive, mid-engined, two-seater roadsters don’t come much smaller than Japan’s <a href="https://jspecauto.com/en/honda/complete-cars/926/1991honda-beat-tastefully-modified-jdm-kei-car/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Honda Beat</a>. Perhaps the dictionary definition of ‘Kei Car’ (‘light automobile’, or <em>keijidōsha</em>), the über-waif look Sportster measures 3.3 meters in length with a kerb weight of only 760kg. That’s half the bulk of a BMW Z8.<br><br><em><strong>More Japanese Greats!</strong></em><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/304556/why-the-mazda-mx-5-miata-is-still-an-icon-30-years-on">Why The Mazda MX-5 Miata Is Still An Icon 30 Years On</a><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/349727/this-is-why-we-love-the-mazda-rx-7">This Is Why We Love The Mazda RX-7</a><br><br>As such, <a href="https://jspecauto.com/en/honda/complete-cars/926/1991honda-beat-tastefully-modified-jdm-kei-car/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the Honda’s</a> miniature 656cc, 65-horsepower, three-cylinder engine can propel two people to 60mph in 13 seconds, and onwards to a limited top speed of 84 mph. That may sound lackluster on paper, especially when compared to the Z8's gruff power, but when piloting something of this size, speed quickly becomes magnified tenfold. You’ll feel as though you’ve breached Mach 1 upon selecting fourth gear.</p>

There are 63,000 kilometers recorded on the clock and a host of tastefully modified bodywork panels. From the aftermarket front bumper to new side-skirts and a version Z wing, this <em>kei car</em> has been given an altogether more menacing look. <br><br>For a sunbaked car of its age, the paintwork remains in impressive condition with minimal imperfections. The cabin and drivetrain also boast of rude health, with the Watanabe wheels and Bridgestone Potenza RE71r tires complementing a somewhat aggressive appearance.</p>

<p>This particular <a href="https://jspecauto.com/en/honda/complete-cars/926/1991honda-beat-tastefully-modified-jdm-kei-car/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1991 Honda Beat</a> is also fitted with Todyer HID headlights, adjustable Blitz coil overs, and an almighty aftermarket exhaust. Adding these aspects to the already established handling abilities and a 5-speed manual transmission, this convertible should prove incredibly entertaining to drive around in. <br><br>The cabin features a Momo steering wheel and an aftermarket gauge cluster that goes to a (rather hopeful) 200km/h. There is also an aftermarket bolstered racing seat on the driver’s side. As an added bonus, the audio system includes a CD changer for a proper blast of nostalgia. <br><br>Interested?
