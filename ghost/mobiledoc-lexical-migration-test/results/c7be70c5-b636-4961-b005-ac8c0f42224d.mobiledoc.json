Call it a tribute, an homage, a love letter; call it what you like but I often find the key with these games is to offer something original rather than merely being a straight-copy of the game that has inspired it. Let's see if Ocean’s Heart achieves that!"

Even worse is that the bosses are even more non-existent. The ‘bosses’ that you do come across are mainly mini-bosses that can be killed with your sword in less than a minute. This sounds like a humble brag on my part but trust me, I’m not a particularly skilled gamer. Coupled with the ease at which you can farm crowns (which is the in-game currency) and health items, it means that if you do find yourself in any peril with the ‘bosses’, you could easily heal yourself with no stress.
