<p>So, the thing that seperates journalists from the blogger pack is reliability, accuracy, research and fact-checking, right?</p>

<div>So, how come [this happens](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=45155)?</div>
<div></div>><div>“Girl with a One Track Mind” blogger and author Zoe Margolis has said she is taking legal action against the Independent on Sunday after she was referred to as a “hooker” in a headline.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Note to subs: [Girl with the One Track Mind](http://girlwithaonetrackmind.blogspot.com/) and [Belle de Jour](http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/) are different blogs…</div>
<div></div>
<div>Still, that sort of mistake is a one off, right? [***Wrong***](http://westendwhingers.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/really-old-like-moira-stuart/)**.**</div>
<div></div>><div> Despite us patiently explaining who we were and why we were there ITN’s “journalist” and idiot Phil Reay-Smith went on to describe the Whingers as “die hard *Phantom *fans”. Lawyers have been advised as this is clearly defamation of the most serious kind.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Only one response is possible:</div>
