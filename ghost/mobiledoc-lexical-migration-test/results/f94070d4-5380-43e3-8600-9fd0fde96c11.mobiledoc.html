<hr>
<p>Many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1969-camaro-back/">classic car owners</a> worry their beloved ride is a little too easy of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-steals-classic-cars/">target for thieves</a> and, as you’re about to see, they’re <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-ford-mustang-stolen/">right to be concerned</a>. We’re not about getting people worked up about nothing or upsetting readers just to make them emotional. The point of us <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">highlighting this subject</a> and including a video demonstrating how easy it is to steal classic cars is to help readers make informed decisions about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-muscle-car-theft-deterrent/">how to secure their ride</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>It's not just classic cars which can be easy to steal, as you'll see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/hellcat-stolen-with-ease/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>To think criminals don’t already know how easy it is to swipe older vehicles would be naïve. While we’ve covered many stories of classic cars being boosted, there are many more we don’t highlight. With vehicle theft on the rise since 2020, you should be taking extra steps to secure any desirable rides you own, whether it’s a classic or something modern.</p>
<p>As you’ll see in the video, YouTube channel Uncle Tony’s Garage shows just how easy it was to steal a car back in the day. The guy hotwires a classic Dodge Dart using simple items, doing absolutely no damage to it. He gets it started in under a minute. Maybe you’re just shaking your head and laughing because you already knew how easy boosting one of these cars is, but for others this realization might be horrendously frightening.</p>
<p>People have tried locking the hood, something we see Jeep Wrangler owners do today, but those can be defeated. Others would take a vital piece of the car with them when parking the car for a long period in a lot, which might actually work. This guy even points out the flaw in how some kill switches are wired into car ignition systems, proving even those aren’t necessarily the magic bullet so many claim.</p>
<p>Really, what it comes down to is if someone wants your car they’ll find a way to get it. That’s not what anyone wants to hear, but it’s true. Your best bet is to make your ride such a hassle to take that a lazy thief will give up and try another target. While most aren’t that determined, you just never know who you’re dealing with.</p>
