<hr>
<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/teenager-scams-grocery-store/">Georgia woman</a> is accused of making up a fake business just to get government COVID-19 relief funds which she used to buy a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-dodge-charger-500s/">Dodge Charger</a>, among other things. It’s similar to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/covid-relief-money-used-cars/">other stories we’ve covered in the past</a>, demonstrating that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cash-for-clunkers-doom/">when the government is handing out money</a>, there are those who will do just about anything to get as much as possible.</p>

<p>According to federal prosecutors, Tracy Kirkland invented Kirklands Hair N Beauty, a salon she supposedly owned, employing 3 people. Using that information, she applied for a loan through the federal program set up to help business which have been struggling thanks to the government-imposed shutdowns.</p>
<p>Since her fraud wasn’t initially caught, Kirkland received a $66,400 deposit in her bank account in August 2020. With that money burning a hole in her pocket, the woman bought a 2019 Dodge Charger, although the exact model wasn’t listed.</p>
<p>Kirkland purchased other items and made large cash withdrawals from her account. None of those expenses were related in any way to running a salon. That just created a nice paper trail for prosecutors once her fraud was uncovered.</p>
<p>Rather than face an expensive, draining legal battle, Kirkland plead guilty to wire fraud in court. Not surprisingly, this isn’t Kirkland’s first trip around the block. Prosecutors say she’s a convicted felon. Through a plea deal, the Georgia woman is forfeiting her <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-kills-innocent-driver/">Dodge Charger</a> to the government, the one we all paid for with tax dollars. She also has to return $16,250 in cash and repay the $66,400 she obtained fraudulently. Usually, the fraud charges would come with a maximum 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, so she got off easy. Hopefully Kirkland has learned this time around crime ultimately doesn’t pay.</p>
