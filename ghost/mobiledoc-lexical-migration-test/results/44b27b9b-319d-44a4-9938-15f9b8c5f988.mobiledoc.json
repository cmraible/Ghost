          " was heading to Mecum’s Indy 2021 Auction. As possibly one of the rarest of the old Mopars, this car was expected to sell for record $6.5-million and it carried a reserve of $5.75-million. Unfortunately though, neither of those figures were reached during the auction and bidding topped out at $4.8-million. While it is immediately not clear as to why this car was a no-sale, it is clear that it was not about the car itself because this is probably the nicest example of one of the rarest muscle cars ever made. Additionally, its options list and history effectively make it a one-of-one car. "

One of those cars wore a Winchester Gray finish and was exported to France. In 1993, the car showed up in a for sale ad and was repatriated to the U.S. As of now the 1971 Plymouth ‘Cuda Convertible currently shows the equivalent of just over 61k-miles on the clock and is in as original of condition as any classic Mopar as we have ever seen.
