Its new mid-engine design features a 6.2-liter LT2 V8 pushing out a monstrous 495-horsepower, but that's not the craziest part! That 6.2L V8 is centered in between the axles for maximum stability and weight distribution making this car a handling machine. If that still wasn't enough for you it’s also mated to an 8-speed Tremec M1L dual-clutch to ensure perfect shift times and a beautiful driving experience."
