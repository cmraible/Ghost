          "The pressure is on for Stellantis as once again it finds itself on the wrong side of a hot industry trend, this time all-electric full-size pickup trucks. Out of major manufacturers, Ford jumped out first, revealing the F-150 Lightning, followed by Chevrolet showing off the Silverado EV this week. Now people are asking when Ram is going to ride the lightning and join the all-electric fad."

Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told Morgan Stanley analysts during a “virtual fireside chat” on January 5 that the Ram 1500 EV will indeed be coming in 2024, emphasizing that being third in the race doesn’t necessarily make one a loser. After all, we know it’s second place that’s the first loser."

But a good chunk are likely stepping back and waiting to see what problems arise for those who snatch up the first F-150 Lightnings. The fact Ram is hanging back could give Stellantis an advantage, allowing it to learn from the mistakes of its rivals, potentially releasing a superior product in 2024."

As is the case in all of life, the decision it’s making comes with some big risks. Considering Ram has been cleaning up lately, it probably feels secure in taking things a little slow, but only time will tell if it’s a wise or foolish move."
