Thanks to that, news of police leveling 11 “offences” (what we would call “charges”) for using a so-called clown car in TikTok videos just really isn’t shocking."

Queensland Police actually got an executed a search warrant of the guy’s house back in September, seizing the chopped-up car and one other vehicle. What would these police do if they witnessed a street race or takeover event? We truly wonder about that."
