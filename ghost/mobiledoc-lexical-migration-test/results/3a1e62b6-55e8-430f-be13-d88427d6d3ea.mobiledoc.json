This means many cars, like the Ford Mustang, Chevy Camaro, and Dodge Challenger, will see constrained supply. Another example is Daimler shutting down its compact car plant in Germany where 18,500 workers are employed. Instead of pumping out more Mercedes-Benz C-Class vehicles, the company is looking to put what semiconductor chips it has into more expensive model lines so profits don’t take as big of a hit."
