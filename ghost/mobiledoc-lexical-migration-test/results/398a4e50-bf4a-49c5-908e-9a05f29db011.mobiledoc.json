It was designed by the owner to accommodate low-riding supercars like Ferraris, no small feat considering it was constructed on cliffs with an extra-long driveway."

He also has a nice collection of vintage motorcycles in one of the garages. But the most vexing part of creating this modern 6,100 square foot home was designing a driveway slope which wouldn’t hurt Hammond’s precious Ferraris."

Using that rolling chassis, he was able to quickly determine what adjustments needed to be made until the driveway slope was perfect."
