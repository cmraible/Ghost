However, when we ran across this 1990 Toyota MR2 packing two Kawasaki Ninja ZX 10R engines, we weren’t quite sure what to think. That’s why we’re putting this Frankenstein project car in front of you to see what you think, because it’s listed on Facebook Marketplace, so it’s available for purchase now (if it doesn’t sell before this publishes)."

That’s where it becomes apparent even without any description of this build that it’s a car-motorcycle hybrid. The cosmetics sure could be ironed out in the rear, but more importantly we wonder how this Toyota corners at this point? It might be amazing, but we’d definitely take this thing for a test spin before plunking down any cash."
