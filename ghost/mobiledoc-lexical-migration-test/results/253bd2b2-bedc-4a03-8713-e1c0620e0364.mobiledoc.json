          " was no doubt created in the time of the third generation Porsche 911. While the exterior styling may not have changed much from the original first-gen, the car significantly improved performance and handling. The 1990s were a great time for cars worldwide as many of the incredible high-performance machines were starting to recover from a rough patch in the 1980s. Finally, those machines had gotten their pride back, and Porsche took the opportunity to make something, unlike anything the international automotive world had ever seen. "

          " is a pristine model with more than enough performance attributes for any classic European car enthusiast with a taste for speed. Sitting behind the rear axle of this potent Porsche sports car is a 3.3-liter flat-six engine. That incredible engine utilizes a massive turbocharger to produce 315 horsepower and 332 ft/lbs of torque which is an astonishing figure for a car that weighs 3,274lbs. The driving experience of this insane vehicle can only be described in one word, raw. Without a doubt, this was a totally intentional feature as the Porsche design team has been specializing in tight handling and high power for decades."

          " is transferred through a five-speed manual transaxle which further extends the incredible ferocity of this vehicle. Despite the incredibly violent acceleration and viscous cornering ability, the gearbox can still deliver a smoother ride for low-performance situations such as daily driving. However, if you intend to use this car for what it was made to do, track racing, then the limited-slip differential will suit you quite nicely as you drift through turns and straits like butter on a hot pan. This car is the perfect combination of style, performance, and drivability, making it something you should definitely consider buying soon!"
