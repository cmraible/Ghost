<hr>
<p>Just because production of the <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-8/">fastest factory Corvette </a>ever ended in 2019 doesn’t mean you can’t park one in your garage. Bring a Trailer has put up for bids this prime example <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-8/">2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1</a>. With only 92 miles on the clock this Corvette finished in Racing Yellow Tintcoat has barely ever been driven. It was originally delivered to its first owner through Alaska Sales and Service in Anchorage but it is currently being sold in California though the selling dealer. Only adding to its value, the original window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Alaska title accompanies the car.</p>

<p>You’ve likely heard what makes the <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-8/">2019 ZR-1</a> so potent on the track but just in case, it is the supercharged 6.2-liter LT5 V8 paired with a seven-speed manual transaxle under the hood. This car also features a factory limited-slip differential, color matched calipers, carbon-ceramic brakes, Magnetic Ride Control, and chrome staggered-diameter wheels. A carbon fiber front splitter, rocker panel extensions, removable Targa panel, and two-way-adjustable rear wing offer the exterior the perfect amount of contrast, though, in the ad it is pictured with a glass roof panel.</p>

<p>Inside is even more so a work of art as this car was ordered with the $10,000 3ZR Premium Equipment Group option. Options like the featured carbon-fiber trim, memory package, a premium audio system with Bluetooth and navigation, and heated and ventilated Jet Black leather seats with Custom yellow stitching. Of course, if GM had left out the OnStar and 4G LTE Wi-Fi services it would have been a crime. Originally, the going price for being able to control 755 horsepower and 715 lb-ft of torque from such a luxurious cockpit was $138,075 according to the original window sticker, but as of lately the value of <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-8/">last generations ZR-1</a> has gone up. <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-8/">Currently the bidding</a> is up to $127,000 with four days left on the auction. It’ll be interesting to see if this one breaks the $200,000 mark, we’re betting it will.</p>
