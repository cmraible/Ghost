As evident by the damage on the recovered vehicles, the Explorer was apparently used to ram through a locked gate causing significant damage including the roof carrier and the factory roof rails were torn from the vehicle. Both SUVs are extremely unique in terms of body modifications and paint jobs, and they were going to be auctioned off by Leake Auto Auction."

It first crossed the auction block in November 2018 in Dallas where it raised over $150,000 both through bids and various charitable donations, and then back in June of this year, it was auctioned off again in Tulsa raising another $75,000. There's no doubt the custom Explorer and Wrangler would have raised similar money as the Hurst Jeepster Commando tribute."
