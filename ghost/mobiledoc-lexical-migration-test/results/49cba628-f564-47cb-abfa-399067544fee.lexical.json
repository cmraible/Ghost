Thickly-padded leather bucket seats with red trim would definitely keep the driver and navigator from feeling stiff, even after hours of wheeling. The steering wheel hub was even padded and had leather upholstery – how about that? In true rally-car style, the shifter was located at the bottom of the center stack, making the driver’s right-hand movements shorter and thus quicker.",
