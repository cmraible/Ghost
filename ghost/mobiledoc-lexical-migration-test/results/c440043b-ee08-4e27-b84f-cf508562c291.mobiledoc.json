A 6-speed dual-clutch transmission makes for snappy gear changes. All-wheel drive makes this car a prime threat off the line. Before you make fun of the chrome pink wrap and princess graphics, know the owner/driver is a woman. And while she weighs less, her car tips the scales at a porky 3,800 lbs. so it’s a good thing it makes so much power."

It’s pushing 800-hp with a 540ci Big Block V8 with a 2-speed Powerglide directing that power to the rear axle. When it comes to curb weight, this thing has a huge advantage since it only comes in at 3,000 lbs. thanks in part to half the body panels being swapped for fiberglass. Plus, it has huge radials in the rear to help it hook up and make the competition shut up. Will that be enough to make up for the big gap in power?"
