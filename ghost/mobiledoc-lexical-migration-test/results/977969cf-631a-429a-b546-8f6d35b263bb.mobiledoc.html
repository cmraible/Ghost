<h3 id="this-is-the-actual-indy-car-pace-truck-used-from-1991-until-1994">This is the actual Indy Car pace truck used from 1991 until 1994.</h3>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.autoclassics.com/tag/pace-car/" rel="nofollow">pace cars</a> throughout history have always been production cars that have been modified with added lights, stickers and safety devices for track duty, but that wasn't the case in the '80s and early '90s with the PPG Indy Car World Series. Sponsored by PPG, Indy Car had a wide variety of custom pace and support vehicles during this time including this customized 1991 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/F-150" rel="nofollow">Ford F-150</a>, which is currently up for sale by Streetside Classics of Nashville.</p>

<p>This one-off pace truck was created in 1991 at a cost of $250,000, and it was used as the pace truck from 1991 until 1994. The custom body and interior were created by McLaren Performance Technologies (the company responsible for building the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Buick/GNX" rel="nofollow">Buick GNX</a>, not the British supercar maker, McLaren), while the truck's performance upgrades were performed by Roush.</p>
<p>Most of the styling changes were achieved by adding extra cladding to the body, but the most unique elements of this truck are the single-piece body and bed as well as the rear-facing seats for track workers. Cutouts in the side of the bed provide access to these seats, while the central arch acts as an integral roll bar. This truck was originally painted white, purple and red until 1993 when it received its current purple, green and yellow paint scheme.</p>

<p>To make sure the pace truck wasn't too slow to pace the 200+ mph Indy Car racers, Roush added a 500-horsepower, 5.0-liter V8 with aftermarket heads and intake. Additional peformance and safety modifications include water-cooled brakes, full roll cage, fire suppression system and a fuel cell. Since its duties were limited to the track, this truck's miles were limited, and today, the odometer shows just 5,145 actual miles.</p>
