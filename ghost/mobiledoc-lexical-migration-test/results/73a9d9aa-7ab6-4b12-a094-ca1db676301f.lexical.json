No longer is the Pokédex an automated, electronic device that immediately records all relevant information of a newly caught Pokémon; you and the Survey Corps that you work with are actively creating the Pokédex in Hisui (the land that will one day become known as the Sinnoh region). Catching one Pokémon isn’t enough; you are tasked with observing Pokémon behaviour through Research Tasks. These can range from catching many of the same species, defeating them in battle, defeating them with certain types of moves, giving them food, catching them at certain times or in certain ways and so much more. You can also use them in battle yourself to learn more about them through the use of certain specific attacks. With this shift in focus, battling has become a lot more optional. With the use of stealth, no longer do you always need to battle a Pokémon in order to catch it. One can simply sneak through the grass and throw a Poké Ball at it from behind. Sneaking up from behind will produce a greater chance of catching Pokémon as well. Unless the Pokémon is aggressive and sees you first, or they are particularly strong, sneaking is always an option now. This feels like a natural progression for the series as for a long time, it has always claimed to have been all about exactly that since its first outing.",

Agile Style is the opposite, sacrificing power for the chance to take two turns in a row. This allows the player to decide the tide of the battle in new ways.

The Galaxy Team represents the British Empire as evidenced by their more Western Architecture, as well as some of their members having more Western names like ‘Cyllene’ and ‘Beauregard’; The Diamond and Pearl Clans seem to be emblematic of rival samurai clans, evidenced by their traditional values like refusing to use Poké Balls. This level of attention to the setting, coupled with the entirely unique Pokémon evolutions and regional forms, makes the game feel like more than just another spinoff. ",

            "text": "is a splendid improvement to the classic formula, there are still a few missteps that I feel are worth mentioning. For starters, there are some flaws with the overhauled battle system. Now, Pokémon don’t always take alternating turns; sometimes, Pokémon can take two or even three turns in a row. While this can be great for the player to blitz a slow but sturdy Pokémon down, this is a power that enemies are also able to abuse. With this change, you no longer select your move at the same time as your opponent and wait for both to play out. Now, you select your move immediately before it’s used, like most turn-based RPGs. These two factors can culminate in the player getting into a battle, sending out a Pokémon that is weak to its opponent and watching as it takes two moves in a row to defeat yours before you even have the chance to strategise. It isn’t a fundamentally bad mechanic but it just feels less than perfectly executed. ",

Speed-adjusting moves have also been completely removed in favour of the speed mechanic changes I’ve mentioned earlier, so moves like Quick Attack now simply adjust the future turn order. With all of this being considered, moves like Calm Mind and Bulk Up that affect both Offensive and Defensive stats are literally the best buffing moves in the game because, keeping in mind that Speed is not adjusted in the traditional sense, the only stat these moves do not raise is your health. This seems like an oversimplification; not necessarily a deal-breaker because battling is not the primary focus of this game, but an oversimplification nonetheless.",

All of them, with the exception of Confusion, have been changed to, in essence, become either Poison or Paralysis. Burn and Freeze (now frostbite) both function identically to Poison. Sleep (now Drowsy) functions identically to Paralysis. This takes a lot of strategy out of the game as you can no longer guarantee yourself time to set up as you cannot be sure that your opponent will not attack through use of Sleep or Freeze. This also provides an immense buff to the move Rest as Paralysis is a much lower price to pay for a complete restoration of your HP.
