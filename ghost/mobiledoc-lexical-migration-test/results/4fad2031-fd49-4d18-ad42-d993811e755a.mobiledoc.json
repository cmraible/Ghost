It’s been polished nicely, while bright chrome on the bumpers, wheel covers, and lower portion of the rear fenders is a striking contrast. Like other cars from its time, this Cord 810 wears a split windscreen and smashing wide whitewall tires, but other design elements are well ahead of their time. Take, for example, the headlights which fold into the front fenders. The door hinges were concealed, like on modern vehicles. These innovations create a sleekness not seen with other cars in the 1930s and for some time thereafter."

Launching his own brand using his surname, Cord ran into financial trouble early in the Great Depression. He returned to market with the Cord 810, which wowed the public and was immediately called “coffin-nose” as a term of endearment for the advanced vehicle."
