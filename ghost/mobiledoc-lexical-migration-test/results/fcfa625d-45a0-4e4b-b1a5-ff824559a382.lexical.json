            "text": "The Ford GT40 is one of those cars whose reputation for high speed has left a legacy that overshadows nearly every other supercar from the 1960s. While it's true that Ford brought back the car we all know and love in the early 2000s and then once again in 2017, there really is nothing like the original car today. That means that, like many cars of its time, these things are usually left alone in the aftermarket community as there aren't many of them to go around. That is until one crazy builder was willing to push the limits of his own skill by building an insane GT40 of his own which he has named \"Ruffian.\"",

            "text": "It's pretty easy to see exactly why this car holds that name. Under the rear roof panel of the vehicle sits a gigantic 5.2-liter Aluminator V8 engine that resembles the Coyote platform in many ways except for one key component. This utilizes a cross-plane crankshaft to produce a whopping 580 horsepower, officially making it the highest power naturally aspirated V8 crate engine ever made by Ford. That is a significant number on its own but begins to seem absolutely insane when you consider that the original car only weighed about 1,800-2,300 lbs. One glance at this car will tell you that it may, in fact, be even lighter as a bunch of exterior modifications were made with carbon fiber to shed more weight.",

Hence, he modified his exhaust to use an upgraded headers setup and a quad-tip exhaust to give it a new sound and add to the looks of the great car. Another thing that contributes to the sound of this car is the tall gearing that this monstrous V8 has been made to work with. Interestingly enough, this GT40 also uses a reverse speedometer, right-hand drive, and a right-hand shift knob which seems confusing to ordinary enthusiasts but was precisely what this driver wanted. The dedication to this build is absolutely stunning, and we look forward to seeing its sister car, a first-gen Mustang, in the future.",
