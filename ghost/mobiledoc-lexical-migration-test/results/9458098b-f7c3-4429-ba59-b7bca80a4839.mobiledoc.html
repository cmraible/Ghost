<p>“The goal is community protection — herd immunity — since vanquishing the virus means not leaving sanctuaries of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 in pockets across our cities and towns across America. This is a political project, because if there is any lesson of pandemics past — and the long history of American health crises — it’s that we are happy to live with health disparities in the United States as long as they are someone else’s misery.” -- Epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves, writing <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/covid-vaccination-pandemic-end/">in </a><em><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/covid-vaccination-pandemic-end/">The Nation</a></em> today.</p>

<p>Corporate subsidies, in the form of economic development tax abatements, cost public school districts $2.4 billion in revenue in the 2019 fiscal year, according to a <a href="https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/abatingourfuture">new report </a>from Good Jobs First, a corporate and government accountability organization. According to the report, “97 school districts lost more than $5 million each, and 149 districts lost more than $1,000 per student. That left less money for students, who suffered poorer schools, and caused working families to pay higher local and state taxes.”</p>
<p>Good Jobs First and the American Economic Liberties Project <a href="https://twitter.com/econliberties/status/1379803652584570883?s=20">are calling on</a> the Treasury Department to ensure that the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/this-last-minute-provision-blocks-gop-govs-using-stimulus-money-subsidize-tax-cuts-1576676">American Rescue Plan’s ban</a> on using state and local aid to fund tax cuts applies to these corporate handouts.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-scoop-"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>Nearly one in five American households had medical debt in 2017, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/who-had-medical-debt-in-united-states.html">new data</a> from the U.S. Census Bureau, meaning that they were unable to pay for medical costs at the time of receiving care. That number went up for households with children under the age of 18, as well as for Black and Hispanic households.</p>
<p>The new data comes as the Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57125">reports</a> that a public health insurance option, depending on how it’s designed, could help matters by offering lower premiums than private options and reducing the costs of administering health insurance, not to mention increasing federal revenue.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden campaigned on establishing a public option, but has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/biden-considers-health-care-public-option-in-economic-recovery-plan.html">not yet</a> proposed the policy, or announced whether he will do so. Instead, he has so far opted to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-biden-lifts-health-care-plan/">increase subsidies</a> to put more people on expensive private health insurance plans, where roughly <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-gift-health-insurance/">one-in-six claims</a> for in-network medical care are denied.</p>

<p><strong>• SEC SIDES WITH AMAZON ON WORKER SAFETY: </strong>Biden’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/shareholder-proposal-no-action-responses.htm">concurred with</a> Amazon’s request to withhold a worker safety proposal, put forward by New York City’s pension funds, from a shareholder vote. The proposal would have required Amazon to conduct an internal review of how adequately it handled the COVID-19 pandemic in regards to worker health and safety, <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-tries-to-block-vote-on-worker/">previously reported</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• JPMORGAN CEO SAYS SALT CAP REPEAL IS HANDOUT TO RICH:</strong> In a surprising moment of clarity, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called out five states — California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York — for advocating for a repeal of the $10,000 cap on state and local (SALT) tax deductions. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/jamie-dimon-slams-state-and-local-tax-repeal-as-a-benefit-to-the-rich-.html">In a letter</a> to shareholders, Dimon criticized the states for fighting “for unlimited state and local tax deductions… even though they are aware that over 80% of those deductions will accrue to people earning more than $339,000 a year.” Federal Democratic lawmakers <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporate-dems-show-progressives/">have also</a> been calling for a repeal of the SALT cap, demanding Biden include it in the infrastructure package, but Biden has <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1378068461763497984?s=20">so far</a> refused.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN GOES SOFT ON CORPORATE TAX EVADERS: </strong>As part of his infrastructure bill, Biden has proposed a series of new corporate taxes to raise revenue. One of those taxes is a new 15 percent minimum tax on large corporations –– many of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/economy/zero-corporate-tax.html">have paid</a> an effective tax rate of zero percent since President Donald Trump passed his own tax bill in 2017. But Biden’s proposal would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-softens-tax-proposal-aimed-at-profitable-companies-that-pay-little-11617809422">only apply to</a> 45 companies, far fewer than the number in the original version of the proposal that he campaigned on.</p>
