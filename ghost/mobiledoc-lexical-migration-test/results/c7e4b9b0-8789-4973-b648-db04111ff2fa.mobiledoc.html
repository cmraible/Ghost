<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering, </strong></p>
<p>Do individual choices to reduce consumption (i.e. eating a plant-based diet, switching to an electric vehicle, or taking fewer flights) have any ethical or moral value? I hear a lot that individual choices will not be enough, by far, to combat the climate crisis. Are these sorts of lifestyle changes just an empty form of virtue signaling and diversion of our attention from more meaningful targets ‚Äî or could they be valuable in other ways that are more indirect?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Just Wondering</p>
<p><strong>Dear Just Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>As you‚Äôve picked up on, this question is one of the driving forces behind this column. For the sake of not spoiling the whole game, I‚Äôll focus on one query that‚Äôs come in from a few readers, on the ethics of switching to a plant-based diet. That‚Äôs also, in part, because the topic occupies a category of its own.</p>
<p>After fossil fuels, animal agriculture is the <a href="https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/#:~:text=Animal%20agriculture%20is%20the%20second,air%20pollution%20and%20biodiversity%20loss.">largest</a> of humanity‚Äôs contributions to global warming. It produces not only tremendous amounts of methane (‚Äúcow farts‚Äù or ‚Äî <a href="https://www.space.com/cow-burps-methane-emissions-climate-change">more significantly</a> ‚Äî burps) but is also a leading driver of deforestation, which saps biodiversity, the livelihoods of indigenous peoples who call the earth‚Äôs forests home, as well as the planet‚Äôs capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The industry brings other horrors, too. Slaughterhouses and other businesses that are part of commodity meat production are almost cartoonishly evil employers that have left farmers in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/us/politics/black-farmers-debt-relief.html">eye-watering debt</a> as the industry has figured out new and more efficient means of bringing meat to market. As it happens, a business model built on the systematic confinement and slaughter of billions of creatures doesn‚Äôt treat the people charged with carrying that out too well, either.</p>
<p>Food operates a bit differently than other drivers of global warming vis-a-vis personal choice, too. Take electricity: The primary thing people want from it is to be able to reliably turn on the lights. You don‚Äôt make a choice each time you plug in your laptop about where the power behind your Netflix binge comes from. But you do decide what to eat for lunch every day or pick up at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Such food choices are shaped by policy, almost to an absurd degree. Meat and dairy corporations in the U.S. receive on average <a href="https://scet.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/CopyofFINALSavingThePlanetSustainableMeatAlternatives.pdf">$38 billion</a> in subsidies each year, making animal products artificially cheap.</p>
<p>Beyond those market signals are a whole complicated set of questions about whether switching to a plant-based diet makes sense to you, personally. Do you happen to live near stores that offer fresh produce and an abundance of plant-based protein options? Do you know how to cook them, or (like many in the U.S.) did you grow up learning that meat and dairy were an essential part of a balanced diet, thanks to post-war industrial policy? Do you have the time to experiment with new recipes?</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, vegan diets are as much as <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/vegan-diets-oxford-university/">30 percent cheaper</a> on average than today‚Äôs typical diets worldwide ‚Äî and potentially even more so now that meat prices are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meat-prices-pandemic-inflation-corporate-greed/">on the rise</a>. Still, there‚Äôs plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tviyAIS9c_U">advertising</a> in place to help make meat demand <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012915/what-difference-between-inelasticity-and-elasticity-demand.asp">inelastic</a>. Though economists have cast growing meat consumption worldwide as simply a function of rising incomes, it‚Äôs also a product of the U.S. exporting a particular development model premised on growing markets for the planet‚Äôs most polluting industries.</p>
<p>All that‚Äôs to say, if at some point you‚Äôve experimented with going vegan or vegetarian and fallen off the wagon ‚Äî don‚Äôt beat yourself up. There are factors at work beyond self-discipline.</p>

<p>So what role should individual choices about whether to eat meat play when all the cards seem to be stacked against you? Even <a href="https://lux-magazine.com/article/our-animals-ourselves/">on the left</a>, making claims on what people eat is still seen as the province of fringe hippie lifestylists or (worse) vegan killjoys.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://lux-magazine.com/article/our-animals-ourselves/">essay</a> for <em>Lux</em>, Astra and Sanaura Taylor describe veganism as ‚Äúan aspirational category, an acknowledgement of values that cannot be fully manifested in the world as it currently exists. Refusing to consume animal products is not an act of negation, but a proactive commitment to working to usher in a more emancipatory, egalitarian, and ecologically sustainable society.‚Äù</p>
<p>That idea of veganism as aspirational praxis slots in alongside the push for structural changes to proliferate plant-based diets, from the ‚ÄúGreen New Deal for legumes‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/jan_dutkiewicz/status/1419641073715056647">suggested</a> by political economist Jan Dutkiewicz ‚Äî a federal effort to transform the public‚Äôs relationship to protein and its associated production chain ‚Äî to public research funding for alternatives like <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163554/lab-meat-save-planet">cultivated meat</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with fixating on lifestyle choices as the end-all-be-all of making the world a better place is ignoring the context in which people make those changes, emphasizing personal over societal transformation. But those needn‚Äôt be mutually exclusive. Nestled within a broader theory of change, going plant-based isn‚Äôt either empty virtue signaling or a counterproductive diversion from more meaningful goals.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Left Wondering,</strong></p>
<p>I am planning a trip from Europe to the U.S. in the coming months. In the past, when I've visited family in the U.S., I've always gone by plane. This time, I have the time and flexibility to consider other modes of travel ‚Äî namely, by sea. But what is the most environmentally friendly way to travel? I was leaning towards taking a freighter or a repositioning cruise, but have since been told that those are no better (or possibly even worse!) than flying. How do they really stack up?</p>
<p>And ‚Äî this is perhaps the harder question ‚Äî is traveling for pleasure, especially longer distances, defensible at all? As an expat, never traveling internationally isn't an option, and I try to limit flights to once a year. But I've also often wondered about the fallacy of putting too much weight on individual choices rather than on political and social change. On the other hand, the carbon footprint even for a single transatlantic flight is simply enormous. How to think about this?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wondering at Sea</p>
<p><strong>Dear Wondering at Sea,</strong></p><!--members-only-->
<p>Just in time for the summer travel season!</p>
<p>Airlines are a small but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/climate/air-travel-emissions.html">growing</a> chunk of emissions, accounting for about 3 to 4 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and 2.5 percent worldwide. That share could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/climate/air-travel-emissions.html">triple</a> by 2050. Clean alternatives for flight (like hydrogen fuel cells) could be a ways off, and, in the meantime, there aren‚Äôt great alternatives for getting across oceans.</p>
<p>Mile for mile, cruise ships offer a bigger carbon footprint than air travel, along with a variety of undesirable effects on oceans and the cities that host them. You might also be keen to avoid catching a norovirus.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>Traveling by freighter theoretically allows you to hitch a ride on ships that are moving anyway, though isn‚Äôt exactly scalable: It can be prohibitively expensive ‚Äî around <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-ultimate-carbon-saving-tip-travel-by-cargo-ship/">$100 a day</a> for room and board on multi-week journeys ‚Äî and involve sorting through a mountain of complicated paperwork that will give you an intimate look at the world‚Äôs current supply chain chaos.</p>
<p>For now, in other words, you‚Äôre probably better off flying.</p>
<p>Your second question is indeed the harder one. As you say, traveling internationally is essentially required for people with loved ones on different continents. But what about people who‚Äôd like to see the world?</p>
<p>They‚Äôre less of a driving force in airline emissions than you might think. Though business travelers make up 12 percent of passengers on commercial airlines, they account for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp">75 percent</a> of profits thanks to the more extravagant fares they‚Äôre willing to put on company cards. That outsized share also means that companies have emphasized business and first class fares, the latter of which can carry a carbon footprint nearly <a href="https://qz.com/94268/first-class-airline-passengers-are-to-blame-for-global-warming/">seven times</a> higher than the average economy class trip.</p>
<p>Where there are good alternatives ‚Äî like a train or bus ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth taking them. That may be easier for you in Europe than in the U.S., where even short trips on Amtrak are relatively sparse and expensive. Having taken both, riding a public high speed train is a hell of a lot more pleasant than a Spirit Airlines or Ryanair flight.</p>
<p>Still, such choices aren‚Äôt exactly a panacea. Outbound European flights traveling less than 250 miles ‚Äî about a third of all EU departures ‚Äî accounted for just 4.3 percent of the bloc‚Äôs aviation emissions. Those over 2,500 miles (about 6 percent of all flights) made up 50 percent of emissions from flying, according to <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/eurocontrol-data-snapshot-co2-emissions-flight-distance">Eurocontrol</a>. The worst offenders on this front aren‚Äôt people going home once a year to see relatives or even taking an annual vacation abroad, but business people making routine private and first class Transatlantic trips between New York, London, Frankfurt, and Beijing.</p>
<p>The airlines themselves are to blame as well, of course. Like shipping companies, airlines aren‚Äôt subject to the Paris Agreement. The International Civil Aviation Organization ‚Äî a UN agency ‚Äî is officially tasked with figuring out a plan for reducing the industry‚Äôs emissions, though it has so far fallen short. The carbon offsetting scheme it developed to cut carbon has been widely criticized, and there‚Äôs little oversight over outlandish claims from companies that their flights are ‚Äú<a href="https://dohanews.co/qatar-airways-defends-160-additional-daily-flights-at-carbon-neutral-world-cup/">carbon neutral</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not to say the relatively small portion of those who can and do fly shouldn‚Äôt be mindful when they do, trying to limit journeys as much as possible and opt for trips closer to home when planning a vacation. Purchasing carbon offsets yourself can be a bit of a wild west in terms of figuring out who and what to trust (there are <em>lots</em> of <a href="https://climeworks.com/subscriptions">scams</a> out there!), and even the most reputable of them are only worth so much so long as airlines continue to balloon and grounded alternatives remain scarce.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
