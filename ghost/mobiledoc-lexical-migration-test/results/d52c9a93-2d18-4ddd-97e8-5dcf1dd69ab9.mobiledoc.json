The back wheels are sent spinning with the help of a Ford 9” rear end and the Speedtech suspension combines perfectly with the Wilwood brakes to make a great handling car. Deep dish rear wheels give the car a very “muscle car” presence and the 325 tires have just enough meat on them to give the car good grip."

A Black Widow Venom 250 exhaust system accompanies the enormous engine with 3” stainless steel pipes which perfectly accent the unique sound of a cammed GM small block. The interior is described by the owner as “deluxe”. The seats and steering wheel, however, give off the feel of a true race car. As this wicked ride rips through the streets of LA all that can be seen in its wake is smoke. "
