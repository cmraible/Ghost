          " have been helpful in thousands of off-road situations ranging from rock climbs to mudding. Toyota made these cheap, reliable, and well-built creations of practical innovation to cross the rough terrain of rural Japan, making them the perfect car for anyone with a passion for exploration. Virtually every movie with some off-road transportation needs has had a Toyota or Nissan. There's a big reason for that: the little cars can be quite capable of traversing some insane terrain after only minimal modification. With this particular car, you'll be able to go anywhere you set your mind to as it sports plenty of performance numbers, body modifications, and ground clearance to keep your car running in the dirtiest of conditions."

          " may seem pretty unsuspecting, but that is precisely what makes it such a great purchase. From the factory, the truck came with more than enough clearance to go off-roading, and you'll note that Toyota has a beautiful reputation for building engines that last. This is no ordinary grocery getter. Instead, it is the type of automobile that perfectly embodies the idea of an SUV. Under the hood is a 4.7-liter V8 engine which sends all of its power to a four-wheel-drive system, yet another reason to use this thing off-road. "

          ", you'll notice two significant pieces that stick out like a golden egg to any truck enthusiast as essential for mudding and rough terrain. Front and center is a pretty massive grille guard that seems to withstand nearly anything you throw at with its robust build quality and highly rigid materials pushing through obstacles with ease. The second most obvious modification is the snorkel which allows the car to go through water and mud without sucking in any hazardous debris. This Land Cruiser is possibly the best platform for any offroader or a utilitarian enthusiast looking for a reliable racer and explorer."
