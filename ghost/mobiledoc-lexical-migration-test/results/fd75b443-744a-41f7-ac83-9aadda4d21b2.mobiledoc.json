That starts with its gorgeous coat of Matador Red paint, which is complemented by the white RS body striping and a black convertible soft top. Being the RS, this Camaro has an unmistakable look with its hidden headlights, while the SS side of the equation packs a 396 CID V8 under the hood. As if this Camaro wasn't desirable enough, the 350-horsepower engine is matched with a four-speed manual gearbox."

The 396 V8 should sound even better thanks to a Magnaflow exhaust system, and speaking of sound, this car has a modern audio system with Bluetooth capability and ports for both USB and AUX."
