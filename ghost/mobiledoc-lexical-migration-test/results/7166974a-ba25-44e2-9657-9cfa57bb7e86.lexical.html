<p>One of the great things about building a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/younger-gearheads-restomod/">restomod</a> like this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-chevrolet-chevelle/">1970 Chevrolet Chevelle</a> is that you, as the owner, can enjoy the lines of a classic and the benefits of modern performance. While using <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/news-porsche-911-turbo-s-is-an-instant-collectible/">forced induction</a> certainly is controversial with some gearheads, we expect the 22-inch wheels installed on this muscle car will cause much more of a stir.</p>

<p>Right up front, the star of the show is the LS3 V8 with twin Nelson Racing 72 mm turbos. A long list of upgrades have been installed in the engine, including a Stage 2 cam, built bottom end, etc. All that is channeled through a 9-inch rear. Horsepower is unknown since the owner hasn’t thrown this build on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/speedkore-hellephant-dyno/">dyno</a> yet, but he estimates it’s making between 800 and 900. Watch the video and you’ll hear this thing at WOT, which sounds amazing.</p>

<p>With all that extra power, the suspension needed a complete overhaul with Bilstein shocks, beefier sway bars, etc. While 4-wheel disc brakes have been installed, this car shockingly is still using the original booster.</p>
<p>We also suspect not everyone is going to be a fan of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/restomods-on-motorious/">halo LED headlights</a> since those change up the look of the front fascia. However, they pair incredibly well with the white paint and black trim and stripes, plus the white grille insert.</p>

<p>This is yet another car that wasn’t in horrible shape, and some gearheads take exception with using anything other than a junked ride to create a restomod. However, the owner says once he and his crew started tearing into the thing they discovered it really wasn’t all that original since someone had installed parts from Pontiacs and other cars.</p>
<p>That’s a good thing to keep in mind when you’re looking at a listing for what’s claimed to be an “original” car, since you might not know what all has been done to it throughout the years. In this case, the body of the Chevelle was in good condition, but pretty much everything else had to be replaced.</p>
