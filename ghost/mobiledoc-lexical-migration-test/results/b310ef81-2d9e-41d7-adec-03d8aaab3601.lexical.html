<p>Looking highly presentable after a thorough restoration process, this Camaro proudly wears Bolero Red over black, a color combination many find irresistible, plus it matches what was applied originally in the factory. It also has a black viny roof and body graphics, plus mirror-like chrome accents for a presentation worthy of entering into a show.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, this Camaro RS/SS has a numbers-matching 396ci V8. That engine was rebuilt in 2008. Mated up to it is a four-speed manual Muncie transmission which was overhauled in 2018. To ensure this car is mechanically sound, the seller states one of the shocks, a brake caliper, and the brake fluid were all recently replaced. In other words, this sounds like a true turn-key investment you can begin enjoying from day one.</p>
