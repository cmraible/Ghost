Enthusiasts are understandably nervous about what might happen to muscle cars in the coming months and years since many people in high places have declared or heavily implied they want to see performance vehicles become a thing of the past. Helping to allay some fears, Dodge revealed a wide selection of new additions to its Direct Connection performance parts line."

It comes with 4130 chromoly tubing plus a fully TIG-welded roll cage and is NHRA-certified for 7.50-second elapsed times. A four-link rear suspension, double-adjustable Bilstein coilovers tuned specifically for the rolling chassis, Strange Engineering 9-inch rear, Weld beadlock lightweight wheels, Mickey Thompson drag racing tires, and Strange Pro Series II racing brakes are all included. At $89,999 this setup is nice but definitely not for those on a strict budget."
