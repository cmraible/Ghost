Any G-Class is sure to stand out wearing such meaty tires and legit bead-lock wheels, but this one will definitely get plenty of looks thanks to its Alien Green body wrap that mimics the color used on the G550 4x4². The hood, bumpers, roof, tire cover and fender flares remain in this SUV's original black paint adding even more style with a two-tone color scheme."

The seats are wrapped in black Nappa leather, and the dark interior is accented by burl walnut wood trim. Likewise, this beast's drivetrain was left alone since the 5.0-liter V8 delivers plenty of brute strength through a five-speed automatic transmission and a four-wheel drive system with three locking differentials."
