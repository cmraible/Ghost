You can get it either with a 6-speed manual or an automatic with paddle shifters. Magnetic Ride Control and a performance suspension specifically tuned for it are also included, making the muscle car quite the threat both on a straightaway and in turns. However, this thing isn’t exactly lightweight, tipping the scale at a stout 3,907 lbs."
