<p>On Thursday, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> published a pretty remarkable column arguing that people should spotlight the climate crisis in every discussion they have. The piece, which echoed the astronomers’ clarion calls to “follow the science” in Adam McKay and David Sirota’s climate allegory film <em>Don’t Look Up</em>, was a pleasant surprise, given the <em>LA Times</em>’ comfortable position as a massive legacy news brand. McKay and Sirota are quoted in the column, stressing the collective resolve needed to rapidly address the climate crisis, which is on a glide path to making the planet uninhabitable in the near future. “There’s a segment of the populace that understands the threat but doesn’t understand the urgency,” said Sirota. “If we can move those people, we can make this an electorally salient issue.”</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-04-07/climate-change-2022-adam-mckay-elizabeth-warren"><strong>The Only Thing We Should Be Talking About Is The Climate Crisis</strong></a> (Los Angeles Times) — <em>“Why are we talking about anything but climate change? This is a question I ask myself every time scientists release one of their consistently alarming reports on the projected countdown to doomsday. Doomsday being the moment when the ability to lower the atmospheric temperature has slipped from our control. The moment when we puny humans are finally and irrevocably at the mercy of hurricanes, fires, tornadoes, drought, food shortages, rising sea levels and all the socio-political carnage that will accompany same. The moment that, by the latest estimates, is less than 10 years away. So the first thing we need to do is stop using the term ‘climate change,’ which makes the situation seem relatively benign and natural, as if the Earth were entering menopause and all those scientists just want us to know that hot flashes can be expected. The man-made shift they are predicting will cause a large number of humans to regularly die by heat, fire, water, drought and famine. That isn’t a ‘change,’ that’s a crisis.”</em><br></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-to-unionize-at-amazon"><strong>How To Unionize At Amazon</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>“Their win was instantly remarkable: the first Amazon union outside of Europe. More remarkable still, the Amazon Labor Union was new and completely independent. It had none of the money or political connections of traditional organized labor... In hindsight, the A.L.U. embraced classic principles of labor organizing but, in critical respects, it did not. ‘Amazon is designed like nothing we’ve ever seen before,’ Bryson explained. ‘People think the way to attack them is head on, but, no, you have to come at them ‘awkward,’ with things they’d never expect.’”</em><br></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/07/its-happening-now-how-rising-sea-levels-are-causing-a-us-migration-crisis"><strong>‘It’s Happening Now’: How Rising Sea Levels Are Causing A U.S. Migration Crisis</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“Research published in 2020 in the journal PLOS One estimated that sea level rise could cause over 13 million Americans to relocate inland by 2100 — an outcome with huge economic, social and political consequences. Yet, even with the deluge of warnings, there is no centralized lifeline available to coastal communities. There are a number of federal programs designed to give assistance to such areas through government bodies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), but those pots of money are far from adequate to tackle a problem of this scale. Some local governments have chosen to offer — and in a few cases mandate — buyouts to homeowners in vulnerable areas, who wind up dispersing. Others would prefer to keep the neighborhood intact — in Taholah’s case, by moving the whole village.”</em><br></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/jay-z-beyonce-picket-line-party-celebrity-activism-oscars-chateau-marmont"><strong>Jay-Z And Beyoncé Crossing A Picket Line To Party Shows How Shallow Celebrity Activism Really Is</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“The contradiction of billionaire</em> ‘<em>activist’ celebrities crossing a picket line was almost entirely ignored in the post-Oscars discussion. Instead, it was the</em> ‘<em>celebrity slap</em>’<em> that generated currency: the incident in which millionaire Hollywood actor Will Smith smacked the Oscars host, millionaire Hollywood comedian Chris Rock, for making an inappropriate joke about Will’s wife, millionaire Hollywood actor Jada Pinkett Smith. In a glaring indictment of our current priorities, commentators obsess over the foibles of the megarich while workers struggle to live.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/style/ben-mckenzie-crypto.html"><strong>Ben McKenzie Would Like A Word With The Crypto Bros</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“Over the last six months, as A-list celebrities have shilled for digital currencies and NFTs, Mr. McKenzie, a TV actor best known for his starring role in ‘The O.C.,’ has become an outspoken skeptic. He’s written critically about the #ad for little-known coins that Kim Kardashian posted on Instagram and earnestly asked Reese Witherspoon to stop proselytizing about the metaverse, all while acknowledging that he’s not a financial expert. ‘I’m just a former teen idol standing here (alone?) asking people to consider downside risk and the possibility of fraud,’ he tweeted in February.”</em><br></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/opinion/baseball-nationalize.html"><strong>Baseball Is Dying. The Government Should Take It Over.</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“We need to stop pretending that baseball has a broad-based enthusiastic following and begin to see the game for what it is: the sports equivalent of collecting 78 r.p.m. records. Baseball is America’s game only in the sense that jazz is America’s music or that Henry James is America’s literature. It is time that we acknowledged this truth by affording baseball the same approbation we reserve for those other neglected cultural treasures.”</em><br></li>
    <li><em><a href="https://www.theringer.com/features/2022/3/30/22990907/great-dismal-swamp-resistance-history-feature"><strong>The Hidden And Eternal Spirit Of The Great Dismal Swamp</strong></a> (The Ringer) — <em>“From the late 17th century to the end of the Civil War, thousands of maroons — runaways who obtained their freedom by occupying remote and uninhabited regions — lived in relative secrecy throughout the 750-square-mile wilderness. No one is sure exactly how many people escaped enslavement within its confines, but this much is clear: The Great Dismal Swamp, an area regarded by colonial settlers as so utterly inhospitable that its very air was once said to be toxic, was over multiple centuries home to the largest maroon community in the United States.”</em></em></li>
    <li><em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-rise-of-consensual-non-monogamy/amp"><strong>Is Monogamy Over? Inside Love’s Sharing Economy</strong></a> (Vogue) —<em> “Throughout the course of their marriage, Megan and Marty buried the rebel-heartedness that initially bonded them. Marty remembers a traumatic early childhood and his late mother’s alcoholism, and grew up wild and hard-partying. Megan was driven by wanderlust, living in Belgium for a year at 17, then in Spain during a year of college, where she dated men during breaks in her on-and-off premarital relationship with Marty. ‘I felt so free. I was exploring. I was learning new languages, meeting people,</em>’<em> she recalls.</em> ‘<em>I felt like everything was possible.</em>’<em> In the years that followed, that unbridled part of her faded into a rarely seen alter ego that she and Marty referred to as</em> ‘<em>Barcelona Megan.</em>’ <em>Both children of divorce, Megan and Marty committed to monogamy, vowing — especially after their children were born — that their marriage would last forever. However ironically, it was that pledge that began cracking the long-closed door of their union.”</em></em></li>
