          "During the Chevelle's initial 1964 model year, 294,160 first-year Chevelles were built and sold, including 76,460 SS models. An instant hit, Chevelle sales increased each year, although the numbers includes the Malibu, El Camino, and Monte Carlo. The production number for the 1972 model year is 450,842 (without the Monte Carlo). Many different body styles and power plants were available to choose from, as well as cars that shared the Chevelle name. (The Oshawa, Ontario plant numbers are only available from 1969 through 1972.)"

          "The Chevelle was a reigning muscle car back in the late '60s and early '70s, and easily tops the dream car list of many enthusiasts everywhere. With a fastback sloping roofline on a muscular body, there's no denying the Chevelle's attractive aesthetic. To make it even better, pair that with a big, beefy V8. Back in the muscle car era, the Chevelle was a reigning king of the road, and it still a highly desired model today."
