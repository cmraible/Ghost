<hr>
<p>Chevrolet recently announced that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/copo-camaro-2022/">2022 Chevy COPO Camaro</a> was going to come with a massive 527 cubic inch engine, and we can dig it. The old adage of "no replacement for displacement" hasn’t aged perfectly with time, but the idea of a big engine stuffed into the engine bay of a mid-size muscle car will always make us smile. To celebrate the new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/copo-camaro-zl1-hemi-cuda/">COPO Camaro</a>, here are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/copo-camaro-buick-gs-stage-1/">some COPOs</a> on Motorious, not just limited to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1979-camaro-stolen-ontario/">Camaro</a>.</p>

<p>Chevrolet did the unthinkable in 2012 when it created a short run of the true <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/113118/2012-chevrolet-camaro-copo">quickest Camaros</a> to ever to come from the factory.  So when you can get your hands on an ultra-rare instant-icon COPO Camaro that features a 750 hp 427 V8, then you know this is a truly special moment. This is one of only 69 cars that started it all.  The COPO <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fire-kills-fourth-gen-camaro-z28/">Camaro</a> program was never anything official from Chevrolet until this moment, and it was never anything as wild as this.  These were the rare few that were built specifically for NHRA competition.  Oh yes, they're too wild for production VINs or to be registered on the streets.</p>

<p>It happens every time: a manufacturer decides to build a car to go racing but most of them end up in the hands of collectors. Chevy joined the party with <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/162135/2013-chevrolet-camaro-copo">the COPO Camaro</a>, a purpose-built car for NHRA Stock Eliminator for Super Stock classes. Stripped down and built for combat, they didn't even receive VINs and are not street-legal. Oh, and they only built 69 of the COPO's of which only 20 were CRC's (Certified Race Chassis) body in white, all sold through Richard Rawlings of Gas Monkey Garage. Yeah, that sounds like a recipe for a must-have instant collectable to me. This is COPO number CRC08, and it's still brand new, in the wrapper and has never been on the track.</p>
