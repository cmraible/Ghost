Back in 2005, this Italian sports car had the body, paint, and chrome work carried out along with a replacement windshield. In preparation to sell, a headlight motor with a revised gear was also installed. Further complementing the exterior is a set of staggered 17-inch wheels (reminiscent of the stock 15-inch Campagnolos) wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport rubber (245/40 front, 335/35 rear) that partially hide Wilwood disc brakes with multi-piston calipers all around."

          "Powering this black beauty is mid-mounted 355-cubic-inch V8 engine built by Rich’s Automotive Machine Shop in cooperation with Smith-Dawson in December 1993. Mechanical highlights include a .020″ overbore, aluminum SVO Cleveland heads, a Windsor bottom end, Wiseco pistons, a Mallory distributor, and an aftermarket radiator. Even more, the engine is topped with a four-barrel Holley carburetor that sits atop a polished aluminum intake manifold. Shifting power down to the rear wheels and twisting a limited-slip differential and Spicer axle shafts is a 5-speed ZF manual transaxle housed in a polished case. A new high-torque starter was installed to prepare the car to sell. The car was dyno-tested in 1994 where its best run produced 393-horsepower at 6,000-rpm and 366 lb/ft of torque at 4,250-rpm. "

          "Open the doors to reveal an immaculate interior with seats and armrests reupholstered in Porsche black leather (in 2005). Also black to match the upholstery is the black dash, door panels, and carpets. The cabin is kept nice and comfortable thanks to air conditioning, and power windows roll up and down with the touch of a button with the window lifts and motors replaced back in 2006. More interior features include the aluminum shift knob and gate, a flat-bottomed Sparco steering wheel with a DeTomaso horn button, and a polished hub adapter. Instrumentation in front of the driver includes a 200-mph speedometer and a 5,800-rpm redline tachometer. Housed in a carbon fiber surround in the center stack are the gauges to monitor amperage, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure. While the five-digit odometer reads about 39,000 miles, the total mileage is unknown. The current owner had the car for about 10 years and only accumulated about 2,500 on the clock."
