<p>Looking just <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/immaculate-1964-jaguar-e-type-series-i-available-now/">immaculate</a> from every angle, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1961-austin-healey-bt7-3000/">Big Healey</a> has been restored to its finest details. This is the kind of car you can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-sunbeam-tiger-auction/">take to a competitive show and not be the least bit ashamed</a>, but instead stand next to it the entire time with a deep sense of pride.</p>

<p>As you can most definitely tell, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rotisserie-restored-1959/">Austin-Healey 3000</a> MkII BJ7 went through an exhaustive restoration. That process began back in 2017 and involved the body being stripped to bare metal. Thankfully, the required rust repair was minimal. What you see now is Colorado Red over black, the original color scheme this car had when it was brand new. Just like back in the day, this car wears wire wheels and the appropriate amount of chrome, which all shines perfectly in the sunlight. A black tonneau cover ensures this roadster can be enjoyed in questionable weather, although you’ll probably not want to take it out during a storm lest it suffer any damage to that show-stopper exterior.</p>

<p>While the interior of any classic vehicle is important, on a roadster like this one it’s more visible, so getting it right is essential. Black upholstery has red accent piping, creating a strong connection with the body. All the controls are original, including the US speedometer and overdrive.</p>

<p>Now with an essentially perfect exterior and interior, you’re probably thinking this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1961-austin-healey-bt7-3000/">Austin-Healey</a> has some mechanical issues, but the seller says that’s not so. The numbers-matching engine and transmission have been rebuilt. All the other mechanical and electrical systems have either been rebuilt or replaced, ensuring this roadster purrs like a kitten. The work was finished in 2020 and the seller says only break-in miles have been put on it since, so it’s as cherry as it looks.</p>
