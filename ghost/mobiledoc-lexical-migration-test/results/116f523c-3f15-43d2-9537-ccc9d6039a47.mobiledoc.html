<p>We don't spend nearly enough time talking about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-class-of-57/">cars from the 1950s</a> here on Motorious. It's not that we don't love <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-hot-rod-stretches-legs/">classic American Iron</a> of that era – they just tend to get lost in the shuffle of muscle cars, exotics, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/three-1985-american-muscle-cars/">late-model performance</a>.</p>
<p>Well, that's going to change. We combed through our inventory and found one of the most quintessential '50s cars ever. It's got it all: two-tone pastel paint, whitewalls, and miles of chrome.</p>

<p>It's a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213666/1956-buick-roadmaster">1956 Buick Roadmaster convertible</a>. We miss when cars had evocative names like "Roadmaster," "Skyliner," and "Turnpike Cruiser." Those names sure beat the dull, soulless alphanumeric names of many modern cars.</p>
<p>This gorgeous Roadmaster has traveled just 104 miles since a painstaking, frame-off, nut-and-bolt restoration. Every detail of this car is just as it left the factory in 1956 – or better, in many cases.</p>

<p>The only deviation from stock appears to be the set of knock-off wire wheels from a Buick Skylark. This was likely a popular dealer option back in the day. They look terrific on this Roadmaster, and we wouldn't change them.</p>
<p>We're also big fans of the two-tone pink and white paint, as well as the "tuxedo" black and white interior. Buick calls this color "Tahiti Coral."</p>

<p>This car was pretty loaded back in 1956, and its options make it a nice crusier today. it's got power everything – power steering, power brakes, power windows, a power seat, and a power top. It's also got factory air conditioning.</p>
<p>We'd love to have this '50s classic in the garage. If you'd like to add it to yours, you can find it at <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213666/1956-buick-roadmaster">GAA Classic Car Auctions</a> in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>
