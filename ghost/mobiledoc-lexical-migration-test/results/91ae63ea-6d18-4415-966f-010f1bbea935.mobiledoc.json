From classic to modern, the idea is affordable performance, for the ‘every man’ driver who wants to go fast, without investing in Italian supercars. These inspiring cars were sometimes evolutions of concepts, and sometimes concepts tried to recapture the magic of the muscle car, but never quite made it to fruition. Either way, here are some muscle car concepts that are worth your attention."

          "When the Dodge Charger went into production for the 1966 year model, it was largely based on the 1965 Dodge Charger II concept. When it was time to roll into the second-generation of the Charger, it inspired the concept dubbed the Dodge Charger III. This is clearly not the car that made it into production, and while interesting, we're grateful that ended up being the case. The iconic looks of the second-generation is much preferable ot this Sting Ray/Pantera/spaceship on oversized wheels and tires."

It was better equipped to make it tougher competition in higher-end muscle and sports car markets, but only one car, a concept rescued from a crash, made it to the roads. It's unknown where the concept is now after it failed to sell at auction in 2013, but we have a feeling it will pop back up on the market at some point."
