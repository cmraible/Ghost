          "A lot of things have been put off because of covid, including Renee Brinkerhoff completing her Project 356 World Rally Tour using her 1956 Porsche 356 A. Well, after a two-year delay the wait is almost over and the modified classic sports car has been revealed. Sporting skis up front and tracks in the rear, the modifications are entirely necessary since Brinkerhoff will be driving 356 miles across Antarctica. Considering the continent has been growing lately, that’s not nearly enough to traverse the entire thing, but it’s plenty of rough traveling for a classic car."

Other changes have been made to the naturally-aspirated classic sports car to successfully deal with the cold, harsh conditions in the Antarctic."

The Project 356 World Rally Tour has seen Brinkerhoff drive the Porsche over all kinds of crazy terrain around the globe. This is the final leg of the amazing journey, which is being used to raise almost half a million dollars for human trafficking victims worldwide."
