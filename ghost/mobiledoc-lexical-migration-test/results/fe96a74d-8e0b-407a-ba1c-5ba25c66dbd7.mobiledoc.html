<hr>
<p>Bad things happen to good people, which is why we’re willing to give the benefit of a doubt to the owner of this rather <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wildfires-destroy-classic-cars/">crispy looking</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-dodge-challenger-3/">1970 Dodge Challenger</a>. It’s listed on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/craigslist-1980-chevy-corvette/">Craigslist</a> in Los Angeles, but we guarantee it’s not nearly as hot as it was during a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-community-steps-up/">garage fire</a>. At least, that’s the explanation the owner is giving for why this classic Mopar muscle car has been burned severely.</p>
<blockquote><em>Remember the gas hoarding fires <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/gas-hoarding-leads-car-fires/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, anyone who takes a chance on <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjE5NzAiLCJEb2RnZSIsImNoYWxsZW5nZXIiXX0=">this Dodge</a> is going to be assuming quite a bit of risk. While it comes with a clean title from the 80s, which is pretty funny, We’re not sure how solid everything which wasn’t burned up entirely by the fire is at this point. Keep in mind, garage fires can get pretty hot, possibly melting anything metal so when it cools again it doesn’t provide the same kind of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/gas-hoarding-leads-car-fires/">structural integrity</a>. Everything on this ride will have to be gone over with a fine-tooth comb.</p>

<p>According to the seller the frame and most of the floor are still good, so there’s that. The 318 under the hood obviously isn’t running, so you’ll have to figure that out, too. According to the ad, there’s an auto slapstick as well, but again you don’t know what kind of condition it’s really in.</p>

<p>Sadly, the seller claims this was a factory Plum Crazy car. You could go the tough, long route of bringing it back to its full glory. The seller points out it would make a good rat rod or roadkill project car, so you could go that route.</p>

<p>Finally, the seller says the car “does not roll very well.” We can’t imagine why. Also, it’s no longer in the California DMV system. Would you take a big chance on this thing? Or would you go with a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjE5NzAiLCJEb2RnZSIsImNoYWxsZW5nZXIiXX0=">different ’70 Challenger</a>? The seller is asking $7,000 but do you think that’s a fair price, all things considered? Let us know in the comments.</p>
