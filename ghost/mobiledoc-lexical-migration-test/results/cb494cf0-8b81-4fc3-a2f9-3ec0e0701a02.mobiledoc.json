Why it wasn’t at least stored in a hanger isn’t apparent, but the harshness of the Land of Enchantment’s notorious sunshine, combined with desert winds and plenty of dust, hasn’t been kind to the ol’ bird."

Since the rock star only owned the plane for about a year, the red velvet seats, rich wood paneling, gold accents, and other appointments all look fantastic. Complete with a period-correct entertainment system and Kenmore microwave, one gets the feeling of being transported back to 1976 just stepping inside."

Adjusted for inflation, which is quite the moving target these days, that would be about $4,520,000 in today’s dollars. That’s quite the drop in value, probably in part because of the sad shape of the exterior. What’s really interesting is back in 2017 businessman Jim Gagliardi reportedly paid $430,000 for the aircraft. Not included in the sale were any engines or replacement parts, with plenty of the cockpit controls and instruments stripped."
