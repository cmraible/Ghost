<p>The wait is finally over! Nintendo has recently spoken out about the Switch Online Service and what it will entail. So, letâ€™s get straight into itâ€¦</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Cloud Saves</h2>
<p>The Nintendo community has been begging for this for quite some time now, but this is a case of better late than never. We will soon be able to save all of our save data to the cloud. IGNâ€™s Brian Altano had unfortunately lost ALL of his save data when he had to send in his Switch to repair, but we can all rest easy knowing that that will no longer be an issue come September.</p>

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I sent my Switch to <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NintendoAmerica</a> for repairs (it stopped connecting to the dock) hoping they'd do a system transfer to a new Switch for me.</p>
    <p>Instead, they lost ALL of my save data for my dozens of Switch games (Zelda, Mario etc)</p>

<h2>Online Play</h2>
<p>We all knew this already, but Nintendo reinstated that you will need the online membership to play Splatoon 2, ARMS, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Tennis Aces, and Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido online. That being said, Nintendo did state that the service may not be necessary to have to play every game online (presumably third-party titles and smaller games).</p>

<p>Finally! Nintendo revealed the initial round of games that will be offered in September. Nintendo also reconfirmed that classic games will have online play for the first time ever (like I needed another reason to rebuy all of these games). These games include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ice Climber</li>
    <li>The Legend of Zelda</li>
    <li>Balloon Fight</li>
    <li>Soccer</li>
    <li>Tennis</li>
    <li>Mario Bros.</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
    <li>Dr. Mario</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros. 3</li>
    <li>Donkey Kong</li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo will also be adding an addition ten games in the future and we are hoping for more games and platforms very soon.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Family Plan</h2>
<p>Whilst the purchase may be commonly purchased for just one account, you can now purchase a family plan that allows you to link up to EIGHT accounts to the one purchase. At the moment, Nintendo also specified that the Family Plan (12 months) will be $34.99USD, whilst one month is $3.99USD, three months is $7.99USD and 12 months is $19.99USD.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>The Restâ€¦</h2>
<p>Nintendo reiterated that the Switch Online Service will provide exclusive discounts. There was also no mention of any changes to the Switch Online mobile app.</p>
