The guy then just goes off about how the water he jumped and drove through on multiple occasions, which he documented on his YouTube channel, is at most 12 inches deep and so it must not be a habitat of any kind. He’s never seen fish or turtles, so his argument is just so like airtight and stuff, you know? Seems like a weird thing to say, but as you can see starting at about 7:00 in the included video he makes that argument most passionately."
