<p>Although successful in bringing attention to both <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/10725/1966-Ford-Shelby-GT350H?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=article%202">Hertz and Shelby</a>, this program was rather brief and in all only 800 cars were made with the iconic black and gold livery and an automatic transmission. One of those cars made its way to Littleton, CO where it was used by Hertz Corp. as a rental. It was then purchased by a private party the following year. From 1967 to current day, <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/10725/1966-Ford-Shelby-GT350H?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=article%202">the car</a> has remained in a private Shelby collection where it has been well-maintained and modestly driven.

<p>Some time back, <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/10725/1966-Ford-Shelby-GT350H?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=article%202">the GT350H</a> Rent a Racer was put through a rotisserie restoration. Being completely restored, right down to the very last nut and bolt, the car is exactly as it was intended to be straight from the factory. Since completion, this Shelby GT350H has seen very few miles. Other features include a black interior and factory Magnum 500 wheels. In addition to being of a certain caliber, the restoration was also well documented and a photo album does accompany the car which is also documented in the Shelby registry. </p>
