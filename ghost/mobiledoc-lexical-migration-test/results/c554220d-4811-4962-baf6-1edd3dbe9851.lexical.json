He and Chasten watch glumly as the South Carolina returns roll in, go up on stage for the last time, and receive the customary phone calls from Joe, Jill Biden, and Obama — all to the cloying deployment of a song, Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day,” that is simply too good for this documentary. Game Over — until next time, that is.",
