          " in 1969 and 1970, GM created aero-friendly body mods for the Grand Prix 2+2 (and Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe) to go up against the sleeker Ford Thunderbird. The exclusive modifications included a redesigned nose, a fastback-style bubble rear glass and a shorter rear decklid with an integrated spoiler. Interestingly, the rear glass used on the Grand Prix 2+2 and the Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe are similar but not interchangeable. Thia longer rear glass and shorter decklid made the trunk opening ridiculously small, but this car still hauled where it needed to... on the track!"

They all wear the same silver-over-dark-gray paint job with a red stripe and \"Pontiac 2+2\" door decals as well as 15-inch Rally wheels wrapped in Goodyear Eagle GT tires. Inside, all Grand Prix 2+2 coupes came with the same gray cloth interior loaded with all the options, and under the hood, the 2+2s were only equipped with the Grand Prix's 5.0-liter V8 rated at 165 horsepower and paired to an automatic transmission. This one remains incredible condition with just 30,000 miles showing on the odometer."
