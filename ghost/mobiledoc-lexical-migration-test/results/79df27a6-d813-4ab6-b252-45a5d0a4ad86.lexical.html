<p>The <a href="https://cobraexperience.tapkat.org/win289fiacobra?promo=FIA9">289 FIA Cobra Roadsters </a>were advanced race cars that featured a new dashboard, widened front and rear fenders, cut-back doors, new dampers, Halibrand pin-drive wheels, and engine and differential oil coolers. Due to FIA regulations, the trunk features "nubs" to provide sufficient space to fit the FIA suitcase.</p>
<p>Powering the <a href="https://cobraexperience.tapkat.org/win289fiacobra?promo=FIA9">Cobra</a> is a 302-cubic-inch V8 engine that has been bored and stroked to 363ci) and features 4 Weber carburetors with velocity stacks, aluminum heazds, a hydraulic roller camshaft, "R" valve covers, ceramic-coated headers and side pipes, and an aluminum single-core Hi-performance radiator.

With everything combined, this Cobra roadster generates 500-horsepower and 450 lb/ft of torque. </p>
<p>Handling comes from the Shelby suspension with Transverse Leaf Springs in the front and back, and stopping power comes from Shelby brake scoops and high-performance racing disc brakes all around. Keeping the fuel thirst quenched is a pressure-tested 17-gallon SS fuel tank and fuel gauge.</p>
