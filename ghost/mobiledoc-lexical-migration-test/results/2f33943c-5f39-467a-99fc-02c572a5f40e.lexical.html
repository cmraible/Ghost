<p>Travis Barker has amassed an impressive rock and roll career as the drummer for Blink-182, and his collection of classic and vintage vehicles backs up his <a href="https://www.autoclassics.com/tag/celebrity/">celebrity </a>status. Barker was present while three amazing vehicles were auctioned off at no reserve during Barrett-Jackson's 2020 Scottsdale event, and each has a unique style and distinct character.</p>

<p><strong>1960 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Cadillac/Coupe%20DeVille" rel="nofollow"><strong>Cadillac Coupe de Ville</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>The coolest of these cars is the custom 1960 Cadillac Coupe de Ville that has just 34,000 original miles on it, but there's little original left on this Caddy. For starters, the car has been chopped, shaved and lowered, and it packs a monster 454 CID V8 under the hood. Inside, there's gorgeous cream-colored with a modern touch thanks to the Dakota Digital gauges.</p>
<p><strong>Sale price:</strong> $61,600.</p>

<p><strong>1972 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Blazer" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chevrolet K5 Blazer</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum as this low-riding Cadillac, Barker's custom 1972 Chevrolet K5 Blazer is riding high with a lifted suspension and meaty 35x12.50-inch tires. A matte gunmetal gray paint job is accented by plenty of black trim, and the custom interior has been upgraded with black leather bucket seats, air conditioning and its own set of modern Dakota Digital gauges. Power this beast is a beast of engine with a 525 CID LS3 V8 surely providing more power than this Blazer will ever need.</p>
<p><strong>Sale price:</strong> $93,500.</p>

<p><strong>1941 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Cadillac/Series%2062" rel="nofollow"><strong>Cadillac Series 62 Deluxe</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>While the above two vehicles have been highly customized, Barker's 1941 Cadillac Series 62 Deluxe Convertible is all original. Everything about this car is just as it came back in 1941 from the Lancaster Gray paint to the red leather and carpets; even the gray floor mats are original to this car! As the cherry on top, this Cadillac even has its original 346 CID V8 engine and 3-speed manual transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Sale price:</strong> $52,800.</p>
