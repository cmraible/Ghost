<p>It should come as no surprise that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/shaq-gets-charger-hellcat-for-50th/">Shaquille O'Neal</a> is quite a wealthy man and being a competitive athlete, has a pretty high taste for cars of all sorts. he has big trucks, likely to make him feel normal-sized, Sleek sports cars that let him achieve incredible speeds, and luxury Cruisers for when the road is rough and it's time to relax. you might be thinking that every celebrity has an impressive Automotive collection and that Shaq isn't an exception to that rule. However, it is just the type of vehicle you might never expect to see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/shaq-ferrari-f355-seized-for-sale/">Shaquille O'Neal</a> driving around in that makes his collection special.</p>

<p>The first of these unexpected automobiles have to be his gorgeous Ferrari F355 Spyder, a beautiful sports car that you typically wouldn't see a taller person behind the wheel of. Because Shaq is 7’ 1'' tall and 325 lbs, the factory fuel tank was removed in favor of a font-mounted model. This allowed for better legroom and more even weight distribution. Overall, this, along with the Lamborghini Gallardo are both pretty wild options considering Shaq’s stature.</p>

<p>One automobile that does seem to fit him incredibly well is his custom Ford F-650 which is one of the brand’s largest pickup trucks. Under the hood is a Turbodeisle V8 engine putting out 300 horsepower which certainly isn't the fastest powerhouse on the road but still gets the job done. Finally, you have to admire the Charger Hellcat, a stark contrast to the aforementioned truck with 707 horsepower bursting from its 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8. Overall, Shaq has good taste when it comes to cars which is exactly what makes his collection special.</p>
