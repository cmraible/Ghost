In 1983, the car made its way to Old Lyme, Connecticut where a Callaway Turbosystems Stage II turbocharger was installed. As recent as 2013, the dealership that originally sold the car purchased it from the original owner. The car has enjoyed the road some but only has 19,000 actual miles on the clock."

          "Powering the car is a turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-four backed by a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission with a 'Street Comp' clutch. The Callaway turbocharger kit was rated at 200-horsepower, and that includes the thermostatic control, intercooler, Turbonetics wastegate, exhaust system, heat shielding, ducting, ignition-retard system, and Callaway valve cover. Handling on this car comes from a standard sport-tuned suspension and anti-sway bars in the front and rear. Stopping power comes from ventilated front disc brakes. In the paperwork provided from Callaway Turbosystems, it mentions the addition of an aftermarket front sway bar and lower stress bar. In July 2019, work was performed on the car such as a brake fluid flush, a valve adjustment, valve cover gasket replacement, shocks, and shift bushings. "
