Helping put that power to the road is a rear-mounted 7-speed dual-clutch transaxle. This car comes with the Pro package, which means revised tuning for the transmission, limited-slip differential, and dynamic engine mounts as well as adjustable coilovers for even better performance."

All that black also helps the forged twin-spoke alloy wheels really pop. Wrapped around those are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires to help take full advantage of the rear-axle steering feature and AMG High-Performance Ceramic Composite Braking System."

Black leather upholstery on seats with tall, supportive side bolsters keep you firmly planted in place. A flat-bottom steering wheel with center line adds to the motorsports-inspired vibe of this car, while the Burmester sound system and Comand infotainment make this the perfect ride for cruising around town or hitting the open road."
