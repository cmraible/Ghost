GM’s Lansing Grand River Plant was hit by quite the heist in the early morning hours of May 2. Thieves got away with five Chevy Camaros but police were hot on their trail. However, these guys put up a fight, using the performance advantage of the muscle cars to their advantage, leading law enforcement on a high-speed chase on I-96."

Stop sticks deflated the tires on a few, with some crashing. However, none of the suspects or the law enforcement officers pursuing them were hurt. That’s a win."

To nobody’s surprise, 8 of the suspects are from Detroit and one is from Saginaw. Perhaps they stole all the available Mopar muscle cars in the Motor City and decided to branch out in an ambitious move?"
