The deputy was unable to catch the speeding Charger, thanks in part to a Hyundai which tried running the law enforcement agent off the road twice. Unable to catch the Dodge, the sheriff’s department instead chased the Hyundai, which tried running over deputies who were setting up Stop Sticks on the interstate."

The driver of the Hyundai, 19-year-old Alma Rodriguez Dominguez, eventually got off the highway all the way into Phoenix and had to stop the crippled vehicle at 7th St. and Osborn, then was taken into custody. To the surprise of law enforcement, in the car were two suspect illegal aliens as well as the driver’s 18 month-old and 5 month-old children. Thankfully, the two babies weren’t hurt."

He says sometimes they keep drugs in one vehicle and people in another, but other times they’re smuggling people in both. Sometimes they even use one car purely as a decoy, drawing law enforcement from the goods transported in the other."

According to him, the drug cartels are recruiting youth and others to go down to the Mexico, pick up illegals, and transport them to Phoenix, paying between $1,000 and $2,000 per head."
