A set of TechArt fog lights are housed on the front, and it also has a protective film on the forward surfaces and rear quarters to protect it from any flying road debris. A set of refinished metallic gray 18-inch Technology hollow spoke turbo twist alloy wheels sit on all four corners and are wrapped with Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires (225/40 front, 285/30 back) which were added just 400 miles ago. Behind the wheels are aluminum brake calipers finished in red mated to cross-drilled and ventilated discs along with new brake pads all around."

The engine received rebuilt cylinder heads with enlarged SAI ports, re-sealed heads, and new case bolts, and a new clutch was installed at this same time. More mechanical highlights include a short-ratio gear set, motorsport steel synchros, 993 RS flywheel, Goldenrod short shifter, Fister Stage III muffler, RoW sway bars, lowered ride height, a Ruf steering wheel, Goldenrod short shift, and a classic Porsche stereo complete with navigation. Stabilization comes from a carbon fiber front strut tower bar that was added before the current owner."
