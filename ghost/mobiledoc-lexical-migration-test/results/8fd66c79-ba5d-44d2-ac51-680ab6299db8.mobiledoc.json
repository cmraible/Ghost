          ", Grams was so prominent in the car collector world that his bidder number with Mecum Auctions was no. 4! The Grams brothers got into cars at a young age when they started restoring old farm cars as teenagers, and the passion really hit high gear when they later sold one of their fixed up hot rods for $25,000. In recent years, Grams continued his desire of vehicle restoration and customization by creating \"whimsical curiosities\" from Model Ts including the Kodak camera car and circus car pictured below."

Bill Grams' passion for cars is obvious in the collection assembled in the museum as well as the classic and collectible cars offered up through Volo Auto Sales. The Volo Auto Museum is planning a memorial exhibit in Bill's honor. "
