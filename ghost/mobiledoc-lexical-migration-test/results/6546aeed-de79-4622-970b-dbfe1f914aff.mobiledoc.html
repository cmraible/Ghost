<h3 id="medicare-disadvantage">Medicare Disadvantage</h3>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/matthew-cunningham-cook/">Matthew Cunningham-Cook</a></p>
<p>This week, I <a href="__GHOST_URL__/why-is-aarp-boosting-medicare-privatization/">reported</a> on chicanery behind senior advocacy group AARP ‚Äî responsible for advocating for its 38 million members ‚Äî selling Medicare Advantage plans, and making up to $800 million last year while doing so. All the while, their advocacy arm in Washington is soft-pedaling any critiques of Medicare Advantage, while hospital lobbyists join public interest advocates in demanding reforms to the program.</p>
<p>Medicare, the government health insurance program for those over 64 as well as those with a disability status, is extraordinarily popular, with <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-covered-older-adults-are-satisfied-with-their-coverage-have-similar-access-to-care-as-privately-insured-adults-ages-50-to-64-and-fewer-report-cost-related-problems/">94 percent</a> of Medicare beneficiaries supporting the program. But Medicare Advantage, the for-profit version of Medicare, has proved to be detrimental to Medicare patients and taxpayers alike. A recent <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-18-00260.asp">report</a> by the Inspector General of the Health and Human Services Department found that 18 percent of claims denied by Medicare Advantage plans in one week in June 2019 were done so wrongfully. Meanwhile, these plans are systematically <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/11/21/1137500875/audit-medicare-advantage-overcharged-medicare?utm_campaign=storyshare&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social">overbilling</a> the government.</p>
<p>As of now, there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/upshot/medicare-advantage-fraud-allegations.html">29 million</a> Americans on Medicare Advantage ‚Äî or about 48 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. And that number is growing all the time: By next year, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/08/upshot/medicare-advantage-fraud-allegations.html">majority</a> of America‚Äôs seniors will be on these privatized Medicare plans. ¬†</p>
<p>Most corporate news outlets have avoided scrutinizing the growth of Medicare Advantage, likely deeming it not ‚Äúsexy‚Äù enough to capture attention or clicks. Maybe even worse, <em>The New York Times</em> recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/11/20/health/medicare-open-enrollment">covered</a> the differences between Medicare and Medicare Advantage in a fluffy service piece, blithely weighing the pros and cons of the wholesale privatization of one of the country‚Äôs most sacrosanct institutions in the same way it compares brands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/natori-bliss-underwear-black-friday-sale/">underwear</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-ice-scraper/">ice scrapers</a>.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>We don‚Äôt see it this way. We believe the wholesale privatization of the Medicare system would drastically strip away Medicare‚Äôs ability to negotiate prices with providers like hospitals and doctors and deliver that power to far more compromised private insurers. This arrangement would likely lead to even more price inflation for patients, who are already struggling with the fact that health care costs have <a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-spending-healthcare-changed-time/">doubled</a> since 2000, even after adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>This is why <em>The Lever</em> has made the privatization of Medicare one of our primary areas of coverage.</p>
<p>In <a href="__GHOST_URL__/seniors-medicare-benefits-are-being-privatized-without-consent/">March</a>, we covered how, with the advent of the new ‚ÄúACO REACH‚Äù program ‚Äî a rehash of a Trump era program ‚Äî seniors were seeing their Medicare benefits involuntarily privatized without their informed consent.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-wall-street-is-taking-over-medicare/">May</a>, we showed how many of the backers of this privatization scheme are owned by private equity or venture capital firms ‚Äî <a href="__GHOST_URL__/private-equity-gloats-over-a-doctor-glut/">another</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-wall-street-profits-off-of-the-sick-and-elderly-private-equity-nursing-homes/">key</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/wall-street-readies-an-avalanche-of-lies/">area</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/er-organization-admits-to-the-evils-of-private-equity/">of</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/workers-are-funding-the-war-on-themselves/">coverage</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/betting-on-a-wall-street-path-to-congress/">for</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/new-yorks-pension-reformer-goes-rogue/">us</a>. In <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-hikes-medicare-prices-and-funnels-profits-to-private-insurers/">June</a>, we revealed how the Biden administration had simultaneously hiked seniors‚Äô Medicare premiums by 14.5 percent, while also delivering an 8.5 percent payment hike to Medicare Advantage insurers.</p>

<p>In <a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-joins-the-medicare-privatization-spree/">July</a>, we reported on how Amazon‚Äôs $3.5 billion acquisition of One Medical, a major participant in ACO REACH, meant that Amazon was entering the Medicare privatization spree ‚Äî and throwing its epoch-making market power behind the effort.</p>
<p>In <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dr-oz-pushes-medicare-privatization-for-all/">August</a>, we reported how Mehmet Oz, the New Jersey TV doctor who ran for Senate in Pennsylvania, was pushing an aggressive effort to put all Americans on costly Medicare Advantage plans.</p>
<p>Fortunately, leaders like Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and organizations like <a href="https://pnhp.org/news/medicare-advantage-is-a-massive-scam/">Physicians for a National Healthcare Program</a> have stepped up their critiques of both Medicare Advantage and its ugly stepbrother, ACO REACH. In June, Jayapal joined with Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) to declare, ‚ÄúMedical negligence by [Medicare Advantage plans] is dangerous and deadly and must be stopped.‚Äù</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs unclear if this recent upsurge in criticism will be enough to stop the for-profit takeover of one of the country‚Äôs most vital programs for those in need. There must be more investigation, exposure, and analysis of the privatization scheme.</p>
