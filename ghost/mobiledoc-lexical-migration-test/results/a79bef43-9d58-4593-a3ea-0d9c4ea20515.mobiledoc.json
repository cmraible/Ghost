All of you car people, like myself, will know the name GT500 very well for this point and will also be excited to learn that this is an example of just that. Under the hood is a massive 428 V8 engine, capable of producing around 355 horsepower and similar torque numbers. Today it can be easy to think of that as not being extremely impressive but in 1967 that was virtually unheard of in a production car. Of course, the party doesn't stop at the flywheel either as the Shelby brand is dedicated to the pursuit of performance and a great driving experience. "

Beautifully, this transmission combines with the massive engine to support a drivetrain fit only for the most experienced classic car enthusiast. It should also be said that these vehicles are extremely valuable and often fetch somewhat ridiculous prices at auction which means that, provided you take care of it, this vehicle will be a great investment should you choose to think of it that way. Finally, this 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 is one of only 29 fastbacks made like it making it something only a lucky few will ever even see in person. Despite its rarity, you could now become the next driver to get behind the wheel of this GT500 but you had better hurry before another takes that place."
