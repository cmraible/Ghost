<p>A full restoration means this Chevy is a turn-key investment. Making this hot ride a real neck-breaker is the factory-correct <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-hugger-orange-muscle-cars/">Hugger Orange paint</a> job with white stripes. Thanks to a tedious painting process, the stripes are stripes are sealed under a clear coat, so they won’t wear off anytime soon. All brightwork is in excellent shape, ensuring this ride sparkles from bumper to bumper in the sunlight. Just as important, the body and sub-frame both don’t show any telltale signs of rust, which can be an expensive and frustrating battle to fight.</p>

<p>Unlike clones, which are quite common, this real Z/28 has a potent DZ code 302ci V8 engine. Matching the performance of that engine is a Muncie 4-speed transmission, Hurst shifter, plus a 12-bolt rear. You also get a performance suspension, quick-ratio steering, and performance brakes, meaning this ride is ready to show off on the track just as much as cruising down Main Street.</p>
<p>A fantastic interior is free of major blemishes, thanks to a full restoration. Every last detail has been addressed, from the tight-fitting headliner to the smooth and rich rosewood steering wheel. The radio appears to be the factory setup, but it’s an updated unit on the inside, so you have both AM and FM signal.</p>
<p>Considered by many to be the best year for the Camaro Z/28, 1969 models are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. It was made as a result of GM’s participation in the famous Trans Am race series, so you get a real track-worthy car for the street. For quite a few people, when they picture a classic American muscle car in their head, this is the vehicle that comes to mind. That kind of street credibility means this particular Camaro is a solid investment and valuable addition to your car collection.</p>
