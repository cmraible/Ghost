Aside from the obvious Bright Red paint job and white five-spoke wheels, this Corvette is also sporting \"ZR-1\" stickers across the hood and rear fenders. Not that the ZR-1 needed any more performance, but this car adds Corsa exhaust and Wilwood brakes with bright red calipers. This ZR-1 definitely won't be confused for one of the \"lesser\" Corvette models. In addition to its rarity and unique styling, this 1990 Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 is also special since it has just 40,000 miles on the odometer."

The doors, fenders and rear fascia were unique to the ZR-1, and the 1990 model year was the only year that combined this rounded rear end with the C4 Corvette's squared-off front end.
