<p>Finished in a stunning and <a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2020ShelbyGT500?promo=SHELBY6">eye-grabbing</a> Ford Performance Blue and adorned with white painted "over-the-top" white stripes, this Shelby is ready to make somebody's wish come true when it comes to owning one of the greatest Mustangs ever built. Equipped with the Carbon Fiber Track Package makes this car even more rare, and it is optioned with plenty of incredible GT500 features including exposed 20-inch carbon fiber wheels wrapped with Ford-spec Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 rubber (305/30/R20 front, 315/30/R20 rear), a GT4 carbon fiber track rear wing, carbon fiber rear diffuser, large front splitter and splitter wickers, and hood vent with rain tray. Driving at night is not an issue thanks to the HID headlamps complete with LED Signature Lighting. Another fun feature are the Shelby Cobra puddle lamps that illuminate at night, and turn signal mirrors give an extra heads up if switching lanes, among other things.</p>
<p>Powering to this potent <a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2020ShelbyGT500?promo=SHELBY6">Shelby GT5oo</a> is a supercharged 5.2-liter Cross Plane crank V8 engine that generates 760-horsepower and 625 lb/ft of torque. Shifting is handled by a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that sends power down to the rear wheels and twists a limited-slip Torsen differential that houses 3.73 gears. Sturdy enough to handle the amount of power produced by the Mustang is the addition of a composite carbon fiber driveshaft. Handling and planting the power to the ground is advanced independent rear suspension include the MagneRide damping system. </p>
<p>Stopping all of that insane power are massive Brembo brakes with 6-piston in the front, and 4-piston calipers out back, the most powerful brakes in a production Mustang. Equipped with performance aerodynamics and a race-built chassis, this new Shelby was born to impress. <a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2020ShelbyGT500?promo=SHELBY6">Added rumble</a> and performance come from the dual exhaust with active valves complete with quad tips. More features include a Magnesium tower to tower brace, updated chassis tuning, adjustable strut top mounts, and engine oil, transmission, and differential coolers. The car comes with a tire inflator and sealant kit and a full vehicle cover by WeatherShield that features the Shelby GT500 logo. With over 760 horses on tap, this car is ready to defeat any competition on the track or the road course. Not only will it dominate on the track, it can be driven all the way home in ultimate luxury and comfort. </p>
<p><a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2020ShelbyGT500?promo=SHELBY6">Open the doors</a> to an impressive interior with leather-trimmed Recaroâ„¢ Sport Seats up front with the back featuring a rear seat delete. Even more, this Shelby features the Technology Package with B&O Premium Sound System, and other goodies include a 12-inch LCD Digital Instrument Cluster complete with MyColor(R) and SYNC 3 through an 8-inch LCD touch screen.
