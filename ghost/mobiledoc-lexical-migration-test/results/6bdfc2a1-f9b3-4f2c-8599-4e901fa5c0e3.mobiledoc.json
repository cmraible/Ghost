This is truly the kind of thing nightmares are made of, but we’re sure all the executives who signed off on this thought it would be clever. Maybe the Alice in Wonderland theme sounded good on paper, but the end result of a man in a rabbit suit was just plain creepy."

Sure, the book is crazy compared to the Disney cartoon, but for some reason Ford thought making it more like an acid dream was a good idea. We can only imagine how many kids were frightened of the Easter Bunny for years after witnessing this atrocity."

We’re not saying it was the freaky commercial in the US which doomed the Falcon, because this television spot aired at the launch of the 1960 model year, but it probably didn’t help thing. We dug up a few commercials from Down Under and they’re far more normal, so there’s that."
