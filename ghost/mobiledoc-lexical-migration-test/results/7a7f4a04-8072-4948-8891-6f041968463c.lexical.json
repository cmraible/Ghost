Recently, Sean got the chance to sit down and talk with the guy about some of his more exotic vehicles, primarily consisting of Ferraris. While there are many cars of this nature in the Marconi collection, the one that caught our eyes, along with many enthusiasts, was the Ferrari F40.",

One of which is the wastegate, behind the passenger, and the seemingly instantaneous boost which kicks in hard and really makes you feel the rawness of the car. If you look through the comment section of that video you'll notice overwhelming support in favor of John as he seems to be a very knowledgeable enthusiast despite also being quite humble when talking about his beloved racing car. Even going so far as to ask permission from one of the cops while filming the car accelerating, you really get the feeling that this is the kind of person the F40 was made for. Someone who appreciates cars for what they are but doesn't let it go to his head. This is one of the best cars featured within the Marconi Auto collection and might even be the centerpiece depending on how you look at it. Either way it's good to know that such an incredible piece of Automotive History is being taken care of by a family that truly loves and appreciates every bit of engineering that went into making them iconic.",
