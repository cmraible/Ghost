<p>“Now in its 21st year, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/media-center/press-releases/am19_key-american-entries/745984">RM's 2019</a> Amelia Island sale is again set to reinforce the company's clear market leadership. In 2018, the single-day sale achieved $27.7 million with a strong 86 percent of all lots sold, with international attendance from bidders representing 32 countries.”</p>
<p>There’s so much to look forward to this year, as special themes and collections are being shown off. “The RM Sotheby’s Ocean Front Lawn at the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island has long been where collectors find some of the hobby’s most coveted American Classics,” says Gord Duff, Global Head of Auctions, RM Sotheby’s. “As we saw in Arizona, there is a sustained and perhaps renewed appetite for great pre-war Classics in today’s market, and we’re thrilled to bring collectors rare opportunities such as one of Fran Roxas’ final Duesenberg restoration projects, yet to be shown following completion, an as-pure-as-it-gets Packard Twelve Convertible Sedan Custom, and an Auburn Eight Custom Speedster—a Classic in high demand.”</p>
<p>As we saw earlier in the day, there are obviously many surprises in store for the auctions, so this will be a great one to watch. Check back with Motorious all weekend long to find out which cars sold for shocking amounts, and which ones didn’t get footing at all.
