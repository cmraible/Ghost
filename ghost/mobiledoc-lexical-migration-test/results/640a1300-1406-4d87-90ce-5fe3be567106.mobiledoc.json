To start, Apple added an excellent fingerprint scanner to the iPhone &#8212; which works wonderfully, unlocking your iPhone very quickly while keeping it secure.  The iPhone 5s camera is stellar coming in at 8 megapixels and has an excellent sensor built right in, plus it has a dual flash that makes using flash not-so-dreadful.  You can also do cool things like panoramas with the camera app.  The on-contract price is still the same, too, so picking up the newest iPhone means you’re paying the same price as you were last year.  The iPhone 5s is available in a silver, space gray, and gold, with the following storage options: 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at <strong>$199</strong> with a 2-year contract.  <a title=\"Buy an iPhone 5s\" href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone5s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy an iPhone 5s</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HTC-One1.png\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-22434\" alt=\"HTC-One\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HTC-One1.png\" width=\"173\" height=\"152\" /></a><strong>HTC One</strong></p>\n<p>The HTC One has received rave reviews across the web, its stylish and sleek aluminum chassis, super fast 1.7Ghz processor, 2GB of RAM, and brilliant-looking 4.7&#8243; 1080p screen are the types of features that stand out against its top Android-competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S4. The HTC One also features the revamped Sense UI 5 (which is an improvement to previous versions of Sense UI), great battery life, and other nifty features like NFC and Bluetooth 4.0.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at <strong>$129 </strong>with a 2-year contract.

The Galaxy S4 sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor clocked at 1.9Ghz, a stunning 5&#8243; display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, and 2GB RAM. The regular version comes in black or white, however, the Active versions of the smartphone have multiple colors and are also more durable. The S4 has storage options of 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB + has a microSD slot for expandable storage (up to 64GB). Nifty features include dual camera shot (lets you take a photo of people + yourself), S Health, S Translate, and Group Play (share music, files, etc).</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at <strong>$150</strong> with a 2-year contract.

This year’s edition, the Galaxy S III, is an impressive device for Android fans. A ridiculously large (4.8-inches) HD screen, and neat additions like NFC (near field communication) make the Galaxy S III the smartphone of choice for those who want a big phone and don’t necessarily want to be sandboxed into Apple’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at <strong>$19</strong> with a 2-year contract.  <a title=\"Buy a Samsung Galaxy S III\" href=\"http://wireless.amazon.com/b/404251011/ref=alohasearchnav_br_ph_gw/?keywords=samsung+galaxy+s+iii\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy a Samsung Galaxy S III</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Our other Buying Guides</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Buying Guide for Desktop &amp; Laptop Computers\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/buying-guide/computers/\">Desktop &amp; Laptop Computers</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Buying Guide for Tablets\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/buying-guide/tablets/\">Tablets</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Buying Guide for Cameras\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/buying-guide/cameras/\">Cameras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Buying Guide for Headphones\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/buying-guide/headphones/\">Headphones</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Buying Guide for Computer Speakers\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/buying-guide/computer-speakers/\">Computer Speakers</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Buying Guide for TV's\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/buying-guide/tv/\">TV&#8217;s</a></li>\n</ul>\n"
