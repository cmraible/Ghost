<p>Here's what's been getting feedback over the last few weeks…</p>
<h3 id="the-ai-chat-age-of-search">The AI chat age of search</h3>
<p>Former student and eConsultancy writer <em>extraordinaire</em><a href="https://econsultancy.com/rebecca-sentance/">Bex Sentance</a> left an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2023/02/googles-bard-sings-a-song-to-welcome-the-second-age-of-search/#ghost-comments">insightful comment</a> on my post about AI chat search:</p>
<blockquote>I wrote a piece recently on ChatGPT and the <a href="https://econsultancy.com/chatgpt-search-engine-threat/">benefits of conversational search</a> (linking because I'm proud of it, although it was published in mid-December, so it's a touch out of date), and as part of the research for it I looked up what percentage of searches are informational queries (i.e. queries that can be answered with a simple fact) rather than searches for websites. The weird part was that the most recent study, and stat, I could find, was from 2007.</blockquote>
<p>Given how much search has shifted in the 16 years since, that is a peculiar omission in the literature. But what there is remains interesting:</p><!--members-only-->
<blockquote><a href>…</a> but the percentage of informational searches (as determined by researchers Jansen, Booth and Spink) was estimated at 80% versus 10% of navigational queries and 10% that are transactional. That's a heavy, heavy skew towards the kind of queries that a(n accurate) chatbot could feasibly satisfy.</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, I must put my hand up and admit I forgot about transactional and purchase-related searches because it’s not in the mainstream of my SEO work — it’s more for the marketing folks. Like Bex, I would be fascinated to know what the balance is these days — and am fascinated to see that nobody is researching it. It feels like now would be a great time to do so, to give context for the coming changes.</p>
<h3 id="twitter-changes">Twitter changes</h3>
<p>Given how much journalists and other online publishing types are wedded to Twitter, it’s not a surprise that a lot of the feedback has been around the ongoing changes at Twitter. For example, <a href="https://theaddition.substack.com">Charlotte Henry</a> speaks for many when she says:</p>
<blockquote>I will be SO cross if Tweetdeck becomes a Twitter Blue-only feature.</blockquote>
<p>Oh, yes. So many of us will be.</p>
<p>Old Le Web friend <a href="https://arnehulstein.com/about/">Arne Hulstein</a> also had things to say:</p>
<blockquote>The whole Twitter thing is going to kill exactly what Twitter was good at. Not sure how long this is going to take, but it is going to happen. Twitter grew on the backs of platforms that carried their service. If that is going Blue only, the few that remain probably won't continue. I am interested to see if another platform steps up. These changes seem to be based on Elon's personal preferences, and I am not sure that they carry as much weight for the average user.</blockquote>
<p>He’s right. Whatever Musk is turning Twitter into, it will look very different from the one we used to know. I see some people online are now calling Musk’s version of the company Twitter 2.0. I think that’s fair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.disabilitydebrief.org">Peter Torres Fremlin</a> points out that there’s been a shift in the way we talk about government/social media connections:</p>
<blockquote>in <a href>TikTok’s </a>case, closeness to government is seen as negative, but in the case of twitter, it was, in the Arab spring, seen as good that the US govt was supporting the overthrow of governments otherwise seen as its friends :)</blockquote>
<p>To which I can only say, yup. We were much more naive back then, still locked in the techno utopian dream, and not looking hard enough for the potential downsides. Clandestine collusion between governments and social networks is something to be wary of, whoever’s doing it.</p>
<h3 id="an-alternative-mastodon-app">An alternative Mastodon app</h3>
<p>While on the subject of Twitter and alternatives, <a href="https://twitter.com/richardkendall?s=21&t=sdc_VHpHpf2ZJ8p013nbpw">Richard Kendall</a> recommends Ice Cubes, which I have been using on and off. It’s a lovely wee app, which is evolving very fast indeed. Well worth a look:</p>

<p>An essay and memoir from me earlier, responding to a <em>Press Gazette</em> piece on the rise and <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/magazines/lads-mags-the-rise-the-fall-and-the-curious-return-of-fhm/">fall of the Lads Mags</a> in the 1990s and early 2000s. Contains a photo of me as a 22 year old — be warned. </p>
