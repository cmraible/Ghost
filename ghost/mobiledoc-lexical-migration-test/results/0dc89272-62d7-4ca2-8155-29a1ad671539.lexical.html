<p>Three classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-nyc-garbage-truck/">trucks</a> have been stolen from a house in Hoschton, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/georgia-cops-chop-shop/">Georgia</a> and we’re asking everyone to keep an eye out for them.

<p>According to the Gwinnett County Police Department, officers responded to a call at the house on March 21. The owner said someone had <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/irish-influencer-range-rover/">burglarized the residence</a>, taking his 2022 Delta Tilt Trailer and the three classic trucks. Later, the trailer was recovered in Jackson County. However, the trucks have disappeared without a trace so police are turning to the public for help.</p>
<p>It seems like these days thieves are concentrating harder than ever on classic cars and trucks. Maybe thieves know classics can sit for days or weeks at a time without being used so the owners are less likely to happen upon them in the process of the theft? Or maybe it’s because classic vehicle prices have been on such a tear for the past few years?</p>
<p>We don’t know for sure, but we do know now is the time to add extra security for wherever you store your classics as well as on the cars themselves. Cameras, lights, kill switches, alarms, and GPS trackers are all good ideas. You might want to get creative and do something most thieves wouldn’t expect and can’t handle, too, as long as it’s legal.</p>
<p>Police are encouraging anyone who might have information about these stolen trucks to call Atlanta Crime Stoppers at 404-577-TIPS (8477) and use case number 23-0021961.</p>
