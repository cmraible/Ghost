<p>Built by Dodge to compete in the NHRA Factory Super Stock classes, the Dart M-Code was a factory-built force to be reckoned with. Only 640 of these cars were produced, but a mere 51 of these cars remain in the M-Code registry including this one. <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9610?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Carlisle Auctions</a> is pleased to offer this extremely rare and fully restored <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9610?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1969 Dodge Dart M-Code</a> to their upcoming auction lineup held on October 4-5, 2019.</p>

<p>Dodge called this rare classic the Dart GTS, but it was internally known as the <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9610?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">M-Code</a>. It was a factory street version of the Dodge GSS, or Grand Spaulding Sport, but it lacked power steering, the Dana rear-end, power or disc brakes, and the four-speed. However, the street-legal M-Code was given a special K-member, bespoke exhaust, new motor mounts, and modifications to the engine block among other things.</p>
<p>Under the hood of this rare <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9610?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Dart</a> is a rebuilt, period-correct Magnum 440cui V8 engine topped with a 4-BBL carburetor. Rated at a healthy 375-horsepower and 440 lb/ft of torque, power is shifted to the rear wheels via a 727 TorqueFlight transmission. The engine block is numbers-matching, and according to the listing, was saved from drag racing abuse.</p>

<p>Behind this Dart's doors is a white interior with no real frills. It does feature bucket seats, console,  floor-shifter, and a 120-mph speedometer in the dash.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9610?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious"> '69 Dart M-Code</a> could sprint from 0-60 mph in the low five-second range and conquer the quarter-mile in just a hair over 13 seconds at 107 mph. While Dodge continued to up the ante by producing a track-only 426 Hemi variant, the M-Code was still king of the street-legal Dart models.</p>
