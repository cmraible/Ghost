Arrgh.<p></p>
<p>I’ve only left my desk for about 10 minutes the whole day, and only achieved a fraction of what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>This, I suspect, is the downside of having a job you’re really passionate about. The highs are higher, but the lows are lower.</p>
<p>I just want to go home, dive into a bath of whisky and never come out again.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
