<p>We're likely the first generation in a long time that has associated Cadillac with a high performance image. The vanguard for that change was <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">the CTS-V</a>.</p>

<p>That V is a very important initial. In the case of <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">this particular car</a>, it signifies big brakes and a taut suspension. It also signifies a supercharged 6.2 liter V8 engine under the hood â€“ the same one you'll find under the hood of a C7 Corvette Z06.</p>
<p>That massive V8 is good for 640 horsepower and 630 lb/ft of torque. <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">The CTS-V</a> can go from zer to 60 in just 3.7 seconds on its way to a 200 mile per hour top speed.</p>

<p>All of this performance available in a car with four doors and a plush, comfortable interior. If Cadillac's goal was to build <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">an American BMW M5</a>, they succeeded and then some.</p>
<p>This CTS-V is <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS14">more special than most</a>. This is the Cadillac CTS-V Championship Edition, built to commemorate the 2017 IMSA Manufacturer, Driver, Team and Endurance Championships that Cadillac won. Now that's a clean sweep. We told you that Cadillac was serious about this whole "performance image" thing.</p>
