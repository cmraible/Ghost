<hr>
<p>Most people fortunate enough to own an unmolested <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fd-mazda-rx-7-fast-and-furious/">Mazda RX-7 FD</a> absolutely baby the sports car. After all, they weren’t exactly cheap when new and there are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/america-has-just-one-left-hand-drive-mazda-rx-7-spirit-r/">precious few</a> left in the US, so these rides can command top dollar in the right circles. That’s why seeing a low-mileage example that’s just sat in a dusty garage and become filthy is truly shocking.</p>

<p>The story about why this FD RX-7 was parked in a garage for so long is just as shocking. Apparently, the owner bought the thing brand new from a Mazda deal. After driving it about 8,800 miles he took it on a highway and pushed the thing to 140 mph. That’s when he became scared of the sports car, so instead of selling it he just stuck it in the garage and let it sit.</p>

<p>Yeah, that story sounds really weird to us for a few reasons, but it’s the only one we have. The identity of the owner was masked in the YouTube video, as was the license plate, so there’s no asking the guy any follow-up questions.</p>

<p>Overall, the condition of this Mazda RX-7 is impressive. The exterior <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/filthy-porsche-928-wash/">cleans up</a> rather nicely in the video, so the dust and grime which sat on it seemed to have a minimal effect. Sometimes the minerals in dirt can eat away at finish, paint, chrome, etc. which is why it’s recommended to keep any stored vehicle clean and hopefully in a dust-free environment.</p>

<p>After sitting in a garage undisturbed since the late 90s, this car has accumulated a mouse nest, several dead mice, and plenty of grime. Thankfully, the rodents hadn’t destroyed wires or anything else in the car. In fact, the interior looks fantastic once cleaned up. This might be one of the better-preserved FD RX-7s out there.</p>
