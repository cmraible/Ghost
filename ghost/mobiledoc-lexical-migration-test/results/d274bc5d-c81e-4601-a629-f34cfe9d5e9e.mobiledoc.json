Normally, a cashier's check indicates guaranteed funds from a bank, but in this case, a fraudulent check was used. In fact, the fake was so well done that even the bank (and the police) thought it was real until they went to verify the information."

It's a really clean-looking ’69 Camaro with a cowl-inducted hood, red side stripes and Torq Thrust wheels. According to the fender badges, this car’s packing a 350 CID V8, but not much more information was provided about the car.
