          "On November 14, 1966, this 1967 Chevrolet Corvette rolled off the assembly line in St. Louis, Missouri, and just 11 days later it was sold to its first owner in northern Wisconsin. This car had definitely lived an interesting life having spent time street racing in Wisconsin with its first owner, embarking on a cross-country trip with its second owner and even racing against Evel Knievel in Montana with its third owner. Over the years, this car lost its original top, its original engine and even had the front fenders cut to allow larger racing tires, but its extensively documented allowed the current seller to restore this 'Vette back to its original, factory-fresh glory."

          "Today, this '67 'Vette looks just like it did back in late 1966 thanks to a complete frame-off restoration resulting in multiple NCRS Top Flight awards and a Bloomington Gold award in 2018. The Marina Blue paint and factory hard top are accented by the factory white soft top, and the Bright Blue interior adds even more visual pop to this car. More importantly, the small-block 327 V8 that had made its way under the hood of this car was replaced by a factory-correct L-71 427 CID big-block V8 with its 435-horsepower output and glorious exhaust note rumbling from the factory side pipes."
