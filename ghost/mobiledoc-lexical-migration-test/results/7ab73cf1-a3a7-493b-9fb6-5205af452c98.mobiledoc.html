<p>I realised something early this year. It was a painful realisation, triggered by evidence that yet another pitch done by a Big Agency but involving me was likely to come to nothing. It’s been two years since this company managed to land me any paying work, and yet I keep plugging away at failed pitches because they’re a “big name”.</p>
<p>The pitches I make myself? The majority – well over 60% – land.</p>
<p>Here’s the realisation: after four years – <em>four years</em> – in self-employment I’m still letting others define what I do. I’m not telling my own story effectively enough other than when I pitch directly to people, so how can I expect others to sell me effectively? I need to take ownership of my work. I need to start communicating better what I do in places that people can see it, rather than relying on word of mouth.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have realised this a couple of months back when a long-standing friend approached me tentatively about some work, but he wasn’t clear exactly what it was that I do. If my friends – the people I interact with regularly on Facebook – aren’t aware of that, how can anyone else be?</p>
<p>So, what now?</p>
<h2 id="definemyself">Define myself</h2>
<p>I’ve always been wary of tying myself too close to existing labels – I’ve strongly resisted the “content strategist” tag, for a start – but I need to be able to clearly articulate to people what I can do for them – and why they would find it useful. That doesn’t lock me in stone – or put me in a box – unless I let it. Let’s get some definition into what I do.</p>
<p>As part of that, I need to think through <em>what it is I do</em>, and how that balances with what I’d like to do. I’ve evolved into someone who mixes writing with training, and I’m not altogether happy with that balance. I’d like to do more consultancy, not just training, and I’d like to take a better run at creating a business around the live event coverage model. There’s also an event idea that needs more time devoted to it.</p>
<p>If readjusting that balance means saying “no” to some unproductive pitches, or to low-value work, then so be it. I have four years of evidence that the work will come – I shouldn’t still be panicking about the next job when I have several lined up.</p>
<h2 id="promotemyself">Promote myself</h2>
<p>Probably the two biggest challenges in my self-employed life are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Promoting myself</li>
    <li>Invoicing</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m getting better at the latter one – and am taking some steps to improve even further. But I’m still awful at the former. At the <em>very least</em> this site needs a revamp, to allow people to see exactly what I do – beyond the blogging, of course.</p>
<p>There are several things I can do beyond that, but let’s not run before we can walk.</p>
<p>I’ve built a sustainable business. I’m good at what I do – and people seem to get value from it. Let’s see if I can put that in front of people in a more digestible form.</p>
<h2 id="theirony">The Irony</h2>
<p>There is a certainly irony implicit in the fact that much of the second step above, is merely practicing what I preach. Apply the same sort of content strategy, analytics and promotional methods I spend all my time helping people with to my own work. Walk the walk, Adam, walk the walk.</p>
<p>It’s all a better option than just buckling down and getting a “real job” again, or drifting along, letting my working life be defined by the whims of others, though.</p>
<p>So, that’s was my 2016 plan. It’s not a set of resolutions, as much as a set of “to-dos”, that I hope to have cleared way in the next few weeks. And I’ll see where that takes me.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
