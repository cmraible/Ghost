<hr>
<p>There’s no doubt the 1990s were a golden age for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">Japanese sports cars</a>. These days we don’t have too many left, especially since the current Toyota Supra is now a reskinned BMW Z4. But 20-plus years ago there were several great options on the market. The video accompanying this post compares some of the very best: the 1996 Toyota Supra Turbo, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-mazda-rx-7/">Mazda RX-7</a> Turbo, Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4, and Nissan 300ZX Turbo. These four sports cars were performance titans of their time, but each took a little bit different approach (okay, the FD RX-7 took a very different rotary approach).</p>
<p>Out of all four of these cars, if you want to pick up a clean example today, the Mk IV Supra is going to set you back the most. We’ve seen low-mileage Supra Turbos sell for six digits, but those are of course on the extreme end of things. Still, the legendary 2JZ motor and the car’s starring role in the first <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/all-electric-dodge-charger/"><em>Fast and Furious</em></a><em></em>movie have helped values absolutely soar.</p>
<p>Easily the next hottest collector car out of these four today is the FD RX-7. A sexy, svelte body, smooth and monstrous power from the rotary engine, and a near cult-like following have ensured it’s a powerhouse on the open market. There’s also the fact that Mazda might never again make a rotary-powered vehicle after the RX-8, only adding to the desirability of the FD, arguably the best RX-7 ever.</p>
<p>Depending on condition and options, you can pick up a gently-used Nissan 300ZX Turbo or Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4 for a shockingly low amount of cash. Plenty of people turn their noses up at these two because both brands have suffered from image problems in recent years, but drive either one and you’ll realize they’re special cars. These, along with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/custom-1996-mitsubishi-3000gt-spyder/">Dodge Stealth R/T</a> (a rebadged Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4) are some of the best 90s performance car bargains out there. Just don’t expect to wow everybody as you drive past, since many are ignorant about what these vehicles have to offer.</p>

<p>If you could chose one of these cars, which would it be? Do you think any of them are overrated or underrated? Do you think MotorWeek got it right back in 1996? Let us know in the comments.</p>
