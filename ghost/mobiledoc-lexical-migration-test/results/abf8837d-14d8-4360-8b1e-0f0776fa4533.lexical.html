<p>A rightful successor to the legendary 599, <a href="https://sandiego.ferraridealers.com/en_us/search-used-ferrari/2015/ferrari/f12berlinetta/2015_ferrari_f12berlinetta-ferrari_of_san_diego-ZFF74UFA0F0210800">the F12berlinetta</a> represented the next step up for the Italian automakerâ€™s forward mid-engined design. A sprint to 62-mph could be accomplished in exactly 3.1-seconds and the car was capable of beating its predecessor around the Fiorano test circuit by a full second.
