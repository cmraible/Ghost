<p>Welcome to Switchaboo, friend. We cover Nintendo news and reviews, primarily for Nintendo Switch and its games. You'll also find biographies of many significant people at Nintendo who became a great influence on the company.</p>
<p>I (David Liu) founded Switchaboo in 2017 and Alex Harding was Switchaboo's first writer (and so naturally falls into his current role of chief writer/editor for Switchaboo) but also its strongest advocate. Since then, we've worked together to bring you articles about topics that we hope you find as interesting as we do.</p>

<h3 id="david-liufounder-of-switchaboo">David Liu - Founder of Switchaboo</h3>
<p>Doctor by profession (not the PhD kind); Apple fanboy forever; and got to be #8 in Australia for <em>Mario Tennis Aces</em> at one stage. I founded Switchaboo out of a combination of love and impulse, though Alex has been the one that has kept me wanting to keep putting more into it over these years. I've written a few articles here and there and do digital things with the website. I've also been responsible for hiring and the business direction of Switchaboo, and combine forces with Alex to do the marketing together.</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Switch Game: </strong>Mario Tennis Aces<br><strong>Favourite Indie Game:</strong> Tough one! I'm super excited in the ones that haven't come out yet, like Soundfall.<br><strong>Favourite Game:</strong> Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</p>

<p>Conqueror of platforms; typing specialist; I go by many titles but Chief Writer/Editor at Switchaboo would have to be my favourite. I like a variety of games, whether it's playing the latest Nintendo release or a small indie dev's passion project, but I have a soft spot of 3D platformers. Nintendo and video game history have always been topics that's fascinated me. I graduated from The University of Adelaide in 2018, majoring in English and minoring in Japanese and I've now found myself going back, studying a Bachelor of Business in Digital Marketing and Communications.</p>

<p>Along the way, we've recruited more talented writers who are eager to share their thoughts and opinions on the gaming landscape.</p>
<h3 id="nathan-rudgewriter">Nathan Rudge - Writer</h3>
<p>I am a proud father of a mini Nintendo fan and an avid fan of the RPG genre as a whole with special love for JRPGs and turn-based games. Most of my available downtime is spent lost in thought with Dungeons and Dragons. Whether it be thinking about my character in my fortnightly game or building my own world and story to run for my friends, I spend way too long thinking about it. I was brought into the team here at Switchaboo by complete chance by winning a competition and then realising the person sending me the email happened to be an old friend from high school. ‘One Piece is too long’ is not a valid excuse to not start watching or reading it.</p>

<p>I love writing and I love video games, hence why I joined the team earlier in 2020! I’m more of a traditional/insular gamer in that I grew up in the 90’s (i.e. the pre-internet gaming era) and therefore rarely play online; I’m happier playing through a single player campaign on my own than online with a bunch of randoms! But that’s just me. I go weak at the knees for any Metroidvanias these days and much prefer games of that ilk over more linear games. I’m fortunate enough to work in the games industry in my day job too which is great fun. Based in the UK, I recently dug out all my old consoles to revisit some of my childhood classics on the SNES, Megadrive etc. Other hobbies/passions include football (as in soccer), craft beer and updating Wikipedia football/soccer pages. </p>

<h3 id="jake-mounseywriter-content-creator-video-editor">Jake Mounsey - Writer, Content Creator & Video Editor</h3>
<p>Amateur voice artist, aspiring musician, comedian and Switchaboo’s token cynic. With over ten years worth of experience in online content creation under my belt, I’m typically the go-to guy for Switchaboo’s gameplay videos. I have a real passion for RPGs, rhythm games, card games, kart racers and the occasional FPS. Outside of Switchaboo, I stream over on Twitch under the name <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jaxek15">Jaxek15</a>, I tend to stream the games I’m reviewing for the site (assuming I’m not under embargo, of course), so it’s a good way to see my raw first impressions of a game before the review gets published.</p>

<p>I like writing, reading and rambling about video games as much as I can get away with. Brazilian through and through, I just love sharing opinions and experiences and it is very fulfilling to have a place to do just that in Switchaboo. I aspire to push my writing into something bigger and have aspirations to publish my own books one day. In the meantime, I run Tabletop RPG campaigns on the side and write small side projects, plus game up a storm.</p>
<p>I <em>adore</em> Tabletop RPGS, fantasy novels, adventure games, and JRPGs. Being transported to a brand new world and being shown all the cool things that can happen in it are some of my greatest joys and make me feel like a kid all over again. Platinum is the best Pokémon game ever made.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Switch Game: </strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild<br><strong>Favorite indie Game: </strong>Hades<br><strong>Favorite Game:</strong> Megaman Zero 3&4 / Okami (I can’t choose!)</p>
<h3 id="brian-stillwagonwriter">Brian Stillwagon - Writer</h3>
<p>I am a life-long video game enthusiast, aspiring novelist and all-round lover of the art of storytelling. I love to dissect and analyse media, especially video games, so I jumped on the chance to become a part of this wonderful group of people. My video game tastes are incredibly inclusive, put anything other than a major league sports game in front of me (anything with the acronyms) and I’ll play it for at least a few hours. I own every big name console except for an original PlayStation, PlayStation 4, and an Xbox Series X. Some day, I hope you’ll know my name by the books I will one day finish writing. </p>

<p>Hey, I am a huge Nintendo indie game player and fairly well known on Twitter thanks to me constantly posting on everything Nintendo related. I've written for a lot of different gaming-related sites and some you may know very well, including SwitchWatch, Rapid Reviews UK and dozens others. And here I am doing it again on Switchaboo. I've mostly worked in arts in my early years but now I'm currently working in fashion. It's not my dream job, but it pays the bills lol. </p>
<p><strong>Favourite Switch Game:</strong> Animal Crossing: New Horizons <br><strong>Favourite Indie Game:</strong> (There's been so many) Neon White, Mighty Goose to name a few. <br><strong>Favourite Game:</strong> Dying Light: Platinum Edition, Void Bastards and X-Morph Defence!</p>
<h3 id="dylan-covingtonwriter">Dylan Covington - Writer</h3>
<p>Accountant by day, gamer by later-in-the-day, a writer by sporadic times on the periphery of sleep. I joined Switchaboo shortly after graduating university, mainly because of my long-time <em>Nintendo Power </em>subscription and even longer-time love of telling others my opinion on media I’ve consumed. I live with my beautiful wife and an ever-fluctuating amount of pets in rural Kentucky where we add games, movies, books etc., to a nerdy stockpile of Smaugian proportions. I mainly play story-driven action adventure games and metroidvanias and in addition to writing for the site, I write memoir pieces, short stories and someday hope to complete a novel.</p>
