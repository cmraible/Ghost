Black fender flares and a hood scoop emblazoned with “Boss 302” as a callback to the legendary Mustang add to the high-impact effect. Chrome side mirror caps and polished alloy wheels keep everything from getting overly dark, which is a nice touch versus just going with blacked-out everything but the paint. Some accessories add to the trail-ready looks of this rig, like the bright red farm jack mounted behind the spare tire on the back, full roll cage, brush guard with four KC lights and a winch mounted on it, plus a nice two-row LED light bar mounted over the windshield."

The fact the front seats have five-point safety harnesses just demonstrates this is a ride intended to take on some extreme, risky trail runs. There’s also a fire extinguisher mounted to the roll cage, which you hopefully never have to use but will be grateful for if you do."
