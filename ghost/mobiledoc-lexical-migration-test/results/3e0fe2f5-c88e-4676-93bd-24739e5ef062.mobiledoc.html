<p>If I have one course that changes the way people work - it's this one. Understanding how to use analytics well is a critical part of making the most of digital journalism. Without those skills - you're working in the dark about what your readers really care about, and how well you're meeting that demand. This intensive course assumes no prior knowledge, and aims to get you confident and comfortable using analytics in your day-to-day work.</p>

<h3 id="24th-april-2019">24th April 2019</h3>
<p>One of my most popular courses — and one that gets consistently excited feedback. This is an all-too-rare opportunity to step away from the grind of producing journalism day-to-day and actually think about what sort of content is right for your audience - and how to plan it. </p>
<p>We'll dive deep into the complexities of the web, and how it changes content. We'll spend some time looking at workflows, and also at content planning and platform publishing. Attendees often feel it transforms their confidence in planning digital content — and manifestly improves their job. </p>

Search Engine Optimisation is firmly back on everyone's radar. However, search has changed dramatically over the last few years, and this one day course will get you right back up to speed. </p>

<p>The Facebook algorithm change early in 2018 and its dramatic impact on traffic to many websites has many publishers rethinking their audience strategies. We’ll cover the major referrers — search and social media — as well as ways of engaging more directly with your potential audience through tools like newsletters, podcasts and more. We’ll also explore the risks of depending entirely on social and search, and the new opportunities opening up in more direct approaches.</p>
