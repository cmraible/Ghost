<p>As gas prices continue to spike, conservatives, and liberals alike have surfaced proposals to help address the sticker shock, such as offering tax rebates for drivers and suspending gas taxes. But as we highlight below in this edition of Weekend Reader, there is another promising solution that has yet to enter the national debate: “Pay people to get out of their cars.”</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.curbed.com/2022/03/high-gas-prices-biden-green-new-deal.html"><strong>What If Joe Biden Paid You To Get Out Of Your Car?</strong></a> (Curbed) — <em>“A timely new report out Monday from the Green New Deal’s policy arm, the Climate + Community Project and the McHarg Center, lays out a framework for dramatically decarbonizing a typical American’s daily coming and going by 2030. It goes like this: Give people attractive alternatives to their solo commutes — people in the U.S. mostly drive alone in vehicles that emit 29 percent of U.S. carbon pollution with the highest per capita transportation emissions in the world — and help them dump their cars.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-police-lie-consequences-20220315-l4jubiydbvbg5l6iym7ln3sqdq-story.html"><strong>When Police Lies Fuel Racist Fearmongering</strong></a><strong></strong>(New York Daily News) — <em>“Police lie under oath so often there is a word for it: testilying. Some examples are high profile. The NYPD report about Eric Garner’s killing denied use of force. As in countless other cases, the person who legally filmed the police was arrested. Teenager Peter Colon, shot at point-blank range in the back by NYPD Officer Danny Acosta, was accused of holding a gun to an officer’s head (he didn’t). District attorneys vacated hundreds of convictions in 2021 after longtime NYPD narcotics cop Joseph Franco was caught framing someone on camera. Franco was previously accused of framing his victims, but it was his word against theirs. Facing lengthy sentences, they pled guilty.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://longreads.trust.org/item/bitcoin-mining-US-coal-country-climate"><strong>Coal To Crypto: The Gold Rush Bringing Bitcoin Miners To Kentucky</strong></a> (Thomson Reuters Foundation) — <em>“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or ‘mined’ by high-powered computers competing to solve complex mathematical puzzles. It is a process that guzzles energy and fuels planet-heating emissions, unless the machines run on power from renewable sources. Meanwhile, there is debate around how effectively such operations can replace jobs lost when coal mines and other fossil fuel businesses shut.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/03/15/how-this-tiny-christian-college-is-driving-the-rights-nationwide-against-public-schools/"><strong>How This Tiny Christian College Is Driving The Right’s Nationwide War Against Public Schools</strong></a><strong></strong>(Salon) — <em>“In an era of book bans, crusades against teaching about racism, and ever-widening proposals to punish teachers and librarians, Hillsdale is not just a central player, but a ready-made solution for conservatives who seek to reclaim an educational system they believe was ceded decades ago to liberal interests. The college has become a leading force in promoting a conservative and overtly Christian reading of American history and the U.S. Constitution. It opposes progressive education reforms in general and contemporary scholarship on inequality in particular. It has featured lectures describing the Jan. 6 insurrection as a hoax and Vladimir Putin as a ‘hero to populist conservatives around the world.’” </em></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/goldman-sachs-profits-ukraine-war-loophole-sanctions-rcna19584"><strong>How Goldman Sachs Profits From War In Ukraine, Loophole In Sanctions</strong></a><strong></strong>(NBC News) — <em>“As the Western world scrambles to defend Ukraine by locking down Russian money, the company is acting as a broker between Moscow’s creditors and U.S. investors, pitching clients on the opportunity to take advantage of Russia’s war-crippled economy by buying its debt securities low now and selling them high later… Goldman’s effort to profit from the war highlights the complexities the Biden administration faces in trying to punish Russia without harming Wall Street and the economies of the U.S. and its allies. And it is a stark reminder that no asset is too toxic to be traded when there are willing buyers, sellers, and brokers.”<br></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dg49z/antibiotic-resistant-salmonella-campylobacter-chicken"><strong>Superbug-Infected Chicken Is Being Sold All Over The US</strong></a><strong></strong>(Vice) —<strong></strong><em>“Campylobacter is America’s biggest cause of foodborne illness, just ahead of salmonella. Both are potentially fatal. Yet between 2015 and 2020, U.S. companies sold tens of thousands of meat products contaminated with campylobacter and salmonella, according to government sampling records obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. More than half of these were contaminated with antibiotic-resistant strains, a rapidly escalating issue that can be exacerbated by poor hygiene conditions. The poultry companies supply major grocery stores and fast-food chains. Tyson has supplied chicken to McDonald’s, Perdue has sold to Whole Foods, and both have supplied Walmart.”</em></li>
