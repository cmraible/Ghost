          "Under the hood of this insane 1970 Chevelle SS is a 454ci V8, the owner began this project with the idea of using an original SS model so he did. This cammed 454 is also sporting a pair of “old school” headers that the owner polished up and put on the car. Of course, you can't mention the car without also talking about the massive nitro capabilities that this thing is packing. According to the owner, the car can handle up to a 250 shot of nitrous, which is enough to blow away anything that might pull up to the line next to it, however, he typically runs a 100 shot for safety sake. The nitrous system is controlled with a digital box which also allows for two-step to be used on the car. Without the nitrous system the Chevelle is making about 400 horsepower to the wheels, however, torque is the main focus with this car with the engine rolling out 500 lb/ft of torque."

In the rear, the 17-inch wheels are wrapped in 325/45 racing tires and the front 20 inches wheels hanging on for dear life to the slim tires. The interior helps the car stand out at the leather seat covers complement the doors and dash very well. Allowing you to control the car is a brand new steering wheel and the automatic shift handle helps to cement the aesthetic of a fighter jet. This classic Chevelle, code-named Nitro SS, is one of the coolest Chevy restomods we’ve seen and we hope to cross paths with it again."
