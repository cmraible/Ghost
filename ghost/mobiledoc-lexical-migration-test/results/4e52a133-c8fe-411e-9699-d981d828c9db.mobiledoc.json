While every barn find motorcycle or car is different, oftentimes the tires have flat spots, rust is usually evident (this was near the coast, so even though in California that’s usually not much of an issue, it was here), and like in this case the saddle looks like it’s about to deteriorate if you were to dare to sit on it (although it thankfully doesn’t)."

With this vintage Harley the story is especially interesting since it used to be a California Highway Patrol vehicle. The officer who rode it during his time on the force bought the motorcycle when it was retired from the fleet. He rode it as his own pleasure cruiser. It’s really a cool story and in the video you get to see more photos and video of the bike."
