<hr>
<p>We all dream of being a hero spy when we are children, but let me ask you, have you ever dreamed of being the villain? Well if you have, I have the perfect car to soothe your wanting desires, this exquisite 1992 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/liberty-walk-twin-turbo-lamborghini-huracan-breathes-fire/">Lamborghini</a> Diablo, featured in the 2002 film <em>Die Another Day</em> starring Pierce Brosnan as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/aston-martin-db5-james-bond-continuation/">James Bond</a>, is for sale.</p>
<p>Being James Bond is all well and good, but today let’s not focus on the infamous super spy we all know and love, but rather his nemesis Sir Gustav Graves, and more importantly his car. This 1992 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/s-swapped-lamborghini-diablo/">Lamborghini Diablo</a> certainly lives up to its name with a roaring V12 at a displacement of 349.3 cubic inches - the hungry engine is cranking out 485-horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque. This Diablo is an obvious choice for any aspiring supervillain, and at a price of just $119,500.</p>
