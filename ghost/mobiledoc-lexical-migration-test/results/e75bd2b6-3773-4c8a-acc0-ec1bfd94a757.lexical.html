<p>Long-term readers will be familiar with my amusement watching social platforms tie themselves in knots <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2016/11/journalism-social-media-arbitration/">trying to decide who is a journalist</a> — and who isn't.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like Facebook is about to do that again. </p>
<p>It appears that it's going to be an inherited system: if you managed to get your Facebook Page through the verification process to be registered as a News Page, people working for that organisation can get journalist verification.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where that will leave freelancers, though. Given that they are the most vulnerable group of journalists, lacking the weight of a decent-sized publisher to back them up, that does seem like a serious oversight in a scheme whose stated purpose is to offer journalists more protection…</p>

<p>This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to how Google has been shifting in the past few years, but it does lay out the change very nicely.</p>
<p>The solution is simple: don't optimise for anything that can be answered simply. Optimise for in-depth explanations, contextualization and answers. </p>

<p>This court case is worth watching. We should, of course, be making things accessible wherever we can. But this could force any podcast producer to put more effort into accessibility. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ernestjournal.co.uk/ernest"><em>Ernest Journal</em></a> isn't new - but it's indie print media at its best. It's a great magazine for the the outdoors enthusiast, who is more curious than adrenaline-fueled — which describes me perfectly. Which is why I have a complete set:</p>

<p>The editor had built an interesting new model of partnering with one major sponsor each issue to help fund each issue — and then saw all that vanish when the COVID crisis hit. She's now running a crowdfunder to fund the production of issue 10. They funded in under 24 hours(!), and are now working on stretch goals to support the magazine into the future.</p>
<p>Well worth chucking some cash their way, if you love print and the great outdoors. </p>
