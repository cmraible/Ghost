<p><em>Jacob Gjørtz, VP marketing at CCI Europe, gave a talk at news:rewired in March 2019, discussing the shift to a mobile-dominant world, and addressing the challenges it brings for our story format. These are my liveblogged notes. </em></p>
<hr>
<p>52% of internet traffic is now on mobile. The average adult spends over two hours on their devices. News consumers “snack” - they spend about 12 minutes per session. How do we get them to spend longer on our stories?</p>
<p>One problem is that we’re still using a story format designed for an older device — paper. Pictures are there only as illustrations. It’s a format still focused on the words to tell the story.</p>
<p><em>Quartz</em> looked at that format, and came up with the <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/-smartden-why-quartz-does-not-publish-500-to-800-word-articles/s2/a554444/">Quartz Curve</a> - the split between stackable, shareable content, and the longer reads. The middle ground (500 to 800 words for <em>Quartz</em></em>- not the same everywhere) doesn’t engage the readers.</p>

<h2 id="linear-visual-story-formats">Linear Visual Story Formats</h2>
<p>So how about linear visual storytelling? It’s a swipe and scroll native format. It allows them to engage with the story in a much more natural way. Images are no longer illustrations, they’re narrative elements. They’re an engine of the story. There are various formats in this space:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/stories/">AMP Stories</a></strong>: a format invented by Google, designed for a good mobile experience. Lots of images, less text, scroll through it at will.</li>
    <li><strong>Timelines</strong>: a visual format with more of a balance between images and text, over a time-based scrollable format.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2018-07-prototyping-news-story-article-format-journalism">Expanders</a></strong>:  developed by the BBC - they are less image heavy, but allow users to "snack" on a short story or expand into further content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditionally, we create stories in fields, especially when working in a CMS. Could we break that down to small atomic elements: paragraphs, photos, embeds, etc? </p>
<p>Then you can take those elements and rebuild new stories in new formats out of them.</p>
