Well, I beg to differ. I was in rural Suffolk at the weekend, and attended the Halesworth Antiques Fair. I edited down the footage I shot and had it on YouTube in a matter of minutes:\n\n<object height=\"350\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nLFTrN6hlwY\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed height=\"350\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nLFTrN6hlwY\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\nAnd that’s a good thing to me. The point of most (but not all) web video is speed, rather than high-quality results. So yay Apple for iMovie ’08, and be prepared for more video from me..\n\n\n"
