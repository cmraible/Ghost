Among them is the Demon Crate, which includes 18-inch front wheels and an engine controller designed to squeeze the full potential out of the engine or 840-hp. Lightweighting abounds, there’s an advanced Launch mode which cuts fuel off to cylinders as needed, plus the transmission has a shorter 3.09:1 final-drive ratio designed for drag racing. The car can run on 100-plus-octane fuel with the Demon Crate, too."
