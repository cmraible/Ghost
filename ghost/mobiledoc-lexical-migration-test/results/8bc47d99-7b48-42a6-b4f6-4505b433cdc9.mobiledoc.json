It’s like every enthusiast’s dream come true, to stumble across a collection of vintage bikes which have sat undisturbed for a long time. There is floor after floor of complete motorcycles, engines, gas tanks, and many other parts scattered throughout the rooms like bodies strewn across a battlefield. Some of the bikes left behind could be worth small fortunes, yet they’ve just sat alone, gathering dust and rust."

This warehouse was purchased by a man who ran a successful motorcycle repair business. He would keep non-working bikes and parts in storage in the facility since he didn’t have room in his shop. Eventually, he sold the collection to another man who intended to keep the successful business running."

Now, if you’ve ever had to load a bike which hasn’t moved in a long time onto trailer, or even worse into a pickup bed, you know that can be a difficult task. Sure, some of these motorcycles probably don’t weigh much, but others look pretty hefty. Plus, there are hundreds of them. The logistics of transporting all of this stuff would be difficult to take on."
