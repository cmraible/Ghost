Factory rating for this car is 375-horsepower, plus there’s a 4-speed manual transmission and 4.10 rear axle. This is a pretty potent stock setup, although anyone could easily find fault and make excuses, especially if the Dodge doesn’t come off victorious. It’s also important to note this Challenger R/T weighs 3,856 lbs."

A 4-speed manual transmission is bolted up and there’s a 4.10 rear axle ratio, so you can see in that respect this Chevy is on even ground with the Mopar. However, the Camaro SS tips the scale at just 3,590 lbs. with the driver inside, giving it an edge."
