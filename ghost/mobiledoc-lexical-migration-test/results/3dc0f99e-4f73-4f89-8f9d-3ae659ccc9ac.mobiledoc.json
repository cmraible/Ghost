The reason cited was “a number of external factors, including supply chain issues and other matters beyond the company’s control.” GM made an effort to really penetrate the Russian market several years ago, but it fell flat and the company closed its manufacturing facilities there. Since then, the automaker has stuck to selling a few thousand Cadillacs and Chevrolets a year."

CEO Carlos Tavares said pulling out of the Russian market would only harm the Russian people and not Putin’s regime."
