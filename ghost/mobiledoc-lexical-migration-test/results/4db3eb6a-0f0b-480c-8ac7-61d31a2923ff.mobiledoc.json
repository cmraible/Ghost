The collision happened at about 1 pm on October 11 in Macomb County, Michigan. Sadly, police say the 34-year-old driver of the ‘Vette died after the accident."

However, he told the report on the scene that had he been leaning over at all instead of sitting straight up at the time of the collision, he believes he would’ve died. Looking at how the transformer landed, crushing most of the windshield, he’s probably right. Chalk it up to a miracle if you want, the guy is lucky to have survived."

We know from experience many people on the road love to tailgate and cut off commercial trucks, treating them like they’re a complete hinderance and nuisance. We don’t know all the details of this crash, and police are still investigating this, but it serves as a good reminder to not drive too fast or get overly aggressive with big trucks."
