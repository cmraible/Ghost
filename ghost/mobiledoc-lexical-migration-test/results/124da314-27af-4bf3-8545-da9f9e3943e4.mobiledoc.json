Painted LeMans Blue with silver hockey stripes and hood accents, chrome louvres on the rear fenders, and Ridler 17-inch black wheels combine for a sharp look. The black interior is mostly stock-looking, except the white-faced custom gauges and custom center console.  There’s a nice B&M Quicksilver shifter and a modern sound system, too."

You find a rebuilt 454ci V8 which was bored 30 over and contains a 540 lift Summit cam, Comp springs, big port heads, three-angle valve job, 10.25:1 compression, and a high-volume oil pump. An aluminum intake has been fitted up top with a dual-feed Holley carb. Backing up the engine is a Turbo 400 TCI Streetfighter automatic transmission. A fuel regulator with gauge, HEI ignition system, K&N air filter, BeCool aluminum radiator with two electric fans, high-volume water pump, and Hooker headers are also installed. Power steering and power brakes with four-wheel slotted disc make this an easier beast to wrangle. You should have a blast driving it hard."
