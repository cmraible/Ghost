Normally we don’t commemorate such sports milestones or even really think about them, but the creation of that team lead to the creation of some rare Dodge Chargers. Tom Kneer Dodge in Cincinnati decided to celebrate the team by creating a very limited run of Bengal Chargers. Now, one of the few believed to still be in existence has been discovered in Michigan."

He went with the black roof to match the players’ uniforms and Dodge threw in black stripes for those who wanted them. That appearance, combined with a special badge, really makes these stand out."

It might have stayed hidden from public view, however the garage the Dodge and a classic Ford Mustang shared started to collapse, so both had to be brought out into the driveway."

There’s also bubble wrap on the roof, protecting it from the hood stored there. That’s better than what we so often: boxes of random crap stacked all over a vehicle worth a small fortune."
