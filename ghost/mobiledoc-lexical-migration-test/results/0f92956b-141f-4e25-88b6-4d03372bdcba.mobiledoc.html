<p>A lot of people are going stir crazy sitting in their homes at the moment. And while take a drive in your car provides an out, cruising around is much better in a big vintage convertible like this <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/362/1971-pontiac-gto?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 Pontiac GTO</a>. If you’ve never seen one of these before or it’s been a long time there’s good reason: only 678 GTO convertibles were made by Pontiac for the 1971 model year. That makes this rare example very much a collectible, and you have a chance to make it yours through <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Raleigh Classic Car Auctions</a>.</p>

<p>A detailed restoration effort has left this GTO looking fantastic. The numbers-matching muscle car wears an attractive blue paint job, honeycomb wheels, rear wing, hood tach, all the other factory trimmings, plus a sparkling white soft top.</p>
<p>Speaking of sparkling white, the interior has plenty of it and there’s nary a stain or other blemish. The black dash and carpeting provide a good contrast, plus there’s a center console between the front bucket seats.</p>

<p>Under the ram air hood is the original 400ci V8 and behind that is the factory-installed Turbo 400 automatic transmission, just the way Pontiac intended it. The 3.55 rear axle helps put power to the ground and makes this a fun car for cruising around town or hitting the highway to let it stretch its legs some.</p>
<p>You get some comforts on this vintage Pontiac, including power steering and brakes, so no wrestling of this beast is required. Factory air conditioning is a nice perk for hot summer days. The AM/FM radio can keep you entertained during long drives.</p>
