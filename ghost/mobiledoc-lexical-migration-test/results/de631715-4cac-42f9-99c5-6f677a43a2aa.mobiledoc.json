As the truck passes the Holden on a narrow street, it hits the side mirror and crashes into the front fender, making tens of thousands of enthusiasts cringe. This is the kind of thing we have nightmares about."

The incident took place in a portion of Melbourne where the streets admittedly are incredibly narrow. With cars parked on both sides, even regular vehicles have to go over the center line into the opposing lane of traffic to get through."

Whoever is behind the wheel needs to be cautious when passing within inches of cars, buildings, or whatever."

We don’t know Melbourne well enough to confirm that, but we do know in some older areas of cities in the US there are similar problems. One solution is to allow parking only on one side of the street."
