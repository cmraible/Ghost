<p>As we announced a few weeks ago, we’re launching a regular film club, where we will be discussing the ramifications, messages, and ideologies of classic political movies.</p>
<p>And for our inaugural event tomorrow night at 7 pm ET (4pm PST), we will be exploring the 1992 political comedy <em>The Distinguished Gentleman</em>, starring Eddie Murphy:</p>

<p>While <em>The Distinguished Gentleman</em> does not appear to be on major streaming services, it can be obtained from your local library, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distinguished-Gentleman-Eddie-Murphy/dp/6305428441">purchased</a> cheaply online. You might be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV8cCcgaM8k">find a version</a> to watch on YouTube as well.</p>
<p>We will be joined by a very special guest: the film’s writer and executive producer, <strong>Marty Kaplan</strong>, a former Air America radio host who is now a professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and founding director of the Norman Lear Center for the study of the impact of entertainment on society.</p>
<p>To prepare for the event, please read this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/opinion/cash-and-crud-are-king.html">1990 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/opinion/cash-and-crud-are-king.html"><em>New York Times</em></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/opinion/cash-and-crud-are-king.html"> op-ed</a> that he published while working on the script of <em>The Distinguished Gentleman</em>. As Marty noted at the time,</p>
<blockquote>I have an unusually healthy appetite for politics. I lived in Washington for eight years, I've been involved in three Presidential campaigns and I watch C-span recreationally, so it isn't easy to turn my stomach.<br><br>But all the money, the PAC's, the ads, the posturing and the slime have finally gotten to me. I feel alienated — not by any particular candidate or party, because they're all complicit — but by the whole stinky system.<br><br>Small wonder people don't vote. I have always been pious about voting, so the message on my ballot stub was tailored for me. But I no longer feel the same anger toward people who don't. I can understand how turned off they feel, because I now feel it, too. The high school civics lessons about responsibility and participation ring hollow when cash and crud are king.</blockquote>
<p>The “cash and crud are king” phenomenon has gotten exponentially worse since Marty wrote that op-ed. During the 2020 U.S. election cycle, outside political groups spent $2.9 billion to sway voters, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/cycle_tots.php"><strong>400 times</strong></a> what they spent in 1990. We’ll be discussing this development and much more with Marty tomorrow night.</p>
