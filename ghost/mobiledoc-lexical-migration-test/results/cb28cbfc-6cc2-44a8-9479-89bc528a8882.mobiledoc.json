Before anyone gets worked up about how much this acquisition cost the taxpayer, the answer is zero since the sports car used to belong to an unnamed felony suspect. What’s more, the wrap, lighting, and other upfits were all paid for by the Escambia County Sheriff’s Foundation."

Someone made an air freshener in his likeness, which was hanging from the C7Z’s rearview mirror. That combined with the decorative wrap should clearly signal this Chevy isn’t going to be engaging in hot pursuits even though it could keep up with most suspects’ vehicles."

Instead, this is a beauty queen which will be used for community engagement, making appearances at different events to break the ice with the public. Most law enforcement agencies do such things, helping to personalize the officers, deputies, troopers, etc."

Others believe it’s a legitimate way of punishing those who break the law. And there are some who think it sometimes is good but other times is abused. We’ll let you decide where you fall on the issue."
