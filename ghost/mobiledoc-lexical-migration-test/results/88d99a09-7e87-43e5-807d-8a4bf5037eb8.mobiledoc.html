<p>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, TikTok. 48 hours until I'm back to work (even the self-employed are allowed holidays, you knowâ€¦), but that doens't stop me reading about this industry of ours. Here's some more interesting links to see you through the weekend.</p>

<h3 id="perugia-is-popular-for-proposals-">Perugia is popular for proposalsâ€¦</h3>
<p>This is an encouraging start to the year:</p>
<blockquote>Here are the numbers: a total of about 550 English-language proposals were received, of which 97 on 31 December (deadline day) alone, from Uruguay to Canada, from South Africa to Finland, from Australia to Nigeria and points in-between. This is, by a significant margin, the highest number of proposals we have ever received.</blockquote>
<p>I've never managed to get to Perugia for the festival. Maybe this year?</p>

<h3 id="youtube-in-radicalisation-discouragement-shocker">YouTube in radicalisation discouragement shocker</h3>
<p>Well, this goes against the conventional wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>Data scientist Mark Ledwich and UC Berkley researcher Anna Zaitsev have <a href="https://medium.com/@markoledwich/youtube-radicalization-an-authoritative-saucy-story-28f73953ed17">published</a> a study suggesting that YouTube "actively discourages" radicalism through its recommendation system. Their reviewers classified over 760 politics-oriented channels based on overall leaning, topics and proximity to the mainstream, and found that YouTube removed "almost all" suggestions for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/19/youtube-alex-jones-infowars-channel-new-zealand-attack/">conspiracy theorists</a>, white identitarians and "provocateurs" (read: purposefully offensive creators).</blockquote>

<h3 id="ecj-reinforces-existing-copyright-laws">ECJ reinforces existing copyright laws</h3>
<p>Pretty clearly in the "no shit, Sherlock" category - but this ECJ ruling supports the existing position that copyright remains with the photographer, even if they have published the image on Reddit or elsewhere. The idea that an image is free to use just because it's on the internet is pervasive enough that I encounter it in a few students every year. And it probably starts in schools - which is how this court case came to be. </p>
