          ", and everything in between. That's a lot for a normal year. However, it has been no normal year. The pandemic has pushed production of the 2021 model back and, as of right now, the first new Bronco is expected to roll off the line in May. Through all that has been going on this year, though, it would appear that Ford is going to deliver two-fold on its promise, with 300 available factory-developed or factory-authorized accessories for Bronco buyers to choose from."
