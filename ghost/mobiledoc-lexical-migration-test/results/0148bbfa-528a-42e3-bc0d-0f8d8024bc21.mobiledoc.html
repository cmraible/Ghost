<p>Mopar is a name that is very well known in the car community, RAM specifically has gained a reputation for being one of the greatest producers of high horsepower trucks in America. RAM has become infamous for such trucks as the RAM Dakota, Daytona, SRT-10, and most <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/9690/2021-Ram-TRX-Launch-Edition">recently the TRX.</a> This insane truck boasts the revered Dodge Hellcat engine pumping out 702 horsepower and 650 lb/ft of torque. <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/9690/2021-Ram-TRX-Launch-Edition">The TRX</a> is a step forward for the RAM automotive manufacturer, stuffing big horsepower numbers into muscle cars is a Mopar tradition as old as the company itself. However, putting those same numbers into a truck is absolutely ludicrous.</p>

<p>Luckily, if youâ€™re looking to get your hands on one of these beasts, there is currently an example of such a Mopar monster that is scheduled to be auctioned <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/9690/2021-Ram-TRX-Launch-Edition">on Motorsport Auction Group</a>. Upon launch, all of the trucks were sold out within hours, and this has led to an extremely inflated value. Due to the limited number of available <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/9690/2021-Ram-TRX-Launch-Edition">TRX models</a>, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain these insane muscle trucks. This supercharged demon accelerates from 0-60 mph in just 4.5 seconds and leaves the competitor trucks in the dust. This truck should probably command a high value at auction due to scarcity and anyone who wants one better hurry because it won't take long for someone to pick this truck up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/9690/2021-Ram-TRX-Launch-Edition">This brand-new truck</a> is so untouched that it still has the packaging plastic on the seats, the odometer only reads a mere 17 miles which is mostly shipping as it is practically impossible to move a truck without starting the engine at some point. Thanks to <a href="https://www.motorsportauctiongroup.com/article/9690/2021-Ram-TRX-Launch-Edition">Motorsport Auction Group</a> you could be the proud owner of this incredibly powerful beast rather than being forced to fantasize about having a truck that makes +700 horsepower. Better move fast before you miss your chance.</p>
