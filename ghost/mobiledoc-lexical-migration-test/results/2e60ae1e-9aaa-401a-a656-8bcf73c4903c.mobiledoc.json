What’s even worse is when an innocent bystander is killed, like what happened to the driver of a BMW in Orange County, California recently. A suspect in a Camaro was fleeing from Orange County Sheriff’s deputies at what we assume was a high rate of speed when he hit the BMW in an intersection."

However, the suspect driver blew through a red light, the two vehicles colliding. While the BMW driver perished after being rushed to the hospital, another person in that vehicle survived the crash although was in critical condition at the time of the report."

If someone doesn’t pull over but instead makes a run for it, whatever happens next is on them. Sadly, that doesn’t bring the driver of the BMW back, but we’ve never seen a case where running from the cops was the smart thing to do."
