<p>As the swan song for the C2 Corvette, GM decided to go extra clean for the design of the sports car. As you can clearly see, the Silver Pearl paint covers the simple body curves and is complemented by minimalistic amounts of chrome. A black vinyl auxiliary hardtop is included, which shines quite nicely, just like the rest of the car. Cast aluminum bolt-on wheels and redline Firestone tires round out the</p>
<p>The Black interior really pairs well with the exterior, plus it features little noticeable wear on the leather seats, carpeting, or anywhere else. What’s more, you get to enjoy the extra reassurance and comfort of headrests and shoulder belts. Factory air conditioning has already been updated to R134a. You also get to enjoy a telescopic steering wheel, speed warning indicator, and all the other factory controls.</p>
<p>As a proper American sports car, this C2 Corvette features the 327ci V8. That means 300-horsepower at your disposal. Don’t worry, a 2-speed PowerGlide automatic transmission means if you’re unsure about your three-pedal driving skills, this car is not too much to handle.</p>
<p>Quite a few people really love the 1967 Chevy Corvette because it shed a lot of what they believe was over-the-top styling included in other model years for the C2. A car like this will definitely get plenty of admiration, especially considering how clean it looks.</p>
