<p>What a diverse market the collector car industry represents. Every week, the Motorious editorial staff does a dive into the classified section of the site to find the cars for sale that we would want to buy for ourselves. These cars are more than worthy of a new garage, and we're thrilled to be able to share our picks with the readers each week. Here is a list of cars to check out as we roll into the first weekend of September.</p>

<p>With a heavy connection to Volkswagen along with its mid-engine configuration, the 914 is one of the most contentious Porsches ever made.
