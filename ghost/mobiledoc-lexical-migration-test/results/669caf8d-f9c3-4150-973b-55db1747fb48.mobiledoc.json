The company just looked at how often different vehicle-related hashtags were used. Some people might post a photo of a car and not use a hashtag. Others might use different variations of hashtags like #ChallengerSRT versus #DodgeChallenger. Quidco Discover did look at three hashtags per car, but that’s admittedly not an exhaustive search, so keep that in mind as you think of excuses why a Mustang finally beat your car."
