          "This R100 may look like nothing more than an old economy car from the ’70s but rest assured this car is the devil in disguise. Revving at over 11,000rpm this amazing little car is pushing out close to 240hp at only just 1,900lbs allowing this automobile to absolute flies. Born from the idea of a small under-powered economy car this thing has become a monster on the road. With that beautiful 13B pushing this car to its limits is there no one who can compete?"

If you even look up “R100” on google you’ll be directed to a very odd Japanese film and not the actual car. Hopefully, cars like this can shed some more light on this estranged branch of the automotive community. Rotaries are particularly fascinating as well, with not much actual benefit most people just like them for their sound. The owner of this shop says that he enjoys rotaries due to the unique nature of the engine and the different features that come with that."

When all is said and done this R100 is a fascinating JDM legend that can kick some real butt both on the track and the street."
