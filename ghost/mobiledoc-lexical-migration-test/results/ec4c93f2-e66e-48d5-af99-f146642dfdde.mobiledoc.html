<p>With interest in more modern performance cars growing, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/original-1987-chevrolet-camaro-iroc-z/">particularly those from the 80s</a>, it’s easy to feel like many rides which were once fun and affordable are now only <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/colorado-mansion-for/">playthings for the rich</a>. As we’ve pointed out, collecting cool cars doesn’t mean you have to be rich, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/collecting-cars-open-mind/">but you do have to think outside of the box</a>. In other words, if you’re chasing after that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1967-shelby-mustang/">1967 Shelby GT350</a> like everyone else, expect to pay a large fortune for one. However, you can get this very well-kept 1999 Dodge Durango Shelby SP-360 for a mere $24,995.</p>

<p>Wait, no, a Durango tuned by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby</a> isn’t cool – that’s what narrow-minded people would say. After all, you haven’t been told to like this modified <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1957-oldsmobile-super-88-fiesta-auction/">family hauler</a>, so until there’s some slick marketing behind it and the price jumps by $50,000 it will be mocked. Fortune favors the brave, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>You get the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-dodge-viper/">Viper look</a> on this SUV thanks to the sparkling GTS <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-dodge-viper/">Viper</a> Blue paint and dual white stripes. A sporty body kit and 18-inch chrome wheels help make this thing look even flashier. The cabin even features carbon-fiber trim, racing bucket seats, and Carroll Shelby’s signature on the dash. With well under 30,000 miles on the odometer, it’s no wonder this ride looks so clean.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t just a good-looking vehicle. Bolted up to the standard 5.9-liter V8 is a Kenne Bell twin-screw supercharger to cram more air into the cylinders. Also installed by Shelby is a revised ECU, performance intake, equal-length headers, plus a 2.5-inch diameter exhaust. All those mods combine for a peak output of 360-horsepower, which is about 90-hp above stock. Sure, you’re not going to roast many (or any) Corvettes, but you’ll blow away those pesky Tahoe and Explorer drivers with ease.</p>

<p>The owner of this Durango Shelby SP-360 decided to make things even hotter. There’s a custom camshaft upgrade which was installed during a full engine rebuild. Upgraded fuel injectors and a Hi-Volume 255 fuel pump help dump more gas in the cylinders. There’s a Holley Big Bore billet throttle body to pack in even more air. On the other end of things are Jet Hot Coat headers. Smoothing all that out is a full custom dyno tune. The dealer doesn’t indicate how much power it’s pushing now.</p>

<p>There’s more going on than just a power increase. As you might be aware, these old Durangos aren’t exactly known for tight, responsive handling. Upgrades to the suspension include new Eibach shocks, helping to change perceptions. Six-piston Stillen front brake calipers also provide far better stopping performance.</p>
