They portray an eclectic group of enthusiasts and cars, with just about every make and decade represented. Plenty of elaborate modifications abound, delighting the crowd. Friends and families gather to socialize while watching the vehicles cruise around the park. Children break open pinatas and people grill meat. Nothing in the videos seems to be genuinely disturbing."

Car enthusiasts need positive outlets for their hobby, just like everyone else. If you try to sweep the culture away, the result will likely be more problems, mounting frustrations, and a big mess."
