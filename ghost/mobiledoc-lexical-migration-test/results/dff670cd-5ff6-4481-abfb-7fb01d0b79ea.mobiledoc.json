Here, you’ll encounter your first campfires; each one represents a puzzle that needs to be completed. The entire environment is littered with bonfires and all you need to do is simply sit next to one to begin one of the many 200 puzzles. If you're successful, the campfire will continually burn and you will receive a wooden crate as a reward, which can then be used in the environment to access more areas as you slowly climb the mountain, giving you access to even more puzzles, etc. Each puzzle is devious in its design and will test even the most seasoned puzzle fan - I’m still slowly making my way through them... slowly."

Your character walks on a grid area while moving in four different directions to arrange boxes. Your main goal is simple: reach the large bonfire at the heart of each stage and burn all your stuff. It sounds easy enough but it's the process of getting there that will ultimately challenge and frustrate you. Luckily, there’s an undo button which will help if you’ve made a miss-step along the way."
