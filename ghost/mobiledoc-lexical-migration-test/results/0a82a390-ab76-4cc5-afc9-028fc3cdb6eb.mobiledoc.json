With the help of Trade and Industry Secretary Norman Tebbitt, Thatcher was able to negotiate a special deal for Nissan. Many letters and telegrams were exchanged in finalizing the deal, while exact details of the financial arrangements were kept low key to avoid potentially upsetting other businesses."

Thanks to recent industrial decline in the area – as well as its close proximity to the Tynes and Tees ports and Newcastle International Airport – a 799-acre site in Sunderland was chosen. Once the grounds of the RAF Usworth aerodrome, news of what the disused space would become created a rush of optimism amongst the local workforce. The factory couldn’t come any quicker."
