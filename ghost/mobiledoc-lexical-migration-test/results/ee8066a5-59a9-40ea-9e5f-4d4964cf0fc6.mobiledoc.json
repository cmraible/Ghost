Once the design is approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the F150 will contribute its ventilated seat blower for use in the Ford-made respirators. Likewise, the Bronco has a contribution as well. With a bit of collaboration from their supplier, Joysen Safety Systems, Ford will be producing gowns sharing the same material as Ford Bronco airbags."
