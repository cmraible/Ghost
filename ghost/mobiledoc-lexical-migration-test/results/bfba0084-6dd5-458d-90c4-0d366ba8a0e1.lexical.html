<p>Much ink has been spilled trying to understand what’s motivating Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Joe Manchin', D-W.Va., to try to gut so many of the popular progressive policies in Democrats’ health care, climate, and anti-poverty spending bill. Why would the senators be so content angering their base and potentially threatening their chances of winning reelection down the road?</p>
<p>During the fight over Democrats’ social spending reconciliation bill, Sinema, for example, has played a prominent — albeit silent — role in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/28/sinema-biden-prescription-drug-deal-517422">watering down the party’s plan</a> to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. She’s also <a href="https://www.axios.com/kyrsten-sinema-biden-budget-bill-32692586-cd10-4ea4-9cac-c41c2a29d33d.html">helped</a> gut Democrats’ plan to expand Medicare benefits, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/21/politics/manchin-sinema-town-hall/index.html">nixed tax hikes</a> on the wealthy and corporations, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/23/sinema-35t-spending-bill-506583">pushed</a> to make the overall bill smaller. While Sinema isn’t up for reelection until 2024, she is <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/elviadiaz/2021/10/21/sen-kyrsten-sinema-not-safe-primary-challenge-lose-poll-says/6124042001/">polling terribly</a> and already facing the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-left-is-done-pressuring-kyrsten-sinema-now-they-want-a-primary">threat</a> of a well-financed primary challenge.</p>
<p>While Manchin has a personal <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/03/joe-manchin-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/">financial interest</a> in protecting the fossil fuel industry, he’s also <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/573744-manchin-sends-warning-shot-on-plan-to-expand-medicare">worked</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-puts-paid-family-leave-medicare-vouchers-spending-bill-chopping-n1282328">diligently</a> to deny new Medicare dental benefits that seniors in his state <a href="https://www.wboy.com/news/west-virginia/study-ranks-west-virginia-2nd-worst-in-u-s-for-dental-health/">desperately need</a>. Manchin has been on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-16/manchin-rakes-in-cash-from-energy-industry-some-gop-donors">fundraising</a><a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/politics/manchin-campaign-contributions-skyrocketed-amid-debate-over-for-the-people-act/article_a36ebc52-ccd6-50b4-95cc-4e221c98a548.html">tear</a> this year, despite stating last week that he <a href="https://twitter.com/fran_chambers/status/1452992783971672073">hasn’t decided</a> whether he’ll run for reelection in 2024.</p>
<p>To understand what’s in it for conservative Democratic senators who play the party’s rotating villain role, look at those who came before them: Many of those who do big business’ bidding and then either fail to win reelection or retire quickly end up scoring lucrative careers on K Street. It’s the ultimate win-win situation.</p>
