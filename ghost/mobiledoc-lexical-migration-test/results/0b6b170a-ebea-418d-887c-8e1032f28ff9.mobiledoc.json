With Dodge killing the Hellcats, it would be very surprising for that to happen, so the Cuda will likely exist in the way we know it, pretty much the perfect muscle car."

Funny enough, the Challengers weren't regarded as muscle cars during their first years, but with the massive power figures they come with today, they check the box better than most anything on the market. It's a wonder why Dodge has officially put out the cancel call."

When options with a 396 cubic inch engine, the 1967 Camaro RS/SS checks the boxes, and deserves a spot on this list.

Another one in the pocket of the moniker is that it had one of the only, successful modern comebacks as a muscle car, since the Challenger didn't actually start out that way.
