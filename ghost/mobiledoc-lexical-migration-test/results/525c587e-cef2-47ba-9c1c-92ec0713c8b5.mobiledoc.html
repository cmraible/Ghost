<p>When it comes to air cooled Porsche 911s, the <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1988-porsche-911-carrera-106/">late Carrera G50</a> cars built between 1987 and 1989 are among the most desirable. What makes them so desirable? It's the combination of the classic body – and classic character – of the air cooled 911, combined with just the right number of modern touches that make them wonderful to drive and own.</p>

<p>All 1984-1989 3.2 Carreras feature the excellent Bosch Motronic fuel injection system. It's complex enough to allow the car to perform well in all weather conditions, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1988-porsche-911-carrera-106/">while remaining</a> simple enough for an average DIYer to maintain and diagnose.</p>

<p>What sets the 1987 to 1989 <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1988-porsche-911-carrera-106/">Carreras apart</a>, though, is the Borg-Warner G50 gearbox. The G50 featured a hydraulic clutch and was a smoother shifting gearbox than the rugged but finicky Type 915 transmission it replaced.</p>
