<hr>
<p>Before Mopar was leaving the competition in the dust with its modern muscle cars, there was the original muscle car era and the king of the track was the <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">1969-½ 'lift-off' hood Super Bee.</a>Everyone wanted one but only 153 people actually got a 1969-½ year model with the A-12 performance package. This limited of a production run poses an even bigger issue for those that are still pining over the legendary Super Bee as there are likely even less to go around. Don’t give up on that dream just yet though because <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">Dream Giveaway is offering</a> you the chance to enter to win this fully restored example with only 27,000 original miles on the clock.</p>

<p>Starting out with an already prime example, a national <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/superbee?promo=MOTORIOUS18">Super Bee</a> expert took this car to a whole new level. Featuring all of its original A19 Package parts and a low mileage, the car was then fully restored to original spec. A fiberglass lift-off hood, a 390-horsepower 440 Six-Pack engine and a Dana 60 rear axle with 4.10 rear gears, all in perfect working order and show quality condition. What could be better? How about a no-nonsense interior, a Police handling package, and a set of 15x6 Black H.D. wheels wrapped in reproduction G70x15 Redline tires just as it was intended.</p>
