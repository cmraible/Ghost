The two teenagers left Foster’s home in White County, Tennessee in Bechtel’s 1988 Pontiac Grand Am and were never seen again. Understandably, both families were tortured by not knowing what happened, but the mystery has finally been solved, at least in part, and it’s all thanks to YouTube channel Exploring With Nug."

Some of the junk is just that, other items are identified as lost and are returned to their owner. And then there are those rare occasions when poking around in waterways leads to solving a missing persons case that’s 21 years old."

          "Funny enough, this story started at church. White County Sheriff Steve Page said that back on November 11 he was at church when a relative of Erin Foster asked if he’d ever seen Exploring With Nug on YouTube. Page had never even heard of the channel, but he asked for a link, which he checked out when he got home. Immediately, the sheriff realized the YouTuber, who was actively searching for Foster and Bechtel, could be of help. There was just one problem: Page felt Sides was looking in the wrong area."

Divers have been combing the river in case the bodies turn out to belong to others. Oddly, the same area of the river had been searched before, but Page believes they didn’t dive in that exact spot."
