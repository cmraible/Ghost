All three companies ceased operations in 1937, but the Auburn  Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum was opened on July 6, 1974 in Auburn,  Indiana to preserve the original buildings as well as the heritage of  these high-end automakers. Just 45 years later, this museum has grown to  be the largest museum of its kind housing 140 vintage and antique  vehicles and attracting attracting over 40,000 visitors a year."
