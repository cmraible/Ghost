Group messaging is here:\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XNnVH-mwSdM\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n\n## 30 seconds of Twitter video\n\nPossibly more interesting from a journalistic point of view is the fact that they’re adding video natively into Twitter apps:\n\n> Our unique mobile video camera and inline editing experience lets you capture and share videos up to 30 seconds in an instant. Twitter for iPhone users will be able to upload videos from the camera roll as well (a feature that will be available on our Android app soon). [Here’s more information](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/about.twitter.com/videos-on-twitter) on the new mobile video camera.\n\nThese features are being rolled out to users [over the next few days](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/now-on-twitter-group-direct-messages-and-mobile-video-capture). Video should get a lot of traction fast – as photos did when they were added. Group messaging? There’s a lot of competition out there. Let’s see if Twitter can make its offering compelling, without having to make it a separate app.\n\n\n"
