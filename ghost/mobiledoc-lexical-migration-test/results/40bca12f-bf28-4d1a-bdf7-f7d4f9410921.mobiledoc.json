And these days that’s pretty much anything."

The only catch is you have to own an Apple device to track it and if thieves have an iPhone, they can be alerted to its presence. However, there are tutorials on how to remove the speaker from AirTags so you can make it more difficult for thieves to detect where you’ve hidden it in the car."

Just like in many other cities, kids are now swiping those cars at alarming rates with indications the trend is only growing. It’s gotten so bad that some insurance companies won’t cover certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles in various areas since the likelihood of a theft claim is incredibly high."
