<p>While the Democratic establishment ballyhoos President Joe Biden’s bipartisan victory in getting the Senate to move forward on a truncated infrastructure package, they’re ignoring the fact that the party is barreling head first towards a far more ominous defeat. The most important political deadline of the decade is coming up in just a few weeks, and a key source in the House has told <em>The Daily Poster</em> that the Democrats are all but assured to drop the ball on it, dooming their electoral prospects for years to come.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>A source in the House has confirmed that Democrats are likely going to let pass the most important political deadline of the decade — and the consequences promise to be dire.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> recently <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-decades-biggest-political-deadline/">reported</a> that Democrats have until August 16, or shortly thereafter, to pass redistricting reform. That’s the date when the U.S. Census Bureau will release census data to the states, enabling them to begin the once-a-decade process of redrawing their state legislative and congressional districts.</p>
<p><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Partisan_composition_of_state_legislatures">Most</a> of the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/who-draws-maps-legislative-and-congressional-redistricting">31 states</a> in which state legislatures draw those districts are Republican-controlled. If no reform is passed, the GOP is planning to use the process to disempower Democratic voters for ten years.</p>
<p>Democrats made election reform their first priority in Congress this year with an ambitious piece of legislation known as the For The People Act, alternatively known as H.R.1 and S.1, which contains redistricting reforms. But as the pivotal August 16 deadline approaches, Biden and party leadership appear to have given up on the issue completely.</p>
<p>“We just passed an independent redistricting commission [in H.R.1] to ensure that Republicans don’t draw the lines and secure a majority with a minority of the national vote,” the House source told <em>The Daily Poster</em>. “It would be political malpractice for Democrats not to do this when we have the majority.”</p>
<p>And yet, that’s exactly what appears to be happening, the source explained: “Unfortunately redistricting reform is unlikely to happen, given the president’s unwillingness to push for doing away with the filibuster for democracy reform.”</p>
<p>Weeks after a Republican filibuster prevented debate on the For The People Act, Biden gave a speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia in which he declined to back filibuster reform — which is currently held up by two Democratic senators — and encouraged his audience to think of alternative means to combat voter suppression.</p>
<p>“Legislation is one tool,” Biden <a href="https://jeetheer.substack.com/p/biden-turns-his-back-on-voting-rights?r=bh54&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=twitter">said</a>, “but not the only tool.”</p>
<p>The last time districts were redrawn, the GOP planned ahead and invested heavily in state races to solidify control of state legislatures. They then weaponized the map-drawing process, crafting districts that heavily favored the GOP. The result? Republican majorities that were able to withstand Democatic wave elections. The GOP held the House until 2018, dooming the Obama administration’s agenda. Republicans have held a majority of state governments ever since.</p>
<p>Thanks to better map-drawing technologies and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-decades-biggest-political-deadline/">recent Supreme Court decisions</a> that cleared the way for continued partisan redistricting, experts say the current round of gerrymandering is likely to be far more extreme.</p>
<p>Last week, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, <a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1405912329129185284?lang=en">admitted to a conference of religious conservatives</a> that the GOP plan is to gerrymander control of the House.</p>
<p>“We have redistricting coming up and the Republicans control most of that process in most of the states around the country,” Jackson said. “That alone should get us the majority back.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congress is set to go on recess soon for most of August.</p>

<p>Just over 12 years ago, on July 20, 2009, the federal minimum wage increased to $7.25. That same week, President Barack Obama was six months into his first term, “I Gotta Feeling” by the Black Eyed Peas <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2009-07-25">topped the Billboard Hot 100</a> chart, the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417741/">sixth Harry Potter movie</a> had just been released, and Instagram didn’t exist yet.</p>
<p>Today, the federal minimum wage is still $7.25.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OIL COMPANY PAYS JUSTICES, GETS FAVORABLE RULING: </strong>Texas oil giant Apache Corp. appears <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/After-250k-in-political-support-from-Apache-16336149.php">to have paid for justice</a> — or rather, injustice. In 2013, a paralegal sued company in Texas for age and gender discrimination. A jury sided with the plaintiff, awarding her and her team $900,000. An appeals court upheld the decision, and the Texas Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Litigants are permitted to ask the state’s justices to reconsider such decisions, but the court rarely does so. In this case, Apache Corp. filed such a request, but only after donating $250,000 to the reelection of two of the court’s incumbent justices. This week, the court sided with Apache, agreeing to consider their appeal.</li>
    <li><strong>EVICTION MORATORIUM SET TO EXPIRE:</strong> In late June, the Supreme Court upheld the CDC’s eviction moratorium, but barred the body from extending it beyond July 31 without congressional authorization. Now, in the eleventh hour — just days before that deadline, with COVID-19 cases on the rise — the White House has made a symbolic gesture <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1420757237056917504?s=20">calling on Congress</a> to act.</li>
    <li><strong>BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL RELEASED: </strong>The Senate voted on Wednesday to move forward on debating a bipartisan infrastructure bill, hours after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., announced that she does not support the current framework for the more extensive, companion infrastructure plan put forward by Democrats, meaning the latter would not have enough support to pass through the budget reconciliation process. David Dayen of <em>The American Prospect</em> has a <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/building-back-america/infrastructure-summer-one-deal-forward-one-deal-back/">good rundown</a> of what made it into the bipartisan deal and what was <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamAton/status/1420757756030570502?s=20">left out</a> of both bills.</li>
    <li><strong>MORE CORPORATE TAX AVOIDANCE UNCOVERED: </strong>In the three-year period since Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut, 39 profitable companies did not pay any federal income taxes, according to <a href="https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-under-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/">a new report</a> from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Between 2018 and 2020, those 39 companies, which included FedEx, T-Mobile, and Salesforce, reported a combined $122 billion in profits.</li>
    <li><strong>WHITE HOUSE AIDE BOOSTING SHONTEL BROWN: </strong>White House senior advisor Cedric Richmond’s congressional campaign committee <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202104159443612287">contributed $2,000</a> in February to Nina Turner’s primary opponent, Shontel Brown. On June 15, Richmond’s campaign <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202107159451374011">donated</a> $25,000 to Protecting Our Vote PAC, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-business-is-coming-out-against-nina-turner/">lobbyist-led</a> super PAC supporting Brown, whose campaign against progressive icon Turner has strong support from corporate interests and the Democratic Party establishment.</li>
