The all-fiberglass body does an excellent job of mimicking the 356's iconic lines and incorporating them onto the modern Boxster. The exterior color is called Melting Silver and this car wears a custom-made set of 19-inch split-rim alloy wheels, and it would seem that the only carryover body parts are the windshield and the hard tonneau cover, which makes sense since this car retains the Boxster's factory power-retractable soft top. Inside, the saddle-colored leather interior far more similar to the factory Boxster with the exception of the custom bucket seats."

So far, this is the only Iconic Autobody 387 Speedster that has been made, and it used a 2.7-liter Boxster with 69,000 miles as a donor vehicle. Based on this review, none of the Boxster's spunkiness was lost in translation. This particular car is being sold for £69,995 (around $89,000 USD) out the door, but Total Headturners will transform your supplied Boxster into an Iconic Autobody 387 Speedster for £65,000 (about $80,000 USD not including the donor vehicle)."
