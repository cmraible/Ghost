<p>We see all kinds of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/look-on-in-horror-at-these-12-valuable-barn-find-cars/">barn find cars</a> on a regular basis, but lately we’ve been enjoying these restoration videos for diecast vehicles. We already covered how Dominic Toretto’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/10-things-charger/">Dodge Charger</a> was restored on the YouTube channel Good Restore, so we figured it was worthwhile to show how Brian O’Conner’s Toyota Supra from the first <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-chevelle-fast-furious/">Fast and Furious</a></em> movie was restored.</p>
<p>Like the Charger, this Paul Walker car looks pretty sad. Instead of that vibrant orange paint there’s a lot of corrosion with only hints of orange here and there. The windshield looks like it melted in the sun, plus the tires, headlights, and interior are all extremely rough. Most people would just toss this toy, but this guy sees a value in it.</p>
<p>One big plus for this car is the 2JZ inline-six is still gleaming under the ratty, unsecured hood. We can only wonder if they make the toy version just as durable as the real thing, because that’s impressive.</p>
<p>Just like with the Charger, this guy methodically disassembles and cleans every nook and cranny of this Supra. Then he strips off what’s left of the old paint, sands down the body, sprays on some primer, and applies a nice even coat of that shocking orange.</p>
<p>The level of attention to detail is excellent this time around, like how the guy paints the NOS bottles in two steps and even applies fresh labels to both. He also applies decals for the gauge cluster and paints some of the tiny controls. There are many more details added and we’re wondering if this toy car doesn’t look better than it did when new. He even got the body graphics done, including all the sponsor stickers on the rocker panel.</p>
<p>It’s pretty funny how the video starts off with the scene where <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/paul-walkers-nissan-skyline-r34/">Paul Walker</a> proudly declares the Toyota Supra on the back of a tow truck is Vin Diesel’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">10-second car</a>. The movie car doesn’t look too far off from the diecast toy before it too goes through a dramatic restoration. Check out the video for yourself.</p>
