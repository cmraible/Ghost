            "text": "The Ford Mustang is one of America's favorite muscle cars because of its extremely high production numbers, low cost, and high focus on performance and driving fun. Without a doubt, Ford has been knocking it out of the park with the Mustang since 1964, which has led many enthusiasts within the community to take notice. Just like any pony car in the American performance line-up, this car has been used in motorsport in everything from drag racing to autocross. While it's easy to focus on the Mustang's distinct desire to outperform the competition in the handling sector, the drag racing side of things is surprisingly popular for this vehicle.",

All of that intense power is sent directly through a six-speed manual transmission that utilizes an H-pattern to send this beautiful red rocket flying. This is highly noticeable on the quarter-mile, where it ran a 6.81 at 208 mph. Such an incredible time is usually challenging to capture in a manual transmission vehicle, but this guy managed to pull it off with ease.",

The fantastic thing about this race is that this man was competing directly with the previous record holder in the lane next to him. Despite this, the driver is still trying to beat his record as he hopes to hit 6.5 seconds by the end of the weekend. Unfortunately, the car began experiencing technical difficulties and could not continue racing. Still, it is safe to say that this is one of the fastest stick shift cars to ever hit the track with an even better driver behind the wheel.",
