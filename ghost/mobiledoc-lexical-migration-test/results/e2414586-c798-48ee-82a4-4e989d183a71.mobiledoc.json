          "The 580-horsepower 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine found in the 2012 Camaro ZL1 has now evolved into a monstrous machine based on the LT4 that produces 650-horsepower and an equal amount of torque. While this number marks the highest horsepower rating for the Camaro, it pales in comparison to the power ratings of its competition. The Mustang GT500 for example, has the ZL1 beat by a hundred horsepower and Dodges supercharged HEMI powered muscle cars have Ford beat by an additional hundred horsepower."

          "Some enthusiasts will argue that horsepower ratings are just numbers and that performance is better judged by how the car performs on the track, and as it turns out, the Camaro ZL1 debates this point very well with its 3.5 second sprint to 60-mph and low 11 second quarter mile capabilities. The race, however, is not just about straight-line performance for this Chevy. The ZL1’s 10-speed automatic transmission and unmatched aerodynamics lends the Camaro a hand on the road course. Furthermore, there are many other, non-performance based aspects about the car that set it apart from the competition, including some of Chevrolet’s best driver comfort and entertainment features."
