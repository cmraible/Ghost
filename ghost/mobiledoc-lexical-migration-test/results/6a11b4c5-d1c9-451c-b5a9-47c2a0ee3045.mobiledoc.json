What that means in the long term, though, we don‚Äôt know. I find it hard to believe that the vehement opposition that Linehan has provoked will be happy to let him Substack away merrily undisturbed. Interestingly, Best makes it clear that they haven‚Äôt ‚Äî yet ‚Äî had any serious attempts to silence any of their writers."

It will be more agile, and harder to keep track of than traditional media. The more successful it becomes, the more the early adopter crowd will be supplanted by the more extreme voices. And subscribing to a newsletter about views outside the accepted norm is a lot less public than following such people on social media."
