<p>If you grew up in the '80s, then there's no doubt that you had a picture of the Ferrari 328 hanging on your wall. Of the 7,412 Ferrari 328s that were built between 1986 and 1989, a total of 6,068 were the GTS models with its targa top design, and this <a href="https://www.ironplanet.com/for-sale/Automobiles-1986-Ferrari-328-GTS-Spyder-Arizona/4008262?h=5002%2Cmsg%7C53701%2CisAuc%7Cyes&rr=0.08333&hitprm=&pnLink=yes?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1986 Ferrari 328 GTS</a> is a wonderful example of this car surviving in original condition with low miles.</p>

<p>An '80s Ferrari doesn't get more iconic than this 1986 Ferrari 328 GTS with its bright red paint job, five-spoke wheels and tan leather interior. In contrast to the hardtop 328 GTB, the GTS allows for open-air driving with a removable roof panel, but this is only half of what makes the 328 GTS so much fun to drive.</p>
<p>As defined by its name, the 328 is powered by a 3.2-liter V8, and this fuel-injected engine delivers 270 horsepower. This engine is paired to a gated five-speed manual transmission that will leave any driving enthusiast giddy, but the true joy of driving a mid-engine Ferrari is having that V8 singing its high-revving symphony so close to the driver's ears.</p>
<p>This Ferrari has definitely been enjoyed in its lifetime with just over 31,000 original miles, and it has also been well cared for as evident by the current condition as well as the recommended 30,000-mile service having been performed recently. All of this car's service records and the original owner's manual are included in the sale.</p>
