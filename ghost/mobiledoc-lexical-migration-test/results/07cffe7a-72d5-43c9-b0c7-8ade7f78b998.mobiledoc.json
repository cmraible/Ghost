These challenges can involve clearing the level within a certain timeframe, not missing a single shot or going through the whole level without slowing down time. Whilst this creates an optional level of challenge, the timer doesn't slow down when you slow down time, shooting objects can help gain better vantage points (and is arguably part of the puzzle) and time altering is the game's primary mechanic. With this in mind, you'll only get one star for completing a level and therefore, the challenges felt like the game was diminishing its own experience or rather, shooting itself in the foot (pun intended)."
