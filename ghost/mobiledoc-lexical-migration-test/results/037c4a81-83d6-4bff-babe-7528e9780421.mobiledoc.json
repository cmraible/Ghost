Those who had a real need for speed of course went with the latter of the two engines. It’s possible this car has undergone an engine swap, but if not we’re going to go out on a limb here and say it has the Hemi. Whatever it’s running, the muscle car absolutely demolishes the Camaro it’s up against."
