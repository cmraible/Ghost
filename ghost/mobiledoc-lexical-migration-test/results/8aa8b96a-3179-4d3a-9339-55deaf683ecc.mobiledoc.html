So, off we went.</p>
<p>I used to like Bluewater. I used to think it was a cut above other British shopping centres (which it still is), but then two things happened. First of all, it became more of a hang-out for chavs (for want of a better phrase), with the <a href="http://www.showcasecinemas.co.uk/pages/bluewater.phtml">cinema</a> in particular suffering badly from this. And second, I visited a real American mall, the <a href="http://www.galleriamall-fl.com/">Galleria</a> in Fort Lauderdale, and now I know I see Bluewater for the pale imitation it is.</p>
<p>Still, it has an <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/bluewater">Apple Store</a>, so the day wasnâ€™t entirely wasted.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
