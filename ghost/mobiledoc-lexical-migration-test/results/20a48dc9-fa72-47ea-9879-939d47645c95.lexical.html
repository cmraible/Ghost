<hr>
<p>The "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/no-stone-left-unturned-1972-chevy-k5-blazer/">Action Line</a>" pickups, sold between 1967 and 1972, are among the most beloved classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lingenfelter-tuned-c8-corvette/">Chevrolet</a> and GMC <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/retired-work-truck-1950-chevy-3100/">trucks</a> ever built. Take one look at the first-year stepside model seen here, and you'll understand why.</p>

<p>They're handsome-looking trucks, with a clean and simple design that's timeless and attractive to just about anyone who likes trucks. We'd be lying if we said it wasn't one of our favorite pickup designs ever.</p>
<p>We found <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/212838/1967-chevrolet-c10">this 1967 Chevrolet C10</a> right on Motorious, offered by Classic Car Liquidators of Sherman, Texas for just under $30,000. So, what does $30,000 get you in a classic C10? Let's take a look.</p>

<p>On the outside, this freshly restored pickup has it all: great paint, shiny chrome, and fresh trim. The narrow stepside bed has wood planks with stainless steel strips that make it almost too nice to use for any serious hauling.</p>
<p>We also like the Rally wheels wrapped with BFGoodrich white letter tires. This is definitely more of a street truck than an off-roader. Compared to other trucks of its era, it should handle and stop reasonably well, too, thanks to its power steering, power front disc brakes, and upgraded front sway bar.</p>

<p>If you look closely, you'll notice a badge on the front fender that looks like it could have come off of a Corvette or a muscle car of the period. It hints at the big surprise under the hood â€“a 427 cubic inch big block V8.</p>
<p>According to the add, the big block breathes through an Edelbrock carburetor perched atop an Edelbrock aluminum intake manifold. Spent gases are sent through a dual exhaust. There's plenty of chrome detailing under the hood, but we're sure that this truck would attract a lot of attention regardless at a car show.</p>
