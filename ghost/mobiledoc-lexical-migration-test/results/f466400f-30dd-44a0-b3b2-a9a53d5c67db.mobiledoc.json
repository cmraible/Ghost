          "After 16 years of sitting, this masterpiece has finally been dug up to make its display to the world once again. This monster once roamed the streets of California sporting a few menacing qualities such as the N96 shaker hood, Rally wood-grain dash, G36 painted racing mirrors and 15x7 Rally wheels. Unfortunately, the car doesn't come with the original engine or transmission. However, it isn't all that bad because the power plant under the hood of this fantastic pony car is a ludicrous 1968 440 cubic inch engine mated to a 727 custom-built transmission. This crazy train of an automobile makes up for the lack of original parts with incredible power and insane driving experience."

Though the engine and transmission have both been replaced, this car is commanding a price tag of $64,000. The red and black icon currently sits in Livonia, Michigan, ripe for the picking. This piece of American muscle car history has the potential to be resurrected to its former beauty as a racing legend and be back on the streets in no time."
