<p>The Bronco was professionally restored and built by Heavy Metal Customs and features a new 302-CID crate engine mated to a Jasper automatic transmission with an NP 208 transfer case. The monster truck stance is more than just a look. It is the real deal undoubtedly capable of extreme off-roading. Putting power to the ground is a pair of Dana 44 differentials with Detroit lockers. The 9-inch rear end features 4.56:1 gears and Positraction. Yukon off-road axles and springs and 10-inch International Springs rear coil springs were used alongside six Skyjacker HD shocks and a Borgeson steering shaft.</p>

<p>Among the custom parts on this Bronco are ladder bars with locks, roll bar, bumpers, and a shiny red paint job. The interior is also custom made with marine grade, waterproof materials. Even the professional grade sound system is waterproof. The monstrous 39-inch tall tires wrap around a new set of wheels which encase four-wheel disc brakes. LED lighting accents the wheel wells. While the ad makes no claims as to original mileage, it does state that there are only 42,000 miles on the odometer.</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-bronco-comparison/">With the 2021 Bronco</a> expected to be delivered in the upcoming spring or maybe even as late as this summer, it's nice to see an original in such good condition and set up in an optimal way to handle the terrain that the Bronco was intended for. Given the choice between the two year models, most enthusiasts would probably have trouble deciding which keys to reach for. That is if owning both was off the table.</p>
