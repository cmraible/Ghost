Under the hood, is a 600-horsepower, 6.1-liter Hemi V8 with a custom 3x3 electronic fuel injection system making it a modern version of a six-pack Hemi, and this engine is matched with a six-speed manual transmission. The exterior has been modified with hidden headlights that get a modern touch with LED halo rings, while the raised rear wing and Snakeskin Green paint job (from the Dodge Viper) will certainly make this car an instant hit at car shows."

Plymouth never built a version of GTX in its final year, but this Curious Yellow GTX drop top will have Mopar fanatics doing a double take. The car itself underwent a nut-and-bolt rotisserie restoration, and the convertible conversion features an OE stock replaceable vinyl top."
