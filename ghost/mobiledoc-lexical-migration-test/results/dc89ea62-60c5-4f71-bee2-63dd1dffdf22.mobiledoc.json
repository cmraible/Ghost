Instead, this was like watching Joe Biden trying to drive his Corvette today – a completely terrifying ordeal."

Sure, it seems to be a glancing strike, but you can hear what almost sounds like the crunching and scraping of metal on metal. Plus, the collision was enough to jostle the back end of the rather heavy electric car. Anyone driving should notice such a thing immediately, not reverse and do it again."

Maybe he is, but in that moment he didn’t demonstrate that. And that really makes me stop and think."
