<hr>
<p>Over the years, a lot of incredibly high value cars have been discovered sitting in garages across the country. From muscle cars to vintage 30s cruisers, you might think you've seen it all. However, there is one particular seven-figure barn find that has been sitting for a pretty long time. Without a doubt, it’s one of the rarest vintage vehicle collections we have seen quite a long time. All of this is great but there’s one cart that really stands out from the others here.</p>
<p><strong>See Jay Leno showing off a very expensive Duesenberg <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/most-expensive-duesenberg-ever/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Secluded for 55 years, this vehicle was once the height of classic luxury automobiles and even more the name of one of the worlds most iconic and unique manufactures. That name is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/the-last-j-duesenberg/">Duesenberg</a>, you might remember the brand from their various exploits in the name of automotive innovation. This particular one is a model J, a vehicle which is already incredibly rare on the classic automotive market. Having been made in 1931, you can see that it would be pretty hard to find a good example nowadays.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s subject to the same wear and tear that any vehicle might have from being almost 90 years old. It may be aged but the fact that only 25 examples were made is probably a bigger reason for the car to be ready. Surrounding it, you’ll find a few other cool classic cars from around that time. It may be unique but it certainly found its home among cars just as eye-catching and valuable. Recently it’s finally been re-unveiled to the world and hopefully these cars will be getting a bath pretty soon but until then it’s awesome to see these old legends still being taken care of today.</p>
