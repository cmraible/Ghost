During the 1970s and 1980s, the cars could be ordered as a kit car which were basically a complete car minus the drive train. This allowed buyers to fit their own engine, transaxle, and suspension system in the car or purchase them separately from Puma which proved to be more economical for buyers trying to import the cars into the US. In all very few cars made it into the US and in 1995 Puma sold its last sports car, an AM4."

This red AM4 features a rear mounted 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, a 4-speed manual transmission, and a fully independent suspension. A two-tone tan and black bucket seat interior with a full length console appears to be well taken care of and the black convertible top seems to be in good condition. Puma didnâ€™t make very many of these cars and even fewer were imported so this very well could be a once in a lifetime chance to add this little red sports car to your collection."
