<hr>
<p>Starting with Ford’s 3.6-liter V8 engine, Shelby soon discovered just how versatile <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3852007-1965-Backdraft-Racing-Shelby-Cobra">the AC Cobra</a> platform could be. With a Jaguar E-Type rear end, literally any of Ford’s engine and transmission options could be adapted and displacement was soon bumped up to 4.3-liters. Over the next few years Shelby continued his search for the right engine. After experimenting with 390-cid big blocks, the 427-cid engine was finally settled on and Shelby ended up producing a total of 348 examples over a two-year period. Although the Shelby Cobra seemed to have been perfected Shelby did not stop trying to make the car better. However, the popularity of the design was in many ways bigger than the man that had created it and many others have produced their own versions over the years. One such company is <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3852007-1965-Backdraft-Racing-Shelby-Cobra">Backdraft Racing</a>. </p>
