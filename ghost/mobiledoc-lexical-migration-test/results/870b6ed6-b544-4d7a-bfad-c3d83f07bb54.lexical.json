And bored, while waiting. So, phone pic time. It’s a dull, corporate looking hospital from the outside, but inside it’s the most impressive hospital I’ve been in. Friendly, spacious, efficient and, based on Mum’s treatment, I’m very impressed.\n\nHeritage buildings and hospitals are not good partners, in my book. New build all the way.\n\n\n"
