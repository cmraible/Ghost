          "The Sting Ray is a legend on wheels. The C2 was designed by Larry Shinoda (Pete Brock was also instrumental on the C2) under the direction of GM chief stylist Bill Mitchell. They used crisp lines to accent everything from the big fenders, to the rear deck. The upgraded red paint has the right kind of gloss and shine that makes the sunshine-friendly droptop look terrific when you’re out cruising on a Sunday. Plus, on the days when you feel like having the top up, the black roof gives this a timeless color combo."

It has a great classic look on everything from the low-back bucket seats to the vertical Delco AM/FM radio that’s still cranking out tunes."

While the ’64 cars only had 327 cubic-inch V8s, this one has been upgraded to a 350 unit. Plus, it has other nice upgrades like a Holley four-barrel carburetor and MSD ignition. The motor fires up nicely and runs strong."
