Under the hood is an Omori Factory RB26DETT Nismo Fine Spec Final Edition Motor, which is #140 of only 200 made. That means a number of internal upgrades versus the stock engine in other R32s, including everything having been hand built by Nismo technicians. The 2.6-liter twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine pushes out plenty of power for this car to really scoot. Updated R35 GT-R coil packs, MAF, and injectors were installed. There’s a full FGK Titanium exhaust and two SARD intakes. A five-speed manual transmission, all-wheel drive, Ohlins Road and Track coilovers, and OEM V-Spect II Brembo brakes provide all the control you need."

There’s a carbon fiber front lip, reverse side skirts, Hasemi sport trunk lip, reverse rear bumper lip, and Volk TE37 SL wheels for a sleek exterior presentation. What you can’t see is the full chassis has been refreshed, too."

Also really dressing up the space is a custom dash protector, which bears the Nismo logo and has been fashioned to look similar to carbon fiber. Conversion to modern R134A AC helps with comfort during the heat of the summer.  A Nismo shifter knob and Momo Nismo carbon-fiber steering wheel with red stitching  tops everything off."
