That’s what makes watching this woodworker craft a 1967 Shelby GT500, one of the most iconic classic muscle cars, so fascinating. It’s obviously a sped-up version of the work, but it sure gives you a taste of what creating a little car out of wood involves."

The tires have tread blocks and voids. He even fashions a two-piece gas door and cap. Most people would make something that kind of resembles a Shelby GT500 and call it good, but this guy goes the extra mile and then some."

He’s also using a nice array of tools you might not have, so if you really want to attempt it you’ll need to give yourself plenty of time and really study this video closely. Even then, don’t expect your car to look as good."
