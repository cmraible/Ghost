<p>The clichÃ© of a roadcrash interview is over-used. But Ashley Feinberg of <em>HuffPost US</em>'s <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jack-dorsey-twitter-interview_us_5c3e2601e4b01c93e00e2a00">interview with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey</a> is a genuine example of the genre. So many of his responses are either utterly incoherent or just plan jaw-dropping, that I could choose any of them as an illustrative quote. But let's go for this one:</p>
<blockquote><strong>OK, but if Trump tweeted out asking each of his followers to murder one journalist, would you remove him?</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>That would be a violent threat. Weâ€™d definitely ... You know weâ€™re in constant communication with all governments around the world. So weâ€™d certainly talk about it.</blockquote>
<p>"talk about it". ðŸ¤¯</p>
<p>I've been skeptical about Dorsey since I read Nick Bilton's compelling book <a href="https://amzn.to/2CpclqA"><em>Hatching Twitter</em></a><em>, </em>but this does much to confirm that much of Twitter's muddled response to some serious issues with the platform is coming from the top. </p>
