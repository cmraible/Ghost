<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Some exciting news — thanks to subscriber support, we are now very close to hiring on more reporters to this journalism project. So I’m emailing you with a request:</p>
<p><strong>Can you please <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sirota">click here</a> and pitch in to become a supporting subscriber? The address is <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve been reading the free version of this newsletter, you know we’ve been covering crucial stories that are often ignored by the corporate-owned media — from the story of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity">nursing home deaths</a>, to the story of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sec-blows-the-whistle-on-its-trump">billionaires raiding retirees’ savings</a>, to the story of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gilead-is-profiteering-off-a-covid">pandemic profiteering by pharmaceutical companies</a>. And we’ve recently gotten some terrific recognition for this journalism from the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-06-19/private-equity-401k-plans">Los Angeles Times</a> and the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-pennsylvania-gop-scandal-hidden-data-pandemic/">American Prospect</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to folks pitching in as paying subscribers, we were able to bring aboard investigative reporter Andrew Perez, who has been breaking <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trumps-covid-directive-may-force">big stories for us</a>. Now, we are close to bringing on another great reporter and we are also aiming to engage some freelance journalists.</p>
<p><strong>But to do that, we need as many free subscribers to go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> to become monthly or annual supporting subscribers.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again — billionaire- and corporate-owned media will never consistently scrutinize or question the power of the billionaires and corporations who are taking over our democracy. That’s why we are building TMI — a GRASSROOTS-FUNDED journalism project that answers only to readers. Our work is getting wider distribution in Jacobin and The Guardian — and with more <a href="#/portal/signup">supporting subscribers</a>, we will have more reporting resources to continue to expand what we are doing.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
