<p>Ah, Media Twitter is all aflutter with this news from the <em>New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Gateway Pundit, a provocative conservative blog, gained notice last year for its fervent pro-Trump coverage and its penchant for promoting false rumors about voter fraud and Hillary Clinton’s health that rocketed around right-wing websites.</p>
    <p>Now the site will report on politics from a prominent perch: the White House.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they certainly seem pleased about it:</p>

<p>Heavens-to-Betsy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/business/the-gateway-pundit-trump.html">a <em>blogger</em> in the press room</a>? There will be a predictable backlash from journalists (in fact there probably already is one), who will do some eye-rolling at the infiltration of the <em>true</em> journalists’ space. And they will all have forgotten this:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Bloggers and pundits have been granted access to White House briefings in previous administrations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of the word “blog” here is pretty arbitrary. The definition of “blog” and “website” are pretty hazy at the best of times and the past five years have only blurred that. (Remember when people were calling Buzzfeed and Huffington Post blogs?)</p>
<p><em>Gateway Pudit</em> itself has <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/02/carlos-slims-anti-trump-blog-new-york-times-attacks-tgp/">a little fun with that distinction</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The New York Times, a provocative liberal blog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concern here isn’t that the White House has granted press credentials to a Pro-Trump <em><strong>Blog</strong></em>, but that it has granted them to a <em><strong>Pro-Trump</strong></em> blog. But even that shouldn’t necessarily be of deep concern, because we have so much partisan press already (especially in the UK).</p>
<h2 id="the-punditpropagandist-boundary">The pundit/propagandist boundary</h2>
<p>When should we worry? Well, look at the outlet’s record for truth – if it’s so pro-Trump that it lies for the president, than it’s crossed that hazy line from partisan journalism to straight-up propaganda. And on that charge, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/anti-trump-protesters-bused-into-austin/">they have some form</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Washington Post</em>, a blog owned by tech mogul Jeff Bezos, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/20/blog-known-for-spreading-hoaxes-says-it-will-have-a-correspondent-in-trump-white-house/">has many more examples</a> for you:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Just last week, the Gateway Pundit published the absurd, social media-generated claim that the Washington Post’s Doris Truong had sneakily snapped cellphone photos of notes belonging to secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, during his confirmation hearing. Truong was not at the hearing; it made no sense to think she would have been at the hearing, since she is an editor of The Post’s website.</p>
