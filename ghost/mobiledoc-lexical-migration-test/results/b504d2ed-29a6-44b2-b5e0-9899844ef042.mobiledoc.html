<p>Jonathan Kott went from serving as Manchin’s senior advisor to leading a well-funded dark money group that spent millions to crush Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (Ind.-Vt.) 2020 presidential bid, and then back to Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>As <em>The Lever</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-manchin-aide-turned-corporate-shill/">recently reported</a>, Kott now works as a corporate lobbyist for health insurers, drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, and even Fox News, while the media calls on the so-called “<a href="https://twitter.com/reidepstein/status/1473471440468922368">Manchin whisperer-for-hire</a>” to weigh in on what has motivated his former boss to obstruct the party’s core agenda.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX2m_VhNV_c">our new video</a> detailing Kott’s path through Washington’s proverbial “revolving door” and the lucrative career opportunities available to Democratic Hill staffers who oppose progressives. </p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-manchin-aide-turned-corporate-shill/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/to-save-the-planet-we-must-choose/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather hide from public view.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
