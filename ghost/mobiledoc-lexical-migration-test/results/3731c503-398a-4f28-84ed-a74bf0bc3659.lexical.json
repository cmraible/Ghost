This should not shock any seasoned enthusiast with a passion for straight-line speed. One particular collection shows off Some of the best examples of all time, including some vintage vehicles toward the front of the complex. The owner is quite fond of GM, notably Chevrolet, vehicles as he shows off a pool table in the style of a COPO Camaro. The odd excellent nick nacks and classic project car goes as you pass through the building until you find a room describable only as a masterpiece of automotive collecting.",

Two of these vehicles are examples of the first generation, while the third is a fourth-gen Trans Am. While some may focus on the older models, the fourth generation featured some of the smoothest design and best performance engineering available in the entire Firebird lineup. On the other side of the room is a row of Chevys, Fords, and AMC muscle cars, one particular car being a clear game-changer for the collection.",

As you may have already noticed, the body of this car is coated in a bright Rally Green, which was not available for the vehicle at the time. This car is likely the only Camaro made with a non-chevy-approved color for its production year. Along with the massive V8, slick drag radial tires, and exterior design, this color makes the COPO an extremely unique vehicle. These cars are some of the most remarkable American cars ever made, including everything from the middle row of Corvettes to a rare set of AMCs, making it one of America's most remarkable collections.",
