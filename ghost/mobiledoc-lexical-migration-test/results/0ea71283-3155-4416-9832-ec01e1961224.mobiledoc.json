Some people do the right thing and let one car from the other lane merge in front of them, doing what’s called the “zipper merge” like teeth from a zipper coming together. This, along with whether or not you put your shopping cart into the corral in the story parking lot, determines just what kind of person you are. A Corvette driver recently showed he wasn’t that kind of a courteous person and paid dearly for it."

In fact, that truck could probably roll over the Chevy’s fender and more without breaking a sweat. Plus, is it really going to set the ‘Vette driver back that much to let one vehicle merge in front of him?"

Sure, the other driver could've literally thrown his weight around and might have won, although if there had been a crash he might’ve been cited and had an insurance mess on his hands. We like what he did better."
