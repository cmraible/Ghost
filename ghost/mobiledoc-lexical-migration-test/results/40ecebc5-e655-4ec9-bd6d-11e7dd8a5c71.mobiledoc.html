Now, they can be yours.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Most car collections have a focus. <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This collection</a> is focused on <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/30638/1997-pontiac-trans-am#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">limited edition American cars</a> produced during the 1990s and the 2000s (with a few exceptions). We haven't seen many collections like this.</p>
<p>For many years, Gary Robbins operated a car dealership named Robbins Used Cars. In the process, he procured many interesting vehicles for his personal collection. You can see them <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">in the video posted below</a>, but we'll share a few of our favorites first.</p>

<p>Now, the collection is <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">headed to auction</a>, and we're excited to take a look at <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/30643/1996-chevrolet-corvette#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the vehicles in Robbins' collection</a>. The first car that grabbed our attention was the yellow 1993 Ford Mustang LX 5.0 convertible.</p>
<p>This was a limited edition sold in either triple white or Canary Yellow, as seen here. It's one of just 1,503 produced, and it has <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">just 706 miles</a> on the odometer.</p>

<p>There's another yellow car that grabbed our attention, too. The <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2003 Chevrolet Corvette Z06</a> is one of two C5 Corvettes on offer. With just 16,000 miles, it may be one of the nicest C5 Z06 Corvettes available anywhere.</p>

<p>Another favorite is the <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2003 Roush 380R Mustang</a>. It's good for 380 supercharged horsepower – hence the name – and is one of just 49 built that year. It's also the only automatic produced in the limited run. </p>

<p>Like most of the cars in <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the Robbins collection</a>, this Roush Mustang has exceptionally low miles. It has covered just 4,600 miles since new.</p>
<p>The auction runs from Thursday, November 5 through Saturday, November 7. The auction is being run by <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a> in Greensboro, North Carolina. In addition to the Robbins collection, over 600 other vehicles will be offered.</p>
