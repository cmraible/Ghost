A tall cowl-induction hood secured by hood pins covers the car's powerful engine. Any stripes on the car have since been removed to give the car more of a clean-cut appearance. All sheetmetal is nice and crisp, and all bright chrome trim makes this car appear to have a larger price tag than what it does. On all four corners sit a set of period-correct 15-inch Cragar Mag wheels wrapped with rubber ready to rock the strip (165/80 front, 325/50 rear) with the back sporting Mickey Thompson radials that all fit due to the car being mini-tubbed."
