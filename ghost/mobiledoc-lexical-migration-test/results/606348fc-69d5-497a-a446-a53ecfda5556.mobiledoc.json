Pipes. He discovered that by ingesting content from one of our newspaper sites, and comparing those stories to the content in a specific story, he could automatically create related links to other stories on that site.</span>\n\nAnd that’s a really neat little trick for getting those handy little “related articles” links on the bottom of your posts. Now, doing this sort of thing on a commercial sitre is not without its risks. Relying on free web services can come back to bite you if those free services suddenly close up or change massively. And, as a non-paying customer, you get *exactly* the customer service you paid for. \n\n<div>  \n</div><div>Even so, the balance of cost savings versus potetial risk seems to bias heavily on the side of giving it a go. As Mr Owens puts it:</div><div>  \n</div>> <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Note: There are vendors who provide this service for thousands of dollars. Thanks for one smart developer playing around with the latest, cool open-network tools, GateHouse Media can now make it available on our sites for free.</span>\n\nBig publishing companies tend to seek big publishing solutions. The problem is that the web favours small, agile solutions. Squaring that circle is a huge challenge, and one that’s as much a social one as a technical one.\n\n\n"
