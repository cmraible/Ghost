If you’ve ever driven around in an SS, you know these sedans totally fly under the radar. While they’re plenty fast and loads of fun, one blessed with upgrades from Hennessey Performance Engineering is so much better."

Hennessey installed a number of upgrades, like CNC ported cylinder heads, upgraded valvetrain, HPE camshaft, an HPE air induction system, plus stainless steel long tube headers. Thanks to HPE engine management calibration, all those parts are able to maximize performance. Laying all that to the ground are Michelin Pilot Supersport tires."

          "Sure, you could get a Corvette or a Camaro, but the Chevy SS is a full-size sedan, offering a little more practicality. If you want to bring along up to four other people for a fun drive, you can. The rear seat has plenty of legroom and the trunk is spacious, making for a practical weekend road trip vehicle. Since it’s a sedan, most people won’t really expect it to be a performance car, so if you don’t want to deal with other drivers trying to race or people gawking, this could be an excellent fit."
