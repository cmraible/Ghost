There was more than a dozen vehicles in the parade including emergency vehicles and plenty of pickup trucks, and someone even had an inflatable screen set up on the side of the road showing pictures of the late singer."

He had five top hits in his career including two from 1994 –\"Third Rock From The Sun\" and \"Pickup Man.\" The latter song was an anthem to pickup truck lovers! As for \"John Deere Green,\" that song was released in 1993, and it peaked at number five."
