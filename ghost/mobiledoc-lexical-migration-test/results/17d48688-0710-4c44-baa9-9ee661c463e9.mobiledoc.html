<p>Truly the C8 Corvette has changed the game, putting the American sports car on a level as high or higher than its European competitors. Just look at this ride with head-turning Elkhart Lake Blue Metallic paint that just sparkles like a sapphire in the sun. Making it shine even more are the staggered 5-spoke Carbon Flash-painted aluminum wheels with those sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Adding the right highlights are items like a Carbon Flash rear spoiler and exposed carbon-fiber trim pieces. For good measure, the interior features cool carbon-fiber trim and GT2 bucket seats for that <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form">race car feeling</a>.</p>

<p>You’re really going to snap your head back with the mid-mounted 6.2-liter LT2 V8 engine. It has the appearance package, so you’ll love staring at it through the back window. Even better, you get to feel an amazing 495-horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque when you press that pedal, rocketing you from 0-60 mph in <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form">just 2.9 seconds</a>. That’s made possible with the super advanced 8-speed dual clutch automatic transmission.</p>

<p>While cool, awesome speed is great, <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form">this C8</a> comes with the Z51 Package. That means you get the advantage of the adjustable performance suspension, electronic limited-slip differential, altered axle ratio, big Z51 Brembo brakes, a rumbling sport exhaust, more cooling, and overall just incredible traction when you whip this through turns.</p>
