          "There's no denying that 2020 is a year for the history books that nobody in this lifetime could forget even if they tried. While we are still dealing with a global pandemic that has been spreading like a wildfire doused with gasoline, protests have turned into violent riots across the country following the recent death of George Floyd after his neck was pinned by the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin during an arrest. Businesses, apartments, police stations, you name it, have been completely destroyed and/or set ablaze in cities everywhere.

However, due to the fact that so many were stolen and have been constantly on the move, it has made it almost impossible to flag them down. Even more, the riots are still ongoing keeping law enforcement busier than ever, so they are not able to respond to help locate these stolen vehicles at this time."
