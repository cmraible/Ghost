<p>Last month, we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-secretive-billionaire-handed-his-fortune-to-the-architect-of-the-right-wing-takeover-of-the-courts/">exposed</a> the largest political advocacy donation in U.S. history: a $1.6 billion contribution from Chicago electronics tycoon Barre Seid to Leonard Leo, who masterminded the conservative takeover of the courts. This week, we pulled back the curtain on Seid, detailing how the super-secretive billionaire has channeled his wealth into what he calls “attack philanthropy,” funding causes designed to remake politics and society in a conservative mold.</p>
<p>In this week’s Lever Weekly, we also highlight important reads from other outlets, including a detailed account of California’s bold new moves on climate change, and a report on how Big Tech is helping fossil fuel giants prolong their war on the planet.</p>
<p>Read all about it in this week’s Lever Weekly, exclusively for supporting subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->
