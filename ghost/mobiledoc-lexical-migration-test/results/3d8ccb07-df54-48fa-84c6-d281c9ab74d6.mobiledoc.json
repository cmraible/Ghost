Mikkelson had made up Zarronandia a year before to troll the conservatives who insisted that Snopes was biased toward liberals. But as Snopes sought to level up, Green, then the director of business development, told Mikkelson that he thought they needed to “clean up our loose ends.” That didn’t happen, and Zarronandia was outed as an alt in a BuzzFeed exposé by the reporter Dean Sterling Jones."
