<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<p><strong>Real-time protection</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sophos Home Premium</strong> goes far beyond simply preventing known malware and goes further than traditional, signature-based antivirus protection. The product takes a whole new proactive approach by seeking out and analyzing suspicious behaviors and activities using data gathered by the company’s threat intelligence center, Sophos Labs. This helps ensure you’re protected from any new and developing malware, ransomware, exploits, PUAs (Potentially Unwanted Application), phishing attacks, compromised websites, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy protection</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that cybercriminals can use your webcam or mic to secretly spy on you? That they can use special “keylogger” software to capture everything you’re typing, including your credit card details while you’re online shopping? Sophos Home Premium stops these invasions of privacy in their tracks. The product will alert you when an outside source is attempting to access your webcam or mic, giving you the option to allow or block the action. And, Sophos Home Premium will also encrypt your keystrokes so cybercriminals and key-logger software can’t capture what you’re typing. It’s additional layers of protection to ensure your privacy remains intact.</p>
<p><strong>Remote management</strong></p>
<p>Are you the most tech-savvy user in your family? Are you often asked for help with computer issues from family far and wide? I know I am, definitely more often than I’d like. Anyway, Sophos Home Premium allows you to easily view and manage computer security for anyone in your life – whether they’re in the same house or in another country. Simply add their computer to your account, and then you can address security alerts, change security settings, and run scans from your Cloud Management Dashboard in any web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Available for Mac and Windows</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re a Mac or PC user, Sophos has you covered. The company has a version of Sophos Home Premium for both Mac and Windows. Overall, the product functions the same, however, there are some slight differences in certain features between the two versions.</p>
