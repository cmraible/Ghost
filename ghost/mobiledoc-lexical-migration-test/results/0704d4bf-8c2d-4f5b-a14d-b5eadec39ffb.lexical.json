The most stylish elements of this car are those massive front fenders that are sculpted into the body design and stretch half way into the front doors, while the faired-in rear wheels and the wrap-around chrome grille are other eye-catching details. The two-tone interior looks stunning, and it shows why Packard was a luxury leader in its day.",
