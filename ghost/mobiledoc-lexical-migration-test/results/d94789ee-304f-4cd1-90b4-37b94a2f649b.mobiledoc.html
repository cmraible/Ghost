<hr>
<p>Every model year of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pushy-c8-corvette-driver/">C8 Corvette</a> has involved plenty of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-bowling-ball/">disappointed customers</a> learning their order is being pushed off until the next model year. According to a report from Corvette Blogger, GM is stopping production on the 2023 Corvettes September 1 and production on the 2024 cars begins September 5. Now you can do a happy dance if <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-jumps-c8-corvette/">you’re in line</a> for a C8 Corvette but were wondering if you’d see the thing before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a C8 Corvette get trashed during a street takeover <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-trashed/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This means the vehicle order guide for the 2024 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/super-rare-c8-corvette-sports/">Corvette</a> lineup will be available July 10. As for the visualizer, access to that tool begins on July 18. While people who’re ordering Corvettes will find that indispensable for getting every detail right, it will also be used by countless daydreamers to waste company time while hopefully not getting caught by the boss.</p>

<p>Corvette production hasn’t been exactly smooth in the past few years. Back in February of this year it was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-production-yet-again/">completely halted</a> for a week due to an unspecified parts shortage. The same thing happened in October 2022, March 2022, and May 2021. The only thing GM will say is processing chips isn’t what’s been holding up production.</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/kentucky-tornado-corvette/">tornado</a> that damaged Bowling Green Assembly and some Corvettes back in December 2021, disrupting production and resulting in the damaged cars being scrapped. Sure, it could’ve been much worse, but with so many people desperate to get their hands on a C8 Corvette to experience the mid-engine format, for some all the delays are excruciating.</p>
<p>The report didn’t include a start date for the 2024 Corvette order books opening, so that will be revealed later. Expect a rush to get in line once that announcement is made, because the C8 is still red hot.</p>
