<h3 id="this-three-year-old-gt-r-has-had-70000-spent-on-it-and-has-just-17000-miles-on-the-odometer">This three year old GT-R has had $70,000 spent on it and has just 17,000 miles on the odometer.</h3>
<p>From humble beginnings to one of the most rapid cars money can buy, the GT-R has always been king of power, they even called the R32 Godzilla, now that’s a legacy.</p>
<p>GT-R’s have always had a way of shoe horning supercar levels of power and performance into a comparatively practical and unassuming package, and the R35 like this one offered by <a href="https://drivermotorsports.com/inventory/136/2015-nissan-gt-r">Driver Motorsports</a> is no different.</p>

<p>The standard car could sprint to 60 miles per hour in a barely believable 2.7 seconds, whilst running a quarter mile in just 10.8. This, however, is a heavily modified example.</p>
<p>With over $70,000 of investment this car looks the business, with a $10,000 satin paint job (no, this isn’t a wrap) you can immediately tell this is a classy build.</p>

<p>Featuring a full AMS Alpha 7 package, the plus alludes to the rather naughty Akrapovic titanium exhaust - an upgrade over the standard HKS unit that’s supplied.</p>
<p>On top of all that, a set of Strasse S5 wheels complete the package along with some subtle Seibon carbon accents including the front lip and rear spoiler. Naturally some serious rubber is needed to keep that power on the ground, which thankfully is taken care of by a set of Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires.</p>
<p>The Alpha 7 package certainly adds to the power too, with AMS claiming it’s the final hurdle before swapping out the factory turbos. Despite the stock units remaining in place, 700 horsepower is extracted via this near $12,000 package. 1000cc injectors are thrown in, along with intake upgrades whilst making the car easily upgradeable to the Alpha 9 package. You know, if 700 horsepower isn’t enough for you.</p>
<p>Considering the $70,000 investment in this beast along with just 17,000 miles resting on the clock, the retail price of $94,000 seems rather good value to us.</p>
