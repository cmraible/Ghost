<p>Amid fatal heat waves, worsening droughts, and severe famines, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had the gall to take the stage this week at the Aspen Ideas’ climate conference and declare that climate action is “for the children” — as if the crisis is not unfolding before our eyes.</p>
<p>Along with recapping all our reporting from the last week, this edition of Lever Weekly highlights an <em>Atlantic</em> report about Pelosi’s remarks. As the author notes, such statements are emblematic of a much larger problem: Democrats are so out of touch that they can’t realize the critical opportunity they have to address the climate crisis right now.</p>
<p>Read all about it in this week’s Lever Weekly (formerly Weekend Reader), exclusively for supporting subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-a-mayor-takes-on-housing-profiteers-2/"><strong>YOU LOVE TO SEE IT: A Mayor Takes On Housing Profiteers</strong></a></strong> —<em> “All over the country and beyond, ordinary people are organizing in their communities and workplaces, holding politicians accountable, and winning. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka (D) has unveiled an aggressive housing plan to take on big investors scooping up properties. Workers at Target in Virginia, meanwhile, have filed for a union election, and the EPA has proposed an important new asbestos disclosure rule. On top of that, friend of </em>The Lever <em>Matt Bruenig has put together some awesome new Starbucks union organizing data.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/psaki-joins-the-dems-corporate-career-pipeline/"><strong>Psaki Joins The Dems’ Corporate Career Pipeline</strong></a></strong><em> — “Psaki’s Democratic predecessors have taken similar paths, leaving their press secretary posts to defend corporate Democrats and big business on cable news spots. In fact, every single press secretary of the Clinton and Obama administrations eventually cut out the middleman and went to work directly in corporate PR — ranging from managing crisis communications for the scandal-plagued NFL to setting up Amazon’s vast lobbying and public relations shop.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/mccarthy-era-law-aimed-at-pro-choice-protesters/"><strong>McCarthy-Era Law Aimed At Pro-Choice Protesters</strong></a> —<em> “Even as the Democrats’ feeble legislative attempt to codify federal protections for abortion rights goes down in flames, many Washington elites are directing their attention and anger towards the same target: no, not right-wing judges reaching their ideological hands into millions of people’s bodies, but instead the protesters peacefully demonstrating outside the homes of Supreme Court justices who are about to overturn </em>Roe v. Wade<em>.”<br></em></p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-wall-street-is-taking-over-medicare/"><strong>How Wall Street Is Taking Over Medicare</strong></a> —<em> “The Biden administration’s recent entrenchment and expansion of the Trump administration’s efforts to privatize Medicare is helping a shadowy set of big-business beneficiaries: private equity firms and major health care companies, including one that previously employed the government official overseeing the privatization plan, a </em>Lever<em> analysis shows.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/why-are-dems-suddenly-boosting-an-anti-abortion-candidate/"><strong>Why Are Dems Boosting An Anti-Abortion Candidate?</strong></a></strong> —<em> “A new super PAC led by consultants for Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns is diving into a Texas primary to support a conservative Democrat who opposes abortion.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cheat-sheet-the-truth-about-crypto/"><strong>CHEAT SHEET: The Truth About Crypto</strong></a></strong> —<em> “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies come with an ugly cost: enormous fossil fuel consumption for a highly speculative product that has worsened inequality by generating a growing number of crypto-billionaires. This week’s Cheat Sheet focuses on crypto — what it is, what it does to the world, and how communities are responding to the crypto-takeover.”</em></p>

Missing was any sense that this legislation is a make-or-break moment for the broader Democratic caucus. Gone was any suggestion that if Democrats fail to pass a bill this term, then America’s climate commitment under the Paris Agreement will be out of reach, and worse heat waves, larger wildfires, and damaging famines across the country and around the world within the next decade and a half will be all but assured.”<br></em></p>
