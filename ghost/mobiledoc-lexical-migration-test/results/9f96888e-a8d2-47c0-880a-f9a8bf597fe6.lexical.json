Except The Doctor does this at irregular intervals. And Interhacktives does it once a year.\n\nAbandoning metaphor.\n\nInterhacktives is a website run by the [MA students in Interactive Journalism](http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/interactive-journalism) at City University, and is “supervised” by myself and [Ben Whitelaw of *The Times*](https://twitter.com/benwhitelaw) in the Social Media & Content Strategy module I run. It’s a site that the students are expected to run themselves, and which contributes towards their assessment at the end of the module next year.\n\nThis year’s design is nice, clean and fresh looking:\n\n![Interhacktives on the web](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/11/new-interhacktives-3.png?resize=960%2C976)\n\n\n## Getting responsive\n\nAnd, finally, it’s fully responsive. (Last year’s design had a mobile theme, but not a responsive design.) This is the new look on iPad:\n\n![Interhacktives on iPad](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/11/new-interhacktives2.jpg?resize=960%2C1132)\n\n\n## Mobile-ready\n\nAnd on iPhone:\n\n![Interhacktives on iPhone](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/11/new-interhacktives1.jpg?resize=640%2C1136)\n\n\n## A personal touch\n\nOne touch I really like is the nice, clear and consistently designed [authors page](http://www.interhacktives.com/about/):\n\n![Interhacktives: Contact Us](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/11/new-interhacktives-4.png?resize=960%2C835)\n\nOnly one [actual new article](http://www.interhacktives.com/2014/11/18/6-best-news-sites-data-journalism-uk/) up so far – but I’m looking forwards to seeing what they do with the site.\n\n\n"
