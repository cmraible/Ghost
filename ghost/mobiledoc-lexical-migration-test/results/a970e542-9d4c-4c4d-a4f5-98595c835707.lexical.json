Of course, those brave souls willing to go where no one else dares to travel often come across some insane models. This is quite prevalent with this particular man who makes a living out of finding some of the world's rarest automobiles, repairing them, then sending them off to good homes to be taken care of.

Typically you'd see a letter signifying the engine and carburetor for anyone unfamiliar with the more intimate details of the vehicle, this time not so much. In place of the said number is a blank space that is confusing until you check the buck tag where you will find an R present.",

This car is a scarce vehicle, and after a bit of digging, the guys discovered that the car was used for drag racing and was likely a show stopper at the track.
