And so, I'm taking my own advice, the sort of wisdom I'd deliver in consultancy, and actually building out a schedule and a set of deadlines for myself, before what looks like a very busy October hits. Wish me luck.</p><p>Indeed, I need to listen to my own advice a little bit more often. I was going through a low-level bout of imposter syndrome last week. Rather than wallow in it, I decided to counter it with a little positive action. I took one of my side-projects, and set myself the aim of starting to grow my email list for it week-on-week. I wanted to double the number of subscribers by the end of the month.</p><p>I applied the exact same techniques I recommend in my lecturing and training — and tripled the number of subscribers <em>in a week</em>. Feels good.‌‌‌‌</p><p>Now, I know growth gets harder as time goes by, and that the increase I've managed isn't actually earning me any extra revenue, but it's still nice to put yourself and your skills on the line, and remember that you can still deliver when you have to. And it feels good to kick imposter syndrome in the unmentionables.</p><p>Remember, folks, <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/actual-impostors-dont-get-impostor-syndrome/\">imposters don't get imposter syndrome</a>…</p><p><strong>What should I write next?</strong></p><p>I have four pieces in progress right now. I'm running a Twitter poll to see which I should deliver first. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adders/status/1440280000851103750?s=21\">Please go and vote</a>.</p><p><strong>On with the links.</strong></p>"
