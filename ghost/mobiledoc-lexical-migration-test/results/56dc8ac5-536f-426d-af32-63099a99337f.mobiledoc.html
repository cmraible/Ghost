<p>This incredible <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1997-porsche-911-carrera-targa-3/">1997 Porsche 911</a> is powered by a potent 3.6-liter M64 flat-six engine, becoming an iconic powerhouse within the German automotive enthusiast community. While the power of this legendary block is quite evident, the engine was rated at a genuinely impressive 282 horsepower and 250 ft/lbs of torque from the factory. All of that power is transferred through a four-speed Tiptronic automatic transaxle, which is desirable for this model. The gearbox allows for quick acceleration and bountiful power transfer and lets you enjoy some low-speed cruising. </p>
