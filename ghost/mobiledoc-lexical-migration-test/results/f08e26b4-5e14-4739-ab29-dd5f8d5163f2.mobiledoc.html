<p>David and <em>The Lever</em>’s reporters will be offering their analysis on everything, from the races that could determine which party will control Congress, to what voters are saying in exit polls, to how corporate media is spinning the results. Join us on election night as we learn the results along with the audience (while hopefully not going too crazy).</p>
