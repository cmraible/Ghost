While it's hard not to love a fab classic, a staunch dedication to historical accuracy can definitely stand between some enthusiasts and '50s-era metal. Heck, even if you are a stickler for factory specs, it's still nice to see something a bit different every now and then. That's why this cool resto-mod is such a refreshing change of pace."

A low, sleek profile replaced the first gen's carried-over, 1940s lines, officially marking the arrival of the “Hot One”. This Nomad retains much of its factory charm thanks to what appears to be a largely rust-free life that was devoid of catastrophic events. When the time came for restoration, the car's solid panels were massaged flat in preparation for striking red and white two-stage. And not only does that highly polished pigment present well from all angles, it provides a rolling testament to top-notch metalwork and years of stellar care. Detailing begins with a polished, body-width bumper, which props a gold Bel Air grille behind a pristine Chevrolet crest and two clear parking lamps."
