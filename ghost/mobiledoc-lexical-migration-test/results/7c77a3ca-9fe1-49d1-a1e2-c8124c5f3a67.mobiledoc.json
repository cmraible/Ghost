The license plate in question was issued in 1904 by the city of Chicago and simply features the number 1, that’s it. All these factors combined for a crazy bidding war and that final bid, making the seller undoubtedly quite happy."

Before that, the city provided metal numbers and the owner had to mount them to leather or wood for display on the car. Starting in 1905 the city made the plates of brass since the aluminum plates were damaged easily. That means this is one of the few survivors."
