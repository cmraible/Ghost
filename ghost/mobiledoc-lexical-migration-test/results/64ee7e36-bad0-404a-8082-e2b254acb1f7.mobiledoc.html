<p>While most of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/sports/">sporting </a>world has been put on hold this summer due to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fl-man-lamborghini-huracan-covid-fraud/">COVID-19</a>, Patrick Mahomes has been on fire this year. Mahomes celebrated his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rob-gronkowski/">Super Bowl</a> win, huge contract extension and partial baseball team ownership by purchasing a brand-new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2018-ferrari-812-superfast/">Ferrari 812 Superfast</a>, according to a social media post from ESPN football analyst Louis Riddick.</p>

<p>This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/three-ferraris-poised/">Ferrari</a>'s base price of $335,000 is practically a drop in the bucket considering the monster 10-year, $503 million contract extension Mahomes recently signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. In just three seasons as a professional, he is a two-time MVP, and this signing came just months after he led the Chiefs to a Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Just this week, it was announced that Mahomes had purchased a stake in the Kansas City Royals baseball team.</p>
<p>Just like Mahomes, the Ferrari 812 Superfast is known for its power and speed. This sleek <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/exotic/">exotic </a>sports car is powered by a 6.5-liter V12 that is rated at 788 horsepower and 529 lb-ft of torque, and this engine screams with a redline of 8,900 rpm. With a curb weight of just under 3,600 pounds (or about the same as a base 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/ford-mustang/">Ford Mustang</a>), the 812 Superfast is definitely fast with a 0-60 mph time of under 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 211 mph. The Twitter post shows a beautiful example of the car, too, wearing a dark gray paint job, 20-inch black forged racing wheels and yellow brake calipers.</p>
