<hr>
<p>Back in February, California State University, Fullerton received an "astronomical" donation of 15 classic cars worth an estimated $10 million from longtime donors Nicholas and Lee Begovich. Nicholas passed away on May 3 at the age of 98, but his collection of cars will live on thanks to the Audrain Automobile Museum in Newport, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The collection consists mainly of European sports cars from the '50s, '60s and '70s including a 1952 Jaguar XK120, 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing, 1973 DeTomaso Pantera and a 1975 Ferrari Dino 208 GT4. Mr. Begovich was a retired engineering executive, and he had been collecting cars since the early 1950s, but the highlights of his collection are a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster with less than 11,000 miles, a 1964 Porsche 904 with 2,837 km and a 1969 Lamborghini Miura with 3,758 km â€“ all of which were purchased brand new by Mr. Begovich. </p>
<p>The money raised will go to fund scientific and engineering research at CSUF. Of the $10 million, $7 million will go to the university's Center for Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy for a state-of-the-art laboratory, and the remaining $3 million will fund research for sustainable energy at CSUF's College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.</p>
<p>In the following video posted along with the original donation announcement, Mr. Begovich hopes that this donation helps to inspire future donors as much as it helps to educate future students.</p>
