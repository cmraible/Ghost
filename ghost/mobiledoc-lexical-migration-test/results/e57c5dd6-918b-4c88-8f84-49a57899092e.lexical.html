<p>For those who somehow missed the original, the combination of <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and Porsche might seem a little odd. If you did catch <em>Top Gun</em> when it hit theaters in 1986, you were delighted not only by the amazing aerial stunts but also the fact a black <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1958-porsche-356a-speedster-auction/">1958 Porsche 356 Speedster</a> driven by astrophysicist Charlie Blackwood, played by Kelly McGillis. That tradition was carried on with a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1973-porsche-911-targa/">1973 Porsche 911 S</a> driven by Penny Benjamin, played by Jennifer Connelly. A lot of people who have seen the new movie only know it’s a Porsche, so we’re here to dig into its history as well as the story of the Porsche in the original <em>Top Gun</em> film.</p>

<p>About that 1958 Porsche 356 Speeder – it was a replica, not an original. This happens a lot in movies for a variety of reasons, like maybe the production crew couldn’t secure the exact car wanted for a certain look. In this case, they turned to Intermeccanica, a well-known builder of Speedster replicas based out of Canada. The result is enough to fool most people into believing the classic sports car is genuine, all without any Hollywood magic.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1973-porsche-911-carrera-rs-2/">1973 Porsche 911</a> S is a numbers-matching car, not a replica, making it quite the impressive movie star. Lent to the production crew by Nick Psyllos, a San Diego resident, it was actually driven by Connelly for filming instead of a stunt double. For Psyllos this was a wise move since he’s added to the car’s value by allowing it to star in a blockbuster which undoubtedly will be loved by so many.</p>
<p>Made from 1967 to 1973, the 911 S or the sports version of Porsche’s grand tourer established several firsts for the 911 lineup. It was the first engine derivative, boasting a meaty 160-horsepower when it first emerged with the 2.0-liter flat-six for ’67 and ‘68, with output being bumped to 190-hp, thanks to the 2.4-liter engine. Combined with tighter handling and a lower curb weight, it was the 911 of choice for those who wanted to drive hard. Many will note it wore Fuchs wheels before any other, with the five-spoke design quickly becoming a favorite of many enthusiasts, an affinity that is alive and well in the fanbase today. The movie car proudly wears its Fuchs.</p>
