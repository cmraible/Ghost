<p>In the weeks since its reveal, and just before it goes on sale to the public, it seems that the bloom has fallen off the Samsung Galaxy S5’s rose. Most tech writers and critics have thrown their interest behind the HTC One M8 in terms of Android handsets, while the last time anyone had anything to say about Samsung’s phones was the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/2/5464422/ellen-takes-a-selfie-at-the-oscars-sponsored-by-samsung" target="_blank">selfie seen round the world at the Oscars</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">—and that was using a Galaxy Note 3. But a post on </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://bgr.com/2014/04/07/galaxy-f-photos-leak-specs/" target="_blank">BGR</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> today points to a Samsung-made handset that could be the high-end smartphone that critics have been hoping for.</span></p>
<p>Images of the handset first popped up on the Twitter page for <a href="https://twitter.com/WindyLeak">@WindyLeak</a>:</p>

<p>From there, Italian tech site <a href="http://samsung.hdblog.it/2014/04/07/samsung-galaxy-f-lo-speaker-potrebbe-essere-laterale-come-note-3/" target="_blank">HDBlog</a> announced that the mystery device is the Galaxy F, “the premium version of the Galaxy S5.” Beyond reposting the images from @WindyLeak, the post provided some speculation that the handset possesses a quad HD display, with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels—higher resolution than the S5, which clocks in at an already impressive 1920 x 1080 p. The Galaxy F’s display is said to measure at 5.2-inches, which is only a tenth of an inch larger than the S5’s. These rumors have been making the rounds on the Internet for the last few days from various tech sites, but it’s really anyone’s guess as to whether or not they have any actual basis in reality. Even still, they bear some exploration.</p>

<p>The Galaxy F is said to pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805, an Adreno 420 GPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, and a 16 megapixel rear camera (with a 2 megapixel lens on the front). The S5 uses Snapdragon 801—both chips are quad-core, but the 805 can deliver up to 2.7GHz of performance, while the 801 can go up to 2.45GHz. The S5 also has 2GB of RAM, which is plenty. So, of course, 3GB of RAM in the Galaxy F sounds like it’d be a tech fan’s dream.</p>
<p>In short, the Galaxy F—or whatever it is—could definitely be an upgraded version of the S5 if these specs are real. So is Samsung planning on releasing this thing? Or is it just a prototype that managed to find its way out of the factory? Is there really even demand for a smartphone even faster and more powerful than the S5, which is already a pretty damn powerful piece of tech?</p>
