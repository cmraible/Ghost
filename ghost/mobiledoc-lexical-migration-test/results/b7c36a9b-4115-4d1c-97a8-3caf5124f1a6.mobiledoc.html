<p>I might well end up doing a longer post on this, once its percolated through my brain a little more, but this is a typically insightful piece from Nick Carr:</p>
<blockquote>Context collapse remains an important conceptual lens, but what’s becoming clear now is that a very different kind of collapse — content collapse — will be the more consequential legacy of social media. Content collapse, as I define it, is the tendency of social media to blur traditional distinctions among once distinct types of information — distinctions of form, register, sense, and importance. As social media becomes the main conduit for information of all sorts — personal correspondence, news and opinion, entertainment, art, instruction, and on and on — it homogenizes that information as well as our responses to it.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Nick's core thesis is that while social media initially collapsed context, by pulling all interaction into a single, and often public, place, people have responded to that by recreating context through — say — WhatsApp groups. But a more Carr's idea of Content Collapse is more serious — it's like the content atomisation I talk about in my training and lecturing being amplified to the <em>n</em>th degree. </p>

<p>This is a fascinating analysis of what the last week or so has told us about the way that Facebook views the press, itself — and its own story:</p>

<h2 id="tiktok-fights-toxicity-with-regional-teams">TikTok fights toxicity with regional teams</h2>
<p>TikTok is organising its moderation efforts by region:</p>
<blockquote>The Chinese-owned app, which has amassed over 1bn monthly users in just three years, will also outsource all decision-making about what videos are acceptable to its local teams in the US, Europe and India after running into criticism about whether it is censoring content along Chinese government guidelines.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Lots of interesting stuff about its comparable levels of toxicity to the other platforms at similar stages of their development. One question goes unanswered, though: is the moderation done at the supply side, the demand side or both? Do they moderate European videos in Europe for the whole world — or do they moderate the world's videos in Europe for Europe?</p>

<p>One of the advantage of being an old school blogger is that I still use RSS. And sometime, posts still appear in the RSS feed <em>after</em> they've been deleted from the blog they were posted to — which is how I know that Vimeo has a social video creator in beta, despite the post announcing it being deleted…</p>
