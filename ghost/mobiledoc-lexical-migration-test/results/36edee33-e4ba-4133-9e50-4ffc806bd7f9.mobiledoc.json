It’s mated to a 4-speed manual transmission, something which isn’t too common and definitely is desirable for enthusiasts. The dual exhaust and mufflers are new, so this car purrs like a kitten. The odometer on this American Motors AMX reads just a little over 32,000 miles, but you be the judge of whether or not that’s accurate for the age and condition of the car."

It helped turn plenty of heads at a time when American Motors’ future looked shaky, so the historical importance of the AMX is pretty high.
