          "An unnamed 59-year-old man in Rowan County, North Carolina recently came across his dream car, a 1969 Plymouth Road Runner, on the ListedBuy website. He liked the price and the muscle car looked good, so he arranged for a wire transfer of $23,400 to be sent to a bank in Florida. The agreement was that the North Carolina man would receive the Plymouth within 9 days of the receipt of those funds, but it never showed up."

We’re willing to bet these people opened the bank account using a stolen identity, so there’s at least one more victim in this transaction."

While the lister might have all kinds of pictures of the vehicle, that doesn’t mean they even own it or are legit in any way. If you can find a seller who has had a profile on a website for a long time, complete with reviews from the past, that helps."

That dealer has a reputation you can check out, so if they’re legit they will strive to provide you with a fair deal and good service. In other words, you won’t wire money for a car and end up with nothing."
