The majority of the 1970s and well into the 1980s were an automotive performance wasteland in America, a point Europeans like to laugh about while they possibly hurtling toward something similar in the near future. Anyway, with American cars getting hotter as the 80s progressed, a real performance bargain re-emerged, the fabled Firebird Formula."

That opened up a whole world of performance for many younger drivers who were sick of driving econoboxes that did 0-60 in 12 seconds. Yes, it didn’t have the swagger of the Mustang GT, but Ford’s move in 1985 set off a chain of events that eventually led to the creation of the 3rd Gen Firebird Formula which was both affordable and flashy."

Pontiac decided to offer the Formula once more, allowing buyers to get the Trans Am’s top engine in a less expensive package. In fact, base MSRP for the Formula was just over $10,000. This meant Pontiac could compete directly against the 5.0 Mustang LX."
