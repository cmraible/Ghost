<p>At the heart of the idea of content strategy is an acknowledgement that print and digital are very different beasts, borne of different ages. We need to reshape our thinking from the ground up. And there’s one central concept that dominates this thinking: <em><strong>attention</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-attention-crisis">The Attention crisis</h2>
<p><br>By driving down the cost of publishing, the web has created a massive boom in content. Some of it is reliable and compelling, some if it is…uh…less so. What is without question is that there is an overwhelming tide of it coming everyone’s way. A “<a href="https://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2013/05/doug-kessler-content-marketing-strategy.html">tidal wave of crap</a>”, as it was once memorably described.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information </strong>used to be scarce.</li>
    <li><strong>Attention </strong>is the new scarce resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the principle currency of digital is - in many ways - time. There’s the reader’s time, which is precious, and then they’re your time as a journalist, which is the constraining resource on what you produce. (In the paper days, it was space available in the publication.)</p>
<p>Some businesses have responded to this by massively increasing the volume of content they put out - this is the <em>Mail Online </em>or <em>HuffPo </em>model. They are “trawlers”, looking for attention with wide, deep nets to catch as many people as possible. At the other end of the scale we have proliferating niche sites, who are “spear fishing” for targeted audiences, who can often be more valuable in various ways. The latter is a way of matching our content output to a strategy readers adopt to manage their attention: focusing down on the niches that they’re most passionate about.</p>
<p>Much of content strategy is about matching our time to the information needs of our readers in a way that is time effective for us.</p>
<h3 id="the-quartz-curve">The Quartz Curve</h3>
<p>How long should an article be online?</p>
<p>We’ve been through several iterations of that as an industry.</p>
<ol>
    <li><em>“Short”</em> - which made perfect sense in the 1990s, when the internet was slow, and screens were flickery and difficult to read on.</li>
    <li><em>“As long as it needs to be” - </em>again, a position that seems to make perfect sense. Once you’re freed from the space constraints of paper, you can give a story exactly as many words as is needed to tell it compellingly and clearly - but no more or less.</li>
    <li>“Less than 500 or more than 800 word” - err, what? This idea was first articulated by Kevin Delaney of <em>Quartz, </em>in a <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/-smartden-why-quartz-does-not-publish-500-to-800-word-articles/s2/a554444/">talk he gave in London</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>He explained the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/30/quartz-mobile-first-business-data-nuggets"><em>idea further to The Guardian:</em></a></p>
<blockquote>We call it the Quartz curve. The place between 500 and 800 words is the place you don't want to be because it's not short and fast and focused and shareable, but it's not long enough to be a real pay-off for readers</blockquote>
<p>The actual numbers seem to vary substantially from publication to publication, but the underlying principle is the same - and actually is more about time than word counts. Readers seem to exist in one of two modes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>a “lean forward” mode where they just want the news in as efficient a format as possible.</li>
    <li>a “lean back” mode, where they are prepared to commit time to reading, and want to be repaid with a satisfying depth to the content.</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, the failing articles are too short to be satisfying “lean back content”, but aren’t short and punchy enough to make good, efficient news reads.</p>
<p>Looks like we <em>can</em> bring the good old inverted pyramid with us from the print days…</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="stock-and-flow">Stock and Flow</h2>
<p><br>For another example of the difference between print and digital, let’s look at the characteristics of print. Print is <strong>fixed</strong> - in the sense that once you’re sent it to press, there’s no way you’re changing that story. On the other hand, it’s <strong>transitory</strong>. It’s designed to be read this day, week or month.</p>
<p>Digital is very different. Pages published to the web are <strong>mutable</strong> - they can be changed whenever you see fit, at any time in the future. They can be essentially <strong>permanent</strong>, though. Many websites have been online for 20 years now - and the pages published in the first week are still online and accessible.</p>
<p>This brings us both problems and opportunities. For example, one of the problems is the fact that we tend to write in a time relative manner – “yesterday”, “today”, “next week” – which makes perfect sense for transitory print product, rooted, as they are, in a particular point in time. It makes much less sense online, where that story may be read months or years after you published it. This is why some older article suddenly spring back into life, zombie-like, with bursts of unexpected traffic. (Obituaries are notorious for this, as people who missed the death at the time discover that a celeb is dead, fail to check the date, and assume they’ve just died…)</p>
<p>However the opportunity here is in the development of evergreen content - content which can be useful and attract readers over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Content theory divides online content into two broad categories: stock and flow.</p>
<h3 id="flow-content">Flow Content</h3>
<p>Flow content is content designed to be consumed in a particular point of time, and then fade into irrelevance. The traditional news story falls into this category - but so do most social media posts.</p>
<h3 id="stock-content">Stock Content</h3>
<p>Stock content is designed to be consumed - and deliver traffic - over long periods of time. It can be evergreen content, whose value is not time-specific, or it can be content whose usefulness recurs on predictable or unpredictable cycles, depending on news events. It may well need updating and revising over that time, to keep it current and useful. And while it may not deliver big spikes of traffic, it may deliver very large volumes over long periods of time.<br></p>
<p>This concept was first <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890">articulated by Robin Sloane</a>, and I riffed on the idea for <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news-commentary/-we-haven-t-even-scratched-surface-of-explainer-journalism-/s6/a556585/">journalism.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>One example of a site that is substantially built around the idea of stock content is <a href="https://www.vox.com">Vox</a>. It does publish newsy pieces, but always with an eye to their long-term value.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-completion">The value of completion</h2>
<p>There’s one major thing you can do with newspapers and magazines that you just can’t do with the web: finish it. Why is this important? Well, if you complete something, you gain both a sense of satisfaction but also a sense of being informed or up-to-date. This psychological benefit of contained formats is an emerging trend in online content.</p>
<p>It’s behind the rise in curated <strong>newsletters</strong> - which are an attention-efficient format for producing news and for <em>consuming </em>it. From Quartz’s trail-blazing <a href="https://qz.com/daily-brief/">Daily Brief</a>, to efforts like <em>The Times’s <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/newsletter-signup-redbox-925pqzzpj">Red Box</a>, </em>newsletters allow us an unmediated relationship with our readers, without Google or Facebook getting in the way, and allows our readers to outsource the management of their attention to us.</p>
<h3 id="curation">Curation</h3>
<p>Indeed, that “editing” power of the media is a substantial opportunity, identified years ago. Edelman’s Steve Rubel wrote the following <a href="http://adage.com/article/steve-rubel/attention-crash-a-kind-dot-bust/117325/">way back in 2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The attention crisis is an epidemic. There's no more room at the inn. People will cut back. The key question is: What will they trim? Ad-supported media, or content from peers?<em><br>Some will crave the media's ability to edit; others will want to stay closer to their friends. What's unmistakable is that choices will be made.”</em></blockquote>
<p><br>The ability to stay closer to your friends - and have them filters the content for you - is one of the cornerstones of Facebook. The other half of Rubel’s equation is now being tested by the media, as some titles seek to do <em>less </em> but better and more relevant content. The <a href="https://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2016/03/times-digital-editions-relaunch.html">edition model of The Times </a>is one example of this.</p>
<p>Indeed, as journalism professor Jeff Jarvis identified years ago, the very structure of the web - and the links that build it, <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2007/02/22/new-rule-cover-what-you-do-best-link-to-the-rest/">mean that you can do what you do best and link to the rest</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and those links have consequences, too.</p>

<h2 id="content-atomisation">Content Atomisation</h2>
<p>Think about where traffic comes from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search engines</li>
    <li>Social media</li>
    <li>Links on other site</li>
    <li>Internal links</li>
    <li>Newsletters</li>
    <li>Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these tend to lead people to the article page, not the home page. They can also break apart the notion of the site, as people consume individual pages from sites all over the web.</p>
<p>This has two major effects:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You have to treat <em>every</em> page as if it was a homepage. Think about how to move readers on to others stories. There is no equivalent online to the NiB (news in brief) at the bottom of page 7 – because every single page online has to build up its own social shares and search ranking.</li>
    <li>You have to <em>rethink </em>the homepage. The print style “featured lead article” rarely works well online - it’s much more about presenting readers with a menu of content they can choose for. Some theorists have talked about the death of the homepage. This is premature - a well-thought out and intelligently managed homepage can be a valuable resource - especially if you acknowledge that it’s often the second page people visit, not the first.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2 id="multimedia-publishing">Multimedia publishing</h2>
<p><br>We’re still not great - as an industry - at building truly multimedia stories, once that incorporate different forms of media within a single piece of storytelling. The movement started some years ago with the <em>NYT</em>’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek">Snowfall</a>, but has not really gathered significant pace, as most organisations fall back on traditional formats - or save the full multimedia treatment for only the biggest stories.</p>
<p>However, some tools have emerged to make it much easier to produce stories like this, with simple drag’n’drop interfaces that allow some sophisticated multimedia creation in a fairly easy way. :</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://shorthand.com">Shorthand</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://atavist.com">Atavist</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Increasingly, CMSes like <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> (which you're reading this page on right now) and <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> support this natively.</p>

<h2 id="platform-publishing">Platform publishing</h2>
<p>The emergence of mobile apps and the publishing platforms they have enabled has offered us the ability to repackage content again. A Snapchat Discover channel or our own app can give people a contained experience, which is almost print-like in its nature. But remember the challenge of attention - it’s not about loads of content, it’s about the right content.</p>
<p>Platforms also allow us to reach out to people where they are – often on social media. But that can come at a price, namely that they rarely leave those platforms and make their way to our own sites. The choice to follow the platform publishing route is a challenging one, and one you need to consider the benefits of before throwing your precious time behind it.</p>
<p>Can you reasonably make revenue from these platforms? If so, great! But that might now be the only motive. The <a href="https://digiday.com/uk/wall-street-journal-learned-snapchat-discover/"><em>WSJ</em></a><em></em> and<em><a href="https://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2017/04/economist-plays-platform-game.html"><em>The Economist</em></a></em> are using social platforms as a way of reaching out and finding their future subscribers.</p>

<h3 id="amp-apple-news-and-instant-articles">AMP, Apple News and Instant Articles</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, three major players have launched their own dedicated news formats, that promise high performance, good reach and opportunities for monetisation. Their impact has been variable to say the least. Here are the major formats:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Facebook Instant Articles have been a mixed bag. Facebook have been pushing them strongly, but some <a href="https://digiday.com/media/facebook-faces-increased-publisher-resistance-instant-articles/">publishers have withdrawn</a>, citing a lack of revenue. The site is hoping its <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/09/facebooks-about-to-launch-its-news-subscriptions-initiative-the-new-york-times-is-reportedly-sitting-out-the-washington-post-is-in/">new subscriptions offering</a> will help. Here’s Facebook’s <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/getting-started/">guide to getting started</a>.</li>
    <li>Apple News has been something of a <a href="https://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2017/10/apple-news-success-story.html">quiet success story</a>. There’s a guide to publishing to Apple News <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">on Apple’s site</a>, and a more <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">reader-friendly version at iMore</a>. Apple News Plus has now rolled out in the UK - it looks like a means of monetising atomised content. Some publishers are seeing great results, some, well, less so. </li>
    <li>Probably the most successful format has been Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages - with some <a href="https://digiday.com/media/guardian-getting-60-percent-google-mobile-traffic-amp/">publishers seeing big results</a>. Here’s <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create/?format=websites">how you get started</a>.</li>
