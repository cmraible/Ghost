<hr>
<p>Dealerships have become criminals’ vending machines in the middle of the night where they can go and steal whatever they like. We’ve seen so many cases of crooks breaking into a dealer showroom, swiping keys, and unlocking whatever vehicle they want to take, it’s almost normal and that’s disgusting. However, this story out of Nashville, Tennessee of a Dodge Charger stolen from a used car dealer puts a new twist on the dealership theft story.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a car collection get flooded after Hurricane Ian <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/youtubers-car-collection-floods/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>According to a local report, two guys were leaving a used car dealership in the stolen Mopar muscle car when they got in an accident with another vehicle. This isn’t the first time suspects have wrecked out after stealing a ride from a dealer, so that’s not the twist.</p>
<p>After the crash, someone in the other ride shot the two people in the stolen car. The thieves-turned-shooting-victims fled the scene, probably because they were afraid the other party was going to shoot them even more, probably to the point they would be mostly dead.</p>
<p>Pulling into a neighborhood, the two shot suspects started knocking on doors and asking for help. Mind you, it was after 2 in the morning so probably not a lot of people were okay with opening up their door and letting two guys bleeding out inside. However, that doesn’t mean anyone was surprised by the disturbance in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>“It’s a fairly common thing,” a neighbor who heard the gunshots on his front door camera told a local reporter. “Six to eight blocks you hear these things. But honestly, right now, I got to say I am not particularly disturbed because I just discovered this.”</p>
<p>In other words, crime is so bad in that part of Nashville people just aren’t shocked by it anymore. Someone did call for help instead of letting the suspects bleed out. The 17-year-old and 20-year-old were transported to the hospital for treatment of their injuries, but were about to be charged for car theft at the time of the report. It’s almost like crime is risky business.</p>
