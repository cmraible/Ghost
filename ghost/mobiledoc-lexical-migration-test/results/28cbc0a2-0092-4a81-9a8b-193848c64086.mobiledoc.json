Automakers routinely float rumors to media, enthusiasts’ circles, etc. on purpose to see how people react, gauging how much market interest there might be. Sometimes this results in a concept being created or even a production model. Other times, the feedback helps automakers steer in a different direction."

Considering Ford has slapped the Mustang name on an all-electric crossover, we think making a Raptor version of the pony car would be a good olive branch to enthusiasts. So would be taking the pony badges off the Mach-E."
