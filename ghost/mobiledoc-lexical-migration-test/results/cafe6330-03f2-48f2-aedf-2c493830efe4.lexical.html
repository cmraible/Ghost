<p>The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. The one percent wants us as discombobulated as possible so that we don’t have the energy to push forward, even with so much at stake. But despite their efforts to wear us down, good things are happening!</p>
<p>Congress finally took action to save the U.S. Postal Service, the number of unionized Starbucks has doubled, teachers in Minneapolis are striking for their students, Santa Barbara County stopped Exxon in its quest to reopen a dangerous pipeline, and the D.C. city council passed one of the strongest renter protections since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>All that and much more in today’s You Love To See It, exclusive for supporting subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>Congress <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/agency-oversight/2022/03/usps-reform-bill-offering-much-needed-reset-on-its-finances-passes-senate/">finally</a> repealed the nonsensical requirement that the Postal Service pre-fund its retiree health benefits up to 75 years in the future. The legislation also protected Saturday deliveries. This will go a long way to ensuring the long-term survival of America’s oldest social program.</p>

<p>The number of unionized Starbucks locations in the country has now <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/money/starbucks-workers-at-3-more-ny-stores-vote-to-unionize/?ipid=promo-link-block1">doubled</a>. More than 100 stores have launched unionization campaigns, and Starbucks workers in Denver have gone on strike against Starbucks’ union-busting efforts. Local shift supervisor Michaela Sellaro <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/some-starbucks-workers-plan-to-strike-in-denver/">told</a><em>FOX31</em>: “We are striking today to call attention to Starbucks’ retaliatory and intimidating actions, including but not limited to: cutting hours … baseless final warnings for (alleged violations of) vague and inconsistently enforced policies, and spying on and otherwise monitoring pro-union partners and their activities.”</p>
<p>In other union news, 4,500 teachers in Minneapolis are <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/minneapolis-strike-teachers-kids-83352238">on strike</a> to demand “reduced caseloads for special education teachers, school psychologists, social workers and counselors. [The union is] also seeking increased reserves of special education aides and others to help teachers,” <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/minneapolis-strike-teachers-kids-83352238">according</a> to the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p>

<p>While Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/despite-pledge-biden-still-fighting-student-debtors-in-court/">continues to violate</a> his oft-repeated pledge to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is putting <a href="https://coag.gov/press-releases/3-10-22/">pressure</a> on Colorado’s U.S. Attorney to stop hurting student loan borrowers in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“The past two years highlighted the challenges student loan borrowers can face and the importance of grace for those in difficult circumstances,” Weiser <a href="https://coag.gov/press-releases/3-10-22/">said</a> in a press release. “It is important that student loan borrowers facing bankruptcy have a clear path to having their loans discharged as promised in the Bankruptcy Code. I encourage the Justice Department to carefully consider its role in such cases and to extend grace to student loan borrowers who face an ‘undue hardship’ in repaying their loans.”</p>

They just <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-environment-california-environment-santa-barbara-4782375253c78149afd6c61a67e0ca0d">rejected</a> an ExxonMobil trucking proposal that was integral to reopening a pipeline that had been shut down in 2015 due to a massive oil spill.</p>

On March 4, ​​“the D.C. Council <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/03/01/dc-bans-evictions-over-unpaid-rent-under-600/">permanently barred</a> landlords from filing evictions against tenants who owe less than $600, sealed some eviction records, and further protected voucher holders during the rental screening process in an omnibus tenant protection bill… the bill is one of the strongest and most comprehensive bills in the country related to tenant protections in some time,” according to <em>DCist</em>.</p>
