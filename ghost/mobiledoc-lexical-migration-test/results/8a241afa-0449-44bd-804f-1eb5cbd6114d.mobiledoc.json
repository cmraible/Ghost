Not only that, they put the Confederate flag on the roof, a move which is so controversial that even Jay Leno opted out of it for his show recently. And they included a detail so many miss, the “General Lee” along the sides of the roof. In other words, this certainly looks the part of a modern General Lee. Oh, and it even has the same horn."

More importantly, it has unibody construction and the fully independent suspension. Those two factors matter plenty when jumping a car, especially when it comes to how well it takes the hit on impact."
