This is why the CDC counsels scrubbing your hands with soap for 20 seconds, since the friction can damage the protection envelope around a coronavirus, eliminating the threat. You can use the same principle with your car’s interior, but don’t rub so hard you damage any surfaces. The risk is especially real with cracking leather, painted plastic, and so on."
