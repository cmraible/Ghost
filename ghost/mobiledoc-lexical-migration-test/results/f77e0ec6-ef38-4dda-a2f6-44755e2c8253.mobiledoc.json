Same goes for those wire-spoke knock-off wheels, plus the glass doesn’t appear to have bullet holes but maybe that would’ve made it even cooler."

That’s especially true since none of the other 7 movie cars have been released to be sold to the public. Plus, this one was damaged during filming, so it’s like you have a little slice of the production chaos. This replica comes with a 3.2-liter straight-six engine paired to a 6-speed manual transmission."

One could argue the movies made the British car a hot commodity, but you could just as easily argue the vehicle made the early films the success we all know today. Either way, these classics are absolutely iconic, with original examples easily selling in the 7 digits."

That’s a lot of cash for it not being an original production car and being damaged. Obviously, the auction house is banking on providence driving the price far beyond what one would normally expect. It’ll be interesting to see if the estimate is spot-on, low, or high."
