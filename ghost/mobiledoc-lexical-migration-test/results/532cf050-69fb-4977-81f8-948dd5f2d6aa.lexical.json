This time it’s Albert Antonacci who uncovered a rare 1979 Porsche 928 in Walton, New York. While cleaning out his late father Umberto’s garage, the man uncovered the classic sports car. Now, most people would rightfully get super worked up over a classic Porsche 911, but a 928 not so much. However, this car supposedly is a rare spec, so Albert feels pretty lucky.",
