On top of that, it's got a wicked convertible top so that the drivers and passengers can also partake in celebrating what is pretty much the pinnacle of early ‘90s SUVs. Of course, the transmission is a pretty tough one as well to handle all of that torque but probably the truck’s biggest attractive feature is its style.",
