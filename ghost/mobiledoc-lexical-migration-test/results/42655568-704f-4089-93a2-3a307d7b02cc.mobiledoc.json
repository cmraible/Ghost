Captured by the shop's security footage, the heat from the truck fire caused a nearby truck's fuel tank to give way and explode which sent diesel gas spilling on the ground of the lot. The spilled diesel fuel ignited which completely immersed a neighboring lumberyard into flames along with a building next to the shop."

Even more, the fire department showed up after the fire had already been burning for about 20 minutes, but they parked at the wrong building. Once the firetruck was in the right spot to fight the fire, Benton Performance was a total loss. In fact, Southern California has already played victim to wildfires that have already devoured thousands of acres of nearby land that has evacuated both locals and businesses."
