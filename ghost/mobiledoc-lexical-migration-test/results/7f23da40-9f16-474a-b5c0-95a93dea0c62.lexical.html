<p>Just a few days ago, Nintendo Japan announced that they will be selling a new Switch bundle that didn’t include the dock, Joy-Con grip, AC adapter and HDMI Cable for 24,980 Yen (5000 Yen cheaper than the original bundle).</p>

<p>When this was announced, we in the west began to ask whether we will be getting the same treatment for a cheaper, more portable, bundle. However, Nintendo just announced that they currently have no plans to bring this bundle outside of Japan.</p>
<p>It’s a shame considering many families already have a Switch dock plugged into their TV and they would just like a second device for another family member. But who knows, perhaps the bundle will prove to be very successful and they’ll reconsider?</p>
