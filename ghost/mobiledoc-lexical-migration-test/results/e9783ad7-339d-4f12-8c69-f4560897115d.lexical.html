<hr>
<p>Usually when you see a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby Cobra</a> it’s not one of the original production cars from back in the day. That doesn’t make them unimpressive, but it does mean when one of those original roadsters is on display you’re in for a special treat. Even better is seeing a 1965 Shelby 427 Cobra Competition since only 23 were made. That’s what was on <em>Jay Leno’s Garage</em> recently and we apparently have the wildfires to thank for making that happen. Yep, Leno lent some garage space for this homeless car until the raging California infernos calmed down.</p>
<p>To give you a perspective of how valuable these 427 Cobra Competitions are, this one is worth an estimated $2.5 million. Few cars get anywhere near that kind of value, so even for Jay Leno it’s a bit pricey. He remarks about how driving it on the street might not be a great idea since, as you know, even if you’re being careful it only takes another driver not paying attention to cause an accident.</p>
<p>This one has been raced but is a little more street-oriented with tamer mufflers. However, it still has its factory equipment like the original 4-speed manual transmission. It’s a beautiful machine and we’re glad it didn’t fall victim to the fires.</p>
<p>Leno talks about how “raw” the Cobra 427 Competition is while driving it. The thing sure sounds raw and we can only imagine what it’s like behind wheel. After all, there aren’t many assistance features onboard, and we’re not talking about the more modern things like ABS and traction control. If you want a pure driving experience, something like this will serve it up unapologetically.</p>
<p>With the novel coronavirus lockdowns in California, you might notice videos like this one just feature Leno with the car and no guest on camera. Some people find it to be a welcome change of pace, because it’s just a gearhead talking about an interesting vehicle, not making small talk with someone else. What do you think? Should Jay Leno’s Garage keep doing this even after the shutdowns end?</p>
