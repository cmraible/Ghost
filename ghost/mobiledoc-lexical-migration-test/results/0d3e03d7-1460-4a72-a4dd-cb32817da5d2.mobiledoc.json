          " is hoping that a blog post – and four images from 1966 – can help uncover information on this mid-engine Mustang prototype. Five years ago, these images taken on May 2, 1966 surfaced showing a two-seater, mid-engine sports car in the design studio with no other information. After talking to numerous Ford executives and historians, all that seems to be known about this prototype is that it has nothing to do with the Ford Mustang Mach 2 Concept that was introduced at the 1967 Chicago Auto Show."

The Mustang's signature rear fenders are obvious, but the rest of the body is missing. The sloped nose and full-width chrome bumper give prototype a Corvette-like appearance, and other photos show the engine positioned just behind the front seats with a spare tire also situated in the trunk area."
