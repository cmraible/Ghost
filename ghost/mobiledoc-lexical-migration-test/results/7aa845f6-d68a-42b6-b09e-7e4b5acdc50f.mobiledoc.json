According to the local report, some residents say over half the cars parked on their street have been stolen and dumped. Some are missing parts, windows, etc. and the city isn’t doing much to clean them up."

Fed up the city wouldn’t get rid of it, this person covered part of the vehicle with brown paper. On that paper they wrote messages to shame city management, like “inept city of Oakland won’t tow me!” Shaming the city apparently worked, because the Mercedes was towed after that."

          "Part of the problem is that in Oakland, a police officer has to be present for a vehicle to be towed. Considering all the violent crime Oakland Police has to deal with, combined with the fact they’re understaffed (how did that happen?) means it can take a while for an officer to be available to perform this less-urgent task. In the meantime, the car thieves are working overtime, their plunders piling up along the roads."

          "To get all the stolen cars towed faster, the city is shifting the responsibility of having abandoned vehicles towed to Oakland Department of Transportation. However, there are some cars which look abandoned but are in fact habitats for the homeless, meaning the city will not remove those vehicles. That’s right, in the city of Oakland, California you can live in your car and park it in a legal spot indefinitely. Just remember, if you do that someone might steal your home, because car theft is really hot there."
