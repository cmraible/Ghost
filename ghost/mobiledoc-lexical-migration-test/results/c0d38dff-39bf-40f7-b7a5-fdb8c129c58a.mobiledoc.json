I changed from the Jubilee Line at Heron Quays, and was immediately struck by how much more aesthetically pleasing Canary Wharf has become since the towers proliferated.\n\nJust for a moment, I felt I was looking up at a film backdrop, not a real view at all. And that pleased me.\n\nTechnorati Tags: [architecture](http://www.technorati.com/tag/architecture), [buildings](http://www.technorati.com/tag/buildings), [canary wharf](http://www.technorati.com/tag/canary wharf), [london](http://www.technorati.com/tag/london), [property](http://www.technorati.com/tag/property)\n\n\n"
