<p>Lovingly called The Grinch for obvious reasons, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-chevrolet-camaro/">1970 Chevrolet Camaro</a> custom built by the good folks at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-1948-cadillac-madam-v/">Ringbrothers</a> is now heading to auction. You might recall this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/elegant-cougar-ringbrothers/">muscle car</a> from about a year ago when it was making its rounds through the automotive media, since it’s such an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-k5-blazer/">impressive build</a> created for none other than SEMA. Even though it’s being auctioned at no reserve during the Barrett-Jackson Las Vegas event in the middle of the month, we don’t expect it will go for cheap. Instead, this Camaro should command <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/restomod-1956-ford-f100/">quite the winning bid</a> since there’s nothing else just like it out there.</p>
<blockquote><em>See which Ringbrothers builds are our favorites <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-builds/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Ringbrothers is known for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ringbrothers-defector-hellephant/">going big on power</a> and not just looks, and we’re happy to report The Grinch is no exception. Ditching the factory mill from the Camaro, a Wegner Motorsports LS3 V8 with 602-horsepower on tap makes for plenty of fun. The intake manifold has been customized so it draws air from the cowl, plus there’s a Bowler TKO Tremec 5-speed manual and Detroit Speed Ford 9-inch rear with posi-traction to round things out. Topping it all off is a Flowmaster exhaust, which terminates at the rear valance, which was custom-fabricated by Ringbrothers.</p>

<p>When it comes to cosmetic details, Ringbrothers always knock it out of the park. From the shop’s custom badges, which include a stylized Grinch hood ornament, to the grille, exposed carbon-fiber side mirror caps, trunk-lid spoiler, and so much more, they absolutely wow the eyes. And of course, there are many custom aluminum parts all over the exterior, interior, and under the hood. Satin green paint with black accents pull everything together.</p>

<p>Speaking of the interior, it’s a one-off job by the Recovery Room, which used dark gray Italian leather with Corbeau seats, plus BMW carpet, and Classic Instruments gauges. If that’s not posh enough, the custom MTX Kenwood sound system kicks things up another notch.</p>
