In addition to views of the paint booth and the engine and body assembly, this video shows assembly of the smaller parts including the carburetors, speedometer and steering column. At the beginning of the video, workers can be seen hand torching an A-pillar, and we can't help but notice the lack of protective gear as the workers hand spray the body as it moves down the assembly line."

This year was the first for the Impala to get distinct taillights with three lighting elements while the Bel Air and Biscayne only had two lights. This design trend lasted until 1976.  "
