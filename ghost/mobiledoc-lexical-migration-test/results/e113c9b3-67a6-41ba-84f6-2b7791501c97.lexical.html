<p>The rise in popularity of the late 1980s Buick body style has been evident over the last two years. While <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/turbo-lover-460-mile-1987-buick-gnx/">the GNX trim line</a> is definitely king, any <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1987-buick-grand-national/">1987 Buick Grand National</a> has collectors scrambling to make room for it in their garage. This example from is a perfect representation of the model and shows just why these cars have had a second coming.</p>

<p>First off, this is not any ordinary example of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-buick-grand-national/">Buick Grand National</a> - this is an extremely low mileage vehicle with only 38,706 miles clocked on the car. This car is very ‘factory’ in every way, finished in the original black paint with Gray Velour interior, and rolling in perfect condition - to be clear, this is not a restored car, this Buick has just been so well preserved by its owners that it looks that way.</p>

<p>While not the GNX, this Grand National is powered by a turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 engine with Sequential Multi-Port Fuel Injection. Backing the engine is the original TH200-4R automatic four-speed transmission. Not only does it come with a powerful powertrain, it’s also fully loaded with options like air conditioning, power steering and power brakes, power windows, power seats, cruise control, power locks, a factory concert stereo, and a power antenna.</p>
