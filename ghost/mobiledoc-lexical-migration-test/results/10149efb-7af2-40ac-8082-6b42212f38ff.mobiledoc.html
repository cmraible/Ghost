<p>All the best people — and you, my friends, are clearly the <em>best</em> people — like to spend their weekends catching up on digital cultural trends. </p>
<p>So, here's some exquisitely curated links from the last few weeks to deepen your understanding of the cultural zeitgeist this fine weekend. </p>
<h2 id="people-doing-serious-things-on-tiktok-shocker">People doing serious things on TikTok shocker</h2>
<p>So, <em>gasp</em>, TikTok is being used for <em>serious</em> things. Yes, people are doing actual useful, in-depth content there. Gosh, this is <em>so</em> surprising, isn't it?</p>

<p>No, of course it's not. This <em>always</em> happens. Twitter was just for people talking about their lunch, Instagram was for photos of people's lunch… We start off trivialising a social media service, and end up <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">accusing it of destroying democracy</a>. TikTok is just on the same trajectory as every other service over the past two decades. </p>

<h2 id="facebook-kills-its-podcasting-support">Facebook kills its podcasting support</h2>
<p>This is also so unsurprising that it almost hurts. Podcasting becomes big, Facebook adds some half-hearted support, just in case it turns out to be a threat. It doesn't meaningfully build engagement, and podcasting generally hasn't proved a threat to Meta's business.</p>
<p>The plug gets pulled.</p>
<p>This is the future awaiting Facebook's <a href="https://www.bulletin.com">newsletter initiative Bulletin</a>, too. </p>

<h2 id="some-nuance-on-youtube-radicalisation">Some nuance on YouTube radicalisation</h2>
<p>Interesting piece from a <em>NYT</em> email, pointing out that the YouTube radicalisation spiral has been exaggerated. If you start searching for extremist content, you'll get shown more of it. If you're just watching cute cat videos, you're unlikely to ever see it. </p>
<p>So, it tends to push people already on a radicalisation journey further along the path, but it doesn't start them on that journey. </p>

<h2 id="never-underestimate-the-trades">Never underestimate the trades</h2>
<p>Remember the huge Post Office IT scandal? (If the answer's “no”, the BBC has a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56718036">good explainer for you</a>.) The story was actually broken years before it came to wider notice. It was in the pages of <em>Computer Weekly, </em>and the young journalist who broke it was Rebecca Thompson. And the nationals completely failed to pick it up until years later.</p>
<p>There's a horrible snobbery in journalism about anything that doesn't come from the nationals — or, at a pinch, the consumer mags — but sometimes B2B titles do some of the most important reporting. This <em>Times</em> profile of Rebecca (whom I was working with back when she broke the story) is a reminder that there's talent and great stories in <strong>all</strong> parts of journalism:</p>

<h2 id="the-sweet-seduction-of-seo-myths">The sweet seduction of SEO myths</h2>
<p>This is here as a reminder to myself more than anything. There are so many SEO myths sloshing around out there, with little or no evidence to back them up, and no clear source, but endless SEO blog linking to the same few unsourced, unproven statements. </p>
<p>I'm deep in a couple of SEO consulting projects right now: this is a great warning to make sure what I do is based on experimentation and evidence. </p>

<h2 id="and-finally-karl-lagerfelds-dated-ipods">And finally: Karl Lagerfeld's dated iPods</h2>
<p>Nearly 11 years ago, I was at the long-gone LeWeb conference in Paris. I live-blogged a talk by, of all people, Karl Lagerfeld, who talked about his use of iPads in his work:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="__GHOST_URL__/2011/12/le_web_karl_lagerfeld/">
        <div class="kg-bookmark-content">
            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Le Web: Karl Lagerfeld on iPads and technology</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">It’s a surprise to have a tech conference kicking off with an icon of fashion. But Karl Lagerfeld has some surprises for us. He sees himself as very “different from the marionette he has become for the rest of the world”. Despite being a self-proclaimed “paper freak” when it</div>

    </a></figure>
<p>But there was one interesting little revelation:</p>
<blockquote>He has hundreds of iPods with different compilations of music he creates, and he annotates them with the date so he can go back to a particular period.</blockquote>
<p>Well, Lagerfeld has since passed away, and now those iPods are <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/karl-karl-lagerfelds-estate-iii-evening-sale/a-lot-of-fifty-ipods-7th-generation-apple">up for auction</a>. And, sure enough, they're dated:</p>
