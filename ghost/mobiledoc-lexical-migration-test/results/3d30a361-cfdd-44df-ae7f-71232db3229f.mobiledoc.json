This is why the GTX became known as a “gentleman’s” muscle car. Don’t be fooled, because it’s still a legitimate performer, even with extra sound deadening. Today, the GTX has been recognized for what it always was, with values to match the reputation. There’s also little doubt that as time marches on, well-kept examples like this one will continue to appreciate, as well as turn plenty of heads."
