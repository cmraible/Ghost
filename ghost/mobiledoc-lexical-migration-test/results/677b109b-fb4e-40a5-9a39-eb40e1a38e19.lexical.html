<h4 id="stuff-i%E2%80%99m-reading"><strong>Stuff I’m reading:</strong></h4>
<p>• <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162163/republicans-anti-riot-laws-cars"><strong>The Right to Crash Cars Into People</strong></a> (New Republic) — <em>In 2017, “a 20-year-old neo-Nazi named James Alex Fields Jr. deliberately drove a Dodge Challenger into a crowd of people counterprotesting the ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fields injured scores of people and killed a woman named Heather Heyer. The obvious and immediate response to this intentional attack was nearly universal shock and horror. Fields was charged with murder and convicted. But since just before that attack, and even more so after it, Republican elected officials across the country have been trying to make it easier for certain people to run over certain other people.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/big-banks-charged-billions-in-overdraft-fees-during-pandemic/"><strong>Big Banks Charged Billions in Overdraft Fees During Pandemic</strong></a><strong></strong>(American Prospect)<strong> — <em>“</em><em>One of the more unheralded profit centers that has driven that (financial industry) money train is the return of overdraft fees. In the last three months of 2020, 12 of the 15 largest American banks, all of them with consumer-facing banking operations, reaped huge revenue just from slapping overdraft fees on needy and vulnerable Americans during the very worst days of the pandemic.”</em></strong></p>
<p>• <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/blah-blah-blah-the-lack-of-small-talk-is-breaking-our-brains/"><strong>Blah Blah Blah: The Lack of Small Talk Is Breaking Our Brains</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Walrus) — <em>“It’s no wonder that, more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, so many of us feel detached and disoriented. In the world of quarantine and remote work, one in which we’ve been robbed of opportunities to gather publicly, most conversation has been replaced by emails, texts, and an endless queue of scheduled calls. The pandemic has revealed how fleeting those transient interactions really are. And, as our circles shrink and isolation reigns, the absence of small talk may be harming us much more than we know.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/23/new-mexico-big-oil-gas-industry"><strong>New Mexico Fights To Escape Powerful Grip Of Big Oil And Gas</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“For the last decade, the oil and gas industry’s influence has only grown in New Mexico, one of the top oil and gas producers in the US. The sector has promised good-paying jobs and economic growth, all while consistently damaging the environment and burdening minority communities with pollution. It has managed to maintain this stranglehold by staying intricately involved in state politics.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://prospect.org/education/education-department-slow-walk-on-student-debt/"><strong>The Education Department’s Slow-Walk on Student Debt</strong></a> (American Prospect) — <em>“The debate over $1.7 trillion in student debt has focused mostly on <a href="https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/cancel-student-debt-dept-education/"><em>mass cancellation</em></a>, and Joe Biden’s reluctance to offer it. But underneath that, millions of borrowers are legally entitled to assistance that has not been forthcoming from the new regime. These measures, low-hanging fruit that could begin to ameliorate the student debt crisis, particularly for low-income people and people of color, have mostly not been taken.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/despite-climate-commitments-health-concerns-states-approve-giant-fuel-tanks-0325"><strong>Despite Climate And Health Concerns, States Approve Fuel Tanks</strong></a> (Capital & Main) — <em>“Governors in California, New Jersey, Louisiana and Colorado have laid out ambitious timetables for ramping down climate emissions, with each demanding a plan to reduce them by at least 80 percent by 2050. Yet in these same states, oil companies are being granted approval for projects that will tie their financial success to fossil fuel production for decades to come.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/03/governors-left-candidates-socialists"><strong>The Left Needs to Run Candidates for Governor</strong></a> (Jacobin) — <em>“The Left needs to start dreaming of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezes and Jamaal Bowmans in governors’ mansions, lording over legislatures and doing the work to make their own states hubs of ambitious leftist policies. Governors control tens of billions of dollars; a different governor in New York could have enacted a single-payer health care plan for the state by now. Leftists in power can grow the influence of unions, pursue innovative public transportation projects, erect far more permanently and deeply affordable housing, and tax the rich aggressively to pay for it.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsiSl1T7Mk8"><strong>Why Are Democrats Proposing A Massive Tax Cut For The Rich?</strong></a> (Rising) — <em>I appeared on Rising to discuss The Daily Poster’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly/"><em>reporting</em></a> on the proposed SALT cap repeal.</em></p>

<p><em></em><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></p>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Thanks to your support, we’re on the verge of a being able to implement an expansion plan here at <em>The Daily Poster</em>. I can’t wait to tell you all the details soon, but just know that we have been working for months on this expansion, and we’re thisclose to making it happen.</p>
<p>We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of this project — and I am more convinced than ever that the future of journalism is this grassroots-funded model that you are helping build.</p>
<p>Take a look at just some of the big stories we’ve broken open in the last few weeks. We <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-mocks-sanders-15-wage-bill/">exposed</a> senators helping corporate lobbyists try to stop a $15 minimum wage. We <a href="__GHOST_URL__/health-insurer-pressured-employees/">spotlighted</a> a health insurance giant’s schemes to block lower health insurance premiums. We’ve <a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-benefited-from-bidens-inaction/">showed how</a> the president is saying nice things about unions, but refusing to deliver on his promised initiative to stop union busting.</p>
<p>These stories were all uncovered by our own original reporting, and major media outlets are picking up and amplifying our coverage. The <em>Washington Post’s</em> top political reporter recently <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1359225670409342982">said</a>: “<em>The Daily Poster</em> became a must-read in a hurry.”</p>
<p>The point here is that we now have proof of concept — our first year has proven that a reader-supported independent news outlet can do accountability journalism that makes a real-world impact. And we’ve proven that along with our original reporting, we can offer live chats, podcasts and our new movie club that so many of you have said you want.</p>
<p>Now our challenge is to grow this model, fund more journalism and make even more of an impact.</p>
<p>Your support is responsible for all the impact we made last year — and your continued support is crucial for our expansion. So let me say again: Thank you for being part of our team. We couldn’t do any of this without you.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
