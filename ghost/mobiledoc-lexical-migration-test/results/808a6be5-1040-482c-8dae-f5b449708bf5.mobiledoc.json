There’s an option to purchase it and store the coupe in Japan until then, which would keep you from paying even more for a similar S15 Silvia in four years. Enthusiasts in Japan, Canada, and other countries lucky enough to have this car already agree it’s the best Silvia ever made by Nissan. It’s also the last generation. This particular S15 has some modifications, like an upgraded turbo, intercooler, intake, exhaust, and front strut brace. It would make for an excellent drift car or just something cool to take out on the weekends, especially for the price."
