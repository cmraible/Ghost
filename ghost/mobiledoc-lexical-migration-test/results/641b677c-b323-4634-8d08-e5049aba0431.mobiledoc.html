<hr>
<p>There’s a long-standing argument in the automotive world about whether performance cars which have been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2000-hp-chevy-apache/">built up from something more mundane</a> or were bought <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/youtuber-drives-supercars/">already posting crazy specs</a> are best. Enthusiasts can get really heated about their viewpoint on this disagreement, especially when you add in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/factory-five-33-ford-hot-rod/">kit cars</a>, which can be completely built by the owner. We’re not getting into that aspect in this article since <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-block-hoonifox/">Ken Block’s Hoonicorn</a> was made using a Fox Body Mustang.</p>
<p>However, let’s be honest: there’s little that’s original about this muscle car. With a mean twin-turbo setup you can see protruding from the hood and a 410ci Roush Yates V8, this little pony is pushing a mighty 1,400-horsepower. It also has all-wheel drive, which can be a huge advantage when launching. However, the Hoonicorn is no drag racer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are few cars which can hold a candle to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/gordon-ramsays-car-collection/">McLaren Senna</a>. It was built from the ground-up to be extreme and is the most track-focused road-legal car the British automaker has ever released. The best minds from the company were dedicated to making this the ultimate tribute to one of the greatest racers ever, whose name it bears.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the Senna has a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 with 789-hp and 590 lb.-ft. of torque. While it sounds like it’s outgunned by the Hoonicorn, the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission helps it rocket from 0-62 in 2.8 seconds and 0-124 in 6.8 seconds. In other words, this hypercar should absolutely destroy just about anything in the quarter mile, which McLaren claims is completed by the Senna in 10 seconds flat.</p>
<p>What’s even more epic about the video you’re about to watch is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-block-fox-body-daughter/">Ken Block</a> himself pilots the Hoonicorn. It eliminates the argument that the driver isn’t skilled enough to handle the car, because nobody knows it better than Block.</p>
<p>Which vehicle do you think will win this race? Watch to find out.</p>
