We don’t see many recreations of that iconic movie car, but it seems like just about everyone wants to build a version of the modern Eleanor. Now with the pathway opened up, we might be seeing a whole lot more of them, as if there weren’t already enough out there."

That’s when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California ruled that Halicki’s copyright claim was valid. What wasn’t settled in that case was whether or not a modified car can legally be considered a fictional character."
