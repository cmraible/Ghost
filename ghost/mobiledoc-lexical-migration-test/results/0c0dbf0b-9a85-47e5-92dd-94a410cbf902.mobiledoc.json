Trinen had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Right now they’re focused very much on getting the game ready. We have a few other things to talk about down the road between now and when it launches in December. We’ll hopefully have some news on that as we get closer to launch.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Following this question, IGN also asked about potential DLC for the game, to which Trinen responded with:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Obviously that was a big part of the Wii U game, but part of Mr. Sakurai’s approach is really focusing on getting the game done, and then once he has the game done, he’ll start to make some decisions about what he want to do. …with other characters or DLC, things like that. Whether or not he decides to do DLC again, or whether or not he decides this is the ultimate edition and there’s nothing more I can fit in there. We’ll have to see as we get closer to launch.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Are you hoping for a Super Smash Bros Ultimate demo? What about future DLC?
