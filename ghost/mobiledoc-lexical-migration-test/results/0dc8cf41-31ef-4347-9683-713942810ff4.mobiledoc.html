<p>Hello and welcome to our walkthrough of the Pikuniku Adventure Mode! Whilst this game is quite linear, there are still some moments and puzzles that may leave you scratching your head. So, let’s get into it…</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Wake up</h3>
<p>Ok, I don’t think I’m going to need to explain the tutorial for you, so just make your way through it and get out of the cave.</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Where are you?</h3>

<p>When you get out of the cave, make your way to the far right. Try to cross the bridge and it will collapse under you.</p>

You’ll come up to some villagers who will call you the beast and lock you in a cage. They agree to let you out on the condition that you help them repair the bridge.</p>

<p>Head back to the bridge that we had previously broke and kick the tree just to the left of it…</p>

<p>With that, a spider will fall down from a web. Kick the spider to the right and it’ll fly over to the other side, making a bridge made from the web. Cross the bridge and head back to the village.</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Go talk to the painter</h3>

<p>To find the painter, jump onto this house and then up the platforms to the apple tree.</p>

<p>Head left a little bit and jump onto the umbrella. This will send you upwards, so land on the floating island to the right and enter the house with paint all over it.</p>

<p>Enter the house and speak to the painter. He’ll explain that he has lost his pencil. So naturally, we need it get it back.</p>

<h3>Main Objective: Find the pencil hat</h3>

<p>Still inside the painter’s house, make your way to the right and down the stairs. Here, we’ll need to stack the two boxes on top of each other so that we can jump from on top of them in order to get up to the left ledge where the pencil hat is. To do this, we’ll need to move the left block over to where the right block is. Then walk to the right and kick the button so that the blocks falls on top of the other and they stack.</p>

<p>Now you can grab the pencil hat! Once you’ve done that, speak to the painter. Follow his instructions and equip your new hat. With the hat on, interact with the easel and draw a scarecrow face (or anything you want, really). Here was mine…</p>

<p>Now that you have the face, head outside and make your way to the left. Go past the wheel, past the cornfield, past the bridge and use this mushroom shown below to <em>boing </em>your way up to the platform where the friendly scarecrow is…</p>

<p>Put the new face on the scarecrow and watch some plot points unfold. Once that’s done, make your way to the right and watch some more plot moments. Now you can more freely explore the world and collect coins. But to continue with the plot, make your way to the far-right and you can now cross the chasm by using the lift.</p>

<p>Continue to the right and you’ll enter a brand new area.</p>
<h3>Main Objective: Explore the world</h3>
<p>Make your way to the right and use the grappling rings on the floating platforms to swing your way up.</p>

<p>You’ll want to keep swinging to the right until you’re up to the platform pictured below. Here, kick the big boulder and let it fall down.</p>

<p>Now jump on top of the boulder and use it get over the big obstacle. Continue to the right until you get to the big wall. Do you see the zigzags in the wall at the bottom? Those zigzags mean that you can walk through them and reveal hidden and secret areas.</p>
