That’s way more than a stock 2014 GT makes, and that amazing performance is celebrated on the side graphics for all to see. A six-speed manual with a short throw shifter helps you get through the gears quickly for truly rocking performance. There’s also a Borla exhaust to add that aggressive snarl everyone loves to hear, especially in tunnels."

Punching it up further are the body-color quarter window louvres and “Hulk” printed in the same color in big block letters on the tire sidewalls. Under the hood you’ll find green hoses and components painted to match the body. The black leather interior even features green accents on the door panels and seats, plus green accent stitching."
