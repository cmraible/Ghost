They share a small, but important space in the hearts of enthusiasts, and we’ve been keeping an eye out for a few good examples for our readers to check out. Recently, we noticed a set in a Silverstone Motorcars newsletter that caught our eye, and we’re wondering, which of these would you add to your collection? Check them out."

Finished in White with its original Red and Black Vinyl Interior, this sleek convertible will impress with the top up or down. It needs mechanical work and few things like the windshield, so it will make one interesting project car. See it "
