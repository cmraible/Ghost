After ten long years of sitting, “Brewser” got an update in 2009 by the hands of Rhine Enterprise in Denver, North Carolina. This refurbishment included a Hendrick 358ci V8 mated to a 4-speed manual, the car has also been fitted with all of the necessary components for hitting the short-track or road courses. That monstrous 358ci V8 has been equipped with a Holley 830-CFM NASCAR carburetor, "

As previously stated, Ray Evernham has secured himself as the rightful owner of this integral piece of NASCAR history. Although the car may not be officially competing in NASCAR races anymore, due to the recent banning, it is still exciting to think about what the future may hold in store for this car. Both Jeff Gordon and Ray Evernham are legendary names in the automotive and Nascar worlds, and the recent news of the reuniting of the car and one of its previous companions makes this a heart-warming and interesting story."
