In fact, there’s a good group of people who believe GM should’ve wedged a V8 into the little roadster, along with the Pontiac Solstice. There are even kits to do just that. As you know by now, this car doesn’t take that route at all. Instead, it has a 2JZ inline-six donated from a Toyota Supra, making for a wonderful American-Japanese mix you might not have ever considered."

Part of the reason why it’s so popular is the Toyota powerplant isn’t overly large, plus it takes to modifications extremely well, thanks to its overbuilt design."

Although if you were to hear it running the cat is out of the bag. The idea to use a 2JZ came from the Saturn owner connecting with a guy in Canada through Facebook who had done it. Thanks to the power of the internet he learned how to take on the exotic project and the rest is history."
