<p>While Mitt Romney is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-judiciary-committee.html">lauded</a> for joining fellow Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in supporting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the pro-business GOP senator likely isn’t too worried about his move having a major impact on the high court. Even if the Democrats succeed in getting their nominee onto the Supreme Court, the judiciary has already been so deeply indoctrinated it will still lean heavily in favor of corporate interests.</p>
<p>As <em>The Lever <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pro-business-law-and-economics-interests-pushed-the-courts-right/">recently reported</a></em>, researchers have found a link between sending judges to all-expenses-paid free-market trainings and right-wing business rulings.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHnoJrkMRI">our new video</a> about how the rise to the so-called “law and economics” free-market movement has pushed the courts to the right — and then use <a href="__GHOST_URL__/4-99monthly">this limited-time discount</a> to become a subscriber for <strong>less than $5</strong> to help us do more of the accountability journalism that corporate media continues to avoid.</p>
