<p>The group questions how it was possible for a major corporate studio like Disney to produce a movie about labor organizing in which police literally punch children in the face. They unpack how the film‚Äôs two main characters represent the dichotomy between labor ‚Äúactivists‚Äù and ‚Äúintellectuals.‚Äù And Harvey regales the group with additional historical context about the Gilded Age, the Bonus March, and the ‚Äúneoliberal turn‚Äù of the 1970s.</p>
<p>In addition, Rivka and Frank discuss the potential Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike over the rates of minimum basic agreements and streaming residuals ‚Äî and what it means for the future of film and television. The strike, which would include more than 10,000 writers and be the first such WGA action in 16 years, has the potential to shut down film and TV production nationwide.</p>
