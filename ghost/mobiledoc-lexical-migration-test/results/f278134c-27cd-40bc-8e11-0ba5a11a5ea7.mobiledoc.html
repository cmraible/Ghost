<p>In many ways the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/634/1995-mitsubishi-3000-gt">Mitsubishi 3000GT</a> was a revolutionary model for the automaker. It was introduced in 1991 and featured a sporty look that really caught the attention of the younger crowd. Although the aerodynamic and sleek body lines with multiple vents and attractive spoiler options gave the initial impression that the car could be a heavy contender in the up and coming JDM segment, the car was actually pretty weighed down and, as a base model, a bit under powered. </p>

<p>To keep up with the competition, twin-turbo and all-wheel-drive variants were put forward and the results were attention-getting to say the least. It was these features that really spoke for the car and soon garnered an enthusiast following. In 1994 the car was redesigned, which resulted in better lighting, a sportier look, and more power. Unfortunately <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/634/1995-mitsubishi-3000-gt">Mitsubishi pulled the 3000GT</a> from its lineup in 1999 leaving those that missed the opportunity to get behind the wheel disappointed.</p>

<p>Almost three decades later, <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/634/1995-mitsubishi-3000-gt">Raleigh Classic Cars is offering 3000GT</a> enthusiasts a second chance to own a 1995 example that is barely broken in. This all-original Glacier White Pearl <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/634/1995-mitsubishi-3000-gt">1995 Mitsubishi 3000GT</a> is currently under its second ownership and has only been driven 12,000 actual miles. It is one of just 9,149 produced in 1995, which doesnâ€™t really make it all that rare but the fact that it appears to be still in the same condition as when it rolled off the lot does. Under the hood, the original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1995-mitsubishi-3000gt-spyder-auction/">3000GT</a> 3.0-liter V6 engine and automatic transmission are running strong. </p>

<p>The black cloth interior, though true to the 90s, looks as though it has never been used and the car comes with the original spare and tools, which from the looks of it have also never been used. <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/634/1995-mitsubishi-3000-gt">Accompanying the vehicle</a> is the original owner's manual, books, and a clean CarFax report.</p>
