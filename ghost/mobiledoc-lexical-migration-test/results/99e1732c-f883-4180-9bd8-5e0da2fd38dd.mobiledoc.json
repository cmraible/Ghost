While many of these cars are red, black or silver, this 560SL is painted in a Midnight Blue paint job that is absolutely flawless â€“ no fading, scratches, door dings or rock chips. That includes the matching removable hard top, and the blue soft top is in great shape as well. This exterior is perfectly complemented by an all-gray interior that's in as excellent of a condition as the rest of the car."

Not only does this engine make the 560SL a perfect vehicle to cruise around in, it will also keep other sports cars honest as it has plenty of get up and go. As you might expect from a car with just one owner and such low mileage, this Mercedes is in near-original condition, and it has been properly maintained over the years with a list of new components to ensure this Mercedes will remain a confident cruiser."
