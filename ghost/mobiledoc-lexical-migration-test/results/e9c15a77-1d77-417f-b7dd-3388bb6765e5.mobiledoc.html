<p>This Cadillac Brougham Hearse has been slapped on a Chevy K10 chassis. That helps with capability to cross all kinds of terrain, along with a nice lift, meaty Mastercraft MXT tires, and steel side steps. The only drawback is you’ll have to raise the dead a little higher to load and unload them from the back.</p>

<p>Contrasting with the brutal vibe of this build are the 17-inch ION wheels. They match the chrome trim on the body quite nicely. Being a hearse of the 90s, the rear is covered in black vinyl for that appropriate element of mourning.</p>

<p>Providing stout power is a Chevy 5.7-liter V8. It works with an automatic transmission for easy cruising to your final destination, or maybe just down Main Street so people can gawk.</p>

<p>One upgrade is a modern AM/FM/CD head unit with touchscreen and Bluetooth. There are also provisions for a backup camera, because let’s face it, with a ride like this you’re going to need it. Speaking of the rear, not only do you get all the beautiful real wood trim back there, a coffin is also included, just in case there’s a problem with yours.</p>

<p>You could come up with a really fun name for this ride and customize it in different ways to play that up for even more wow factor.
