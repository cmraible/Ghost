<h3 id="the-limited-run-gallardo-lp550-2-black-editions-v10-exclusively-powers-its-rear-wheels">The limited-run Gallardo LP550-2 Black Edition's V10 exclusively powers its rear wheels.</h3>
<p>The Lamborghini Gallardo proved to be the Italian marque’s best selling car in its history. The baby bull provided a new entry-level machine for customers, and also a V10-powered answer to Ferrari’s F430. While some 14,000 Lamborghini Gallardos were built from 2003 - 2013, there were several very special edition models, this LP550-2 Black Edition listed by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/166347/2012-lamborghini-gallardo-lp-550-2-black-edition-coupe">Lamborghini Dallas</a> being one of them.</p>
<p>The typical Gallardo recipe involves that short wheelbase, a howling V10 engine, and all-wheel drive. However, a handful of purist special editions were launched with rear-wheel drive, a tradition Lamborghini broke with when introducing the Murcielago exclusively powered by all four wheels. The Gallardo Balboni, named after the marque’s illustrious test driver, was the first rear-driven model, but there was still demand for this more driver-focused specification long after the allocation had sold.</p>

<p>The LP550-2 Black Edition is a highly specified Gallardo finished in, you guessed it, black. The deep color coats the intricate alloy wheels, shades the lather interior, and covers the tweaked bodywork. This car is in prime condition and is specified with navigation, heated seats, and a transparent engine cover to show off that V10 motor.</p>

<p>Speaking of the powertrain, the 5.2-liter engine produces 550-horsepower that is sent exclusively to the rear wheels. A six-speed E-Gear automatic transmission takes care of cog-swapping as the supercar rapidly accelerates from 0-62mph in under 4 seconds.</p>
<p>Being rear-wheel drive makes this limited edition Lamborghini Gallardo 30kg lighter than its all-wheel drive equivalent. With less weight in the nose of the car, and the front wheels now only responsible for changes of direction, it’s a notably more agile machine.</p>
