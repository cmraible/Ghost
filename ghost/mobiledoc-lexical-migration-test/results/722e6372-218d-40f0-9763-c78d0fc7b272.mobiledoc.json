Not everyone is going to love the throwback looks of the concept car, which hearkens back to the Hyundai Pony Coupe Concept that debuted at the 1974 Turin Motor Show. If you’ve never heard of or seen that old concept, you might be laughing and rolling your eyes right now. For the Hyundai faithful it’s a bit of a unicorn, so to have a modern concept pay tribute to it is a big deal."

Even the Toyota Corolla is looking rather angry lately as designs one could easily associate with Ginsu knives have taken over. Sure, aerodynamic efficiency is important, but everything looking the same is getting really old."

This is done all the time in the industry. And when the concept never results in a production model, that usually means public reception was either cold or too mixed to encourage executives to greenlight anything."

That’s a huge challenge the brand has versus say BMW or Mercedes-Benz. But the fact is every brand has to start somewhere. The only question is will enthusiasts in this part of the world be interested in giving Hyundai a chance with something like the N Vision 74?"
