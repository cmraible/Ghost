<p><a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308394">In 1937, Ford</a> had a pretty good formula working for it. It pioneered in the American auto industry, and was making challengers do some serious work to keep up. The looks of the 1937 line got a lot more rounded than before, with convex hoods and side grilles wrapped around the nose. This year of the brand’s evolution is a notable one, and no proper Ford collection is complete without a show quality 1937 Ford in its presence. Examples like this <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308394">1937 Ford Custom Panel Truck</a> is a perfect candidate to bring home.</p>

<p>Ironically, the looks of <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308394">this panel truck</a> are set off by a color, courtesy of GM. It’s has GM’s code 418P Atomic Orange with a high shine clear coat. On the inside, you’ll find custom suede interior, black and tank custom dash, and more. Moving this custom truck is a 383 cubic inch White Performance 470-horsepower engine with 4bbl carb. The engine has aluminum heads, hydraulic roller cam, and forged pistons and rods. Backing the engine is a 4L601/700RH Transmission with 2400 stall speed torque converter.</p>
