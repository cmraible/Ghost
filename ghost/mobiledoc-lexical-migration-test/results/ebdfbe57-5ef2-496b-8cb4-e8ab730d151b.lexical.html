<hr>
<p>In 1982, the current owner of this <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/586/1969-pontiac-gto?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">1969 Pontiac GTO Convertible</a> got behind the wheel of his dream car. After nearly two decades of enjoying the car, he sold it to a friend who agreed to sell it back to him later on. Making good on that promise when it was time to move on from the classic Pontiac, the current owners friend resold the GTO to him in 2020. But now the current owner has decided that it is time to share this awesome car with another enthusiast that has an affection for one of Pontiac’s best muscle cars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/586/1969-pontiac-gto?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">All of the GTO’s</a> sheetmetal is also original and has absolutely no rust, although the car was repainted in its original Limelight Green color in 2004. A set of new Goodyear Eagle ST white letter tires have been installed on the original Rally II wheels and the 87,321-miles on the odometer are believed to be the actual miles. A custom car cover and a full service history since 1982 is included with the car.</p>
