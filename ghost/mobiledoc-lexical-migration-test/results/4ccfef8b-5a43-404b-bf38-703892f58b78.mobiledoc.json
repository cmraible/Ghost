To really leave other show cars green with envy, this 1960 Chevrolet Parkwood finishes off the look with green-tinted windows."

Despite the wheel tubs and a handful of other custom touches, the rest of this cabin looks surprisingly stock thanks to an impressive reupholstery using materials, patterns and even piping to match the look of the original interior."

That's thanks to the monster V8 under the hood that started with a 454 CI displacement and was stroked to 468 cubic inches. Add on the electronic fuel injection, performance heads, cam and MSD ignition, and this big block is cranking out 550 horsepower!"
