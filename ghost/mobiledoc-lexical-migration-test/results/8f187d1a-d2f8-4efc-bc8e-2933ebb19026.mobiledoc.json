As is usually the case with such a Frankenstein of an idea, Moen soon realized that using a camper wouldn't work, and even worse, the truck's factory chassis wouldn't be able to accommodate the added weight. So he went to work mounting the classic truck cab on top of a chassis from a 1985 motorhome and creating a custom-made shell for the living quarters, and because hot rodders can never have too much power, he swapped out the motorhome's original big-block gas V8 with a tuned 12-valve Cummins 5.9-liter turbo diesel engine pumping out 400 horsepower and 800 lb-ft of torque."

An air suspension system gives the Tourlienr its squatted stance, while the two-tone, black-and-tan paint job is both understated and eye-catching (who knew that was even possible?)."

Access to the one bedroom, one bathroom living area is possible through a cab pass-through or an exterior door, and here you'll find an interior that showcases birchwood with cherry trim and teak wood flooring."
