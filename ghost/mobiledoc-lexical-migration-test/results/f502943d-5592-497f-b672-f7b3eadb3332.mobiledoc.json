The vehicles on the auction block are a 1993 Ford Mustang Convertible 5.0 HO, 2001 Porsche Carrera 911 Coupe, 1971 Jaguar Type E Roadster, 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello, 1990 Ferrari 348TS, and 1990 Lotus E Spirit SE Coupe. From the photos they all look to be in at least pretty good condition, definitely worthy of being preserved, loved, and cherished by new owners."
