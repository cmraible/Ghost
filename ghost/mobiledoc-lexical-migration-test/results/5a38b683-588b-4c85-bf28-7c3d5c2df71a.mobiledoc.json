But Canonical’s failure doesn’t seem to be slowing down the efforts of <a href=\"http://jolla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jolla Oy</a>. The Finnish start-up comprised of former Nokia engineers is selling the Jolla, a new smartphone running on Sailfish OS, a Linux-based mobile operating system partially built on Nokia’s pre-Windows OS of choice, MeeGo.</p>\n<p>A post on <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-27/nokia-software-revived-in-challenge-to-android-as-jolla-debuts.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> from yesterday reports that Jolla has sold out of its first slate of handsets in Europe, and will roll out in the EU and China in 2014.</p>\n<p>In terms of hardware, the phone sounds like it’ll keep up pretty well with the rest of the smartphone pack out there. It features a 4.5-inch display, an 8 megapixel camera (with a 2 megapixel front-facing camera, for selfies, I assume), 16GB of internal storage and 1GB of RAM along with a MicroSD slot. Overall, it sounds like, well, a smartphone. The real draw, it seems, is the Sailfish OS, which looks slick and will work with just a few different kinds of swipes and gestures. Co-founder Marc Dillon is quoted as saying “We’ve made it very easy to move back and forth without having buttons. There are really only two simple gestures: pushing from the edge of the screen and pushing from the center of the screen.”</p>\n<p>Take a look at this promotional video showing off the Sailfish OS to see what he means:</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe title=\"Jolla - A new beginning (Official)\" width=\"1778\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfAixpkzcBQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And in order to bring people on board and compensate for the obvious lack of apps available for a new mobile OS, Jolla will apparently be compatible with Android’s slate of applications via emulation. If that bit of software jiu jitsu actually works, that would give the Jolla a huge edge in terms of winning over new hearts and minds.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the company isn’t interested in simply making phones that run a proprietary OS, like Apple and iOS. No, the Bloomberg post offers a comment from Jolla Oy cofounder Antti Saarnio who says that “Sailfish is a platform other players can drop their services on.” In short, Jolla Oy hopes to promote a new alternative to Android.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the phone or the operating system will ever make their way to the United States isn’t quite clear. And that isn’t the only question: can Jolla and its Sailfish OS actually rival Android and iOS? When a Goliath like Microsoft stumbles so hard, it might mean that only a small and nimble David could stand a chance at taking away Google and Apple’s mobile customers. But considering how similar Sailfish appears compared to the two most dominant mobile operating systems, I have my doubts about its chances to stand out. Let’s hope Jolla is able to prove me wrong.</p>\n"
