<p>Some people have never heard the phrase “snitches get stitches.” Sure, you should snitch if your buddy murders someone, but should you rat out a storied United States Air Force unit because they picked up a vintage motorcycle? Well, some people in Martha’s Vineyard, the swanky island community off the coast of Massachusetts, decided it was best to tattle on the Hurricane Hunters for that very reason. I can think of a term for such people, but I’m not allowed to use it.</p>

<p>Plenty of people noticed the large military aircraft which touched down at Martha’s Vineyard Airport. Some of those witnesses were in the Plane View Restaurant, with at least one sharing the experience on social media. Reportedly, the craft wasn’t on the ground long, dropping its ramp, then some people in “military-style clothing” pushing a vintage motorcycle one man swore was a BMW up the ramp before taking off. That all happened in a matter of 15 minutes, but it could get the crew grounded.</p>

<p>I’ll say it again: some people need to learn how to mind their own business. That’s asking for a lot, I know, but as a taxpayer I absolutely support the people keeping me safe collecting a cool old motorcycle. Or a muscle car. Or an off-roader. You get the point. And I’m not a fan of wasting taxpayer dollars, something politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. excel at. As far as I’m concerned, this was a better use of my money than Congress voting to yet again give themselves a huge pay raise. Have you seen their approval rating? Their pay should be tied to that.</p>
<p>Back to the Hurricane Hunters: there’s an official investigation going on right now. The result could be the loss or suspension of flight status for the crew. All thanks to those sweet people in Martha’s Vineyard not keeping their yappers shut. I hope they’re proud of themselves. They probably also yell at cashiers in the grocery store.</p>

<p>I’ve been following this story since it broke last month. At first there wasn’t much information, so I wanted to wait until more was known. But it’s also a fun story about what lengths enthusiasts will go to collect a beloved motorcycle.</p>
<p>In case you don’t know, the Hurricane Hunters come by their name rightfully. These badass Air Force members fly WC-130J aircraft, the Super Hercules, nearby and sometimes into storms. Equipped with meteorological data-gathering instruments, they gather vital information to help with predicting the path and severity of hurricanes and other weather patterns. Each plane is crewed by a minimum of five people. They are part of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, which belongs to the 403rd Wing based out of Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. The Hurricane Hunters have been proudly serving this nation since 1944 when they started tracking the weather in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Hurricane Hunters crew members involved in the unauthorized stop will be held accountable. They knew the risks before making the decision, but they did it anyway. Why? For the love of a vintage motorcycle, of course. Either you get it or you don’t. And I definitely do.</p>
