Nintendo has taken a positive direction with regards to making it easier for indie game developers to make games, and it shows!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: We are only listing titles that we have personally played as we do not believe in putting a game on a list that we have not personally experienced. Therefore, there may be a few notable exclusions (such as Limbo and Darkest Dungeon), but we will try our best to get to them and consider them for our future when we update the list in May. If there are any games that you believe should be a candidate for this list, please let us know by emailing us at team@switchaboo.com.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>90.

The last new game in the series was Monster World IV on April 1, 1994 and was only released in Japan. So despite Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap, a remake of the original that released on all current-gen consoles in 2017, fans have been craving a new entry – and now that wait is finally over. The game’s art style is beautiful and the classic concept of switching through monsters, each with their own unique abilities, is ingeniously implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to learn more about Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom, <a href=\"https://switchaboo.com/2018/12/04/monster-boy-and-the-cursed-kingdom-review-switch/\">click here to read our review.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n[su_button url=&#8221;https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Boy-Cursed-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B079RPT18N/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=nintendo%2Bswitch%2Bmonster%2Bboy&amp;qid=1554627683&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&#8243; target=&#8221;blank&#8221; background=&#8221;#f64201&#8243; size=&#8221;10&#8243; center=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_shadow=&#8221;0px 0px 0px #000000&#8243;]Buy Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom from Amazon[/su_button]\n\n\n\n<h3></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.
