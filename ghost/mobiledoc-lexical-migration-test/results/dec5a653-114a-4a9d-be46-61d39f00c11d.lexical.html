<p>An expert restoration that seems to have focused more on function than originality is only part of what makes <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/550/1936-ford-woody">this 1936 Woody station wagon</a> really special. It features a black finish that contrasts well with the natural finish of the mostly original wood and a black interior. Under the hood is a 1949 vintage 8BA flathead engine featuring Offenhauser finned heads, an intake manifold, and a pair of Stromberg 97 carburetors, mounted to a 3 speed manual transmission. A 12 volt electrical system and Juice brake system with front and rear hydraulic drum brakes adds a bit of a modern tough to an otherwise vintage masterpiece.</p>

<p>By the 1940s the Woody had progressed into more of a fashion statement than a structural design and none shows off the beauty of this transition better than this <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/668/1946-mercury-woody">1946 Mercury Woody Wagon</a>. It is finished in black over a fine brown upholstery and features many high end factory features such as a radio, a clock, and wheel beauty rings. This car is not just for show though, as it drives just as good as it looks.</p>
<p>Serious collectors should not miss this opportunity to pick up one of these fantastic Woodies for their collection but you don’t have to be a serious collector to enjoy the vintage style of a Woody Wagon. So, which one would you choose?</p>
