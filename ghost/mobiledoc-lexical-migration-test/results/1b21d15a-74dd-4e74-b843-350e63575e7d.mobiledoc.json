Nothing was ever official about Dodge re-entering competition after it exited with the close of the 2012 season. Still, the rumors about such a plan in the works has been making the rounds, especially since NASCAR brass has said they want a new OEM to participate. However, it looks like at least for now it’s not going to be Dodge."

The reason cited by Phelps was the pandemic, which has been blamed for all sorts of things. Despite that setback, Mopar fans have been hoping Dodge would be announced this time around, especially with the next generation of stock cars."

That helps explain why ticket prices will only cost your firstborn and a kidney. All joking aside, the growing popularity means more manufacturers want in."

There’s always the possibility of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, or Audi joining up for some Teutonic flair in the sport. Or bring in Jaguar and Bentley for some gentlemanly dignity. The possibilities are absolutely endless."
