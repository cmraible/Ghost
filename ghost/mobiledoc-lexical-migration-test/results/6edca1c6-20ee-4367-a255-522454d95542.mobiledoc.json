They also abhorred the engine cover, with some claiming it would cause the Black Prince to tip over when hit with crosswinds. However, this high-performance motorcycle helped pave the way for progress in the motorcycle world, and so it’s considered extremely important historically today."

At that time, the Black Prince was in major disrepair, so in its current state this Vincent is worth far more. As the world better understands the significance of this bike, it will surely increase in value further. Many that are still in existence sit in museums, and you could show this ride off with great pride at any show or gathering."
