Welcome to the 21st Century and how everything is becoming dumber. The suspects apparently rented a 2018 Tesla Model S so they could jump it at Baxter Street and Alvarado Street in the City of Angels."

You can hear a crash and the car tires screeching, then the group of bystanders who almost all appear to be holding cameras or phones to record the jump go over to the electric vehicle. A woman can be heard asking if they should call 911 and a man says it’s not necessary since nobody was hurt."

The Tesla hit a few trash cans, which somehow seems appropriate and not that big of a deal. Worse, it also struck two parked cars. Of course, like complete idiots, the people who were there to watch the even recorded it on their phones and posted it to social media, then put a bow on it for detectives."

It turned out to be a rental, so there’s paperwork about who paid for it and police are following up with that person. Somehow, we think these guys didn’t plan this “perfect crime” well at all. Who would’ve thought social media influencers could be so dumb?"

In fact, they received so many that they eventually asked everyone to stop submitting names. The official Twitter account stated “over 90%... are of the same person who has a TikTok handle of @dominykas or @durtedom on Twitter.” It later stated police are looking for witnesses who were at the scene to come forward. Some of the tips submitted indicated two Instagram users, @alex.Choi and @chazzydawg were there."

Hopefully there will be consequences to teach what parents obviously failed to communicate. However, since Los Angeles has decided to coddle criminals, likely these kids will get a slap on the wrist and they know it."
