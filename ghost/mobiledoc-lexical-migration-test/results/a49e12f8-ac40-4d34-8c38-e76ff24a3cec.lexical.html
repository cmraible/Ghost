<p>The third generation Plymouth Barracuda, which ran from 1970 to 1975, gets quite a lot of respect in muscle car and collector car circles. In our opinion, the first and <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">second generation cars</a> deserve more attention than they get.</p>
<p><a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This tastefully modified 1969 Barracuda</a> is a great example of the second generation. Like the first generation (1964-1966), the second generation (1967-1969) shared a lot of its underpinnings with the Valiant.</p>

<p>Three body styles were available – a fastback coupe, a convertible, and <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the hardtop coupe seen here</a>. We actually really like the lines of the hardtop body style. This one looks especially nice in an eye-catching shade of metallic sunburnt orange. </p>
<p>It's a color that would look great on nearly any Mopar muscle car, but <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">especially this one</a>. The Cragar wheels and white letter tires are the perfect complement to that stunning paint job.</p>

<p>It's an appropriately named color, too. Currently, <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Barracuda</a> resides in Delray Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>Like many Barracudas, <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this car</a> originally came equipped with slant six power. It's been treated to a 318 cubic inch V8 swap, backed up by what we assume is an A727 Torqeflite automatic.</p>
