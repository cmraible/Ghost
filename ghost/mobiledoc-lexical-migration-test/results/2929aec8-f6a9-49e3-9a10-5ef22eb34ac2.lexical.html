<p>As generations pass since the release of a vehicle, elements, and just time itself, can wear away on a car. Unless it's been kept in a bubble and never driven, most vehicles with some age on them tend to show it. Instead of tossing the car, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1969-camaro-rs-ss-vert/">restoring it</a> to its original condition <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/restomods-on-motorious/">(or better)</a> is the way to go. Whether a full-on concours restoration was completed, or a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1958-porsche-356a-speedster-auction/">daily driver grade restoration</a> was completed, here are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-cars-for-sale-on-motorious-coronapocalypse-edition/">some of the coolest</a> restored cars on Motorious.</p>

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1972-porsche-911s.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Fresh out of a CPR ground-up restoration, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/188197/1972-porsche-911s">this 'S' model 911</a> uniquely features alloy front brake calipers, Koni shock absorbers, front and rear anti-roll bars, and the 'S' exterior trim package. CPR stripped the car down to the bare metal tub and removed all paint and undercoating. It was then metal worked with lead, and the gaps set to beautiful factory-correct tolerances. From there, the car was sealed, epoxied, and undercoated and then refinished in factory-correct Metallic Silver Glasurit two-stage paint, per the Certificate of Authenticity.</p>
<h3 id="1963-cadillac-fleetwood">1963 Cadillac Fleetwood</h3>

<p>During the restoration <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194006/1963-cadillac-fleetwood-fully-restored">this Caddy</a> went through extensive and meticulous powder coating on all the bumper mounts and hardware, all the chrome was replated, the undercarriage was painted, windows tinted and it even received Big Bore power disc brakes on all 4 corners - the engine and transmission were professionally rebuilt in 2018. These cars came with a massive interior but the competition sound system was just added during the build. Featuring Rockford Fosgate Punch speakers in the cab, but elegantly hidden to retain that classic styling. Lift the trunk lid and find a fully custom trunk with Rockford Fosgate amps, and Rockford subs and custom LED lighting to go along with the carpeting and upholstery work.</p>
