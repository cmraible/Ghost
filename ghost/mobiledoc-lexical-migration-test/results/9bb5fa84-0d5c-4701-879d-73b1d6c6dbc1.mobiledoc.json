To clearly illustrate why you might want to think first before doing that burnout while departing from any event is this example of a classic Chevelle going out of control, crashing into a wall in the UK. Of course, there are countless other instances of people doing similar things, including Mustangs plowing into crowds and Mopars careening into oncoming traffic."

Even in the US a classic Chevelle like this with a nice big blower rising gloriously out of the hood will draw a crowd. However, in the UK such a muscle car is a rare beast, so people were really fascinated with it."
