            "text": " features a new take on the two world mechanic that many games have used in the past. Every level has two worlds, each with different geometry to navigate. The fresh twist on this mechanic, and most likely what inspired the title of the game, is the rift that splits the two worlds. Using the right stick, you can control the rift’s position, revealing more of one world while hiding the other. With the shoulder triggers, you can rotate the rift. This creates a gameplay experience that challenges your spatial awareness, your ability to carefully consider your next steps and your creativity with the utilization of the rift. Your character’s movement options are extremely limited, relegated to walking on flat surfaces and a very short, very shallow jump, so a lot of your vertical movement relies on the rift. There are a few methods to achieve this: one way is to position the rift horizontally close to the bottom of where a column would be and in the other world, placing your character on top of the column that is there and raising the rift - As the column comes into existence, your character is elevated until the rift passes the top of it; another way is to position the rift at a diagonal, cutting a column on a slant to make a ramp to walk up.

It’s a game that challenges you mentally by completely changing your perspective on two worlds and how to progress through them. However, the game is not without its flaws.

While not a flaw at all, those that look for a narrative element to their games will be disappointed by the game’s lack of story. All told, I think ",
