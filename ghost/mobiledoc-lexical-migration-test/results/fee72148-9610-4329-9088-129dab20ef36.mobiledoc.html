<h2 id="why-analytics-matter">Why Analytics Matter</h2>
<p>Use of analytics is one of the things that marks digital journalism out from its print cousin. We didn’t - and couldn’t - use analytics in print, because we had no good way of knowing who read what in print. As a result, we have no tradition of using figures about how our work is consumed to improve what we do.</p>
<p>This is an area where we can learn from digital-first journalism startups, which work metrics into their decision making and planning from the start. Having useful information about your audience’s interests - and the success or failure of your own instincts - are useful data points in understanding the effectiveness of our work.</p>
<p>While some organisations have done the simplistic route of merely measuring traffic figures in aggregate, smarter companies give access to their journalists so they can use live feedback to help inform their work. This course was designed to enable that form of decision-making - and I hope it did so for you.</p>
<p>The following notes contain the major points we discussed on the day, along with some useful links to further reading, if you should need it.</p>
<h3 id="some-words-of-caution">Some words of caution</h3>
<p>Analytics are at their best when you use them to <strong>inform</strong> your work, not to <strong>control</strong> it. Merely following the metrics will trap you into a circle of doing the best bits of what you do now better, rather than developing and experimenting. That’s a dangerous trap to fall into - at least as dangerous as working “blind”.</p>
<p>Bear this in mind:</p>
<p><em>Analytics is the beginning of wisdom, not the end of it.</em></p>
<p>You need to challenge, question and seek to understand what you see in analytics. If you see that a certain type of content isn’t working, for example, your first response shouldn’t necessarily be to just drop it. Ask yourself <em>why</em> it isn’t working, and then figure out how to correct that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are you selling the story wrong?</li>
    <li>Is your news judgement wrong?</li>
    <li>Is the storytelling format wrong?</li>
    <li>Is it being published at the wrong time of day?</li>
</ul>
<p>All these are avenues of exploration before you conclude that that form of content should be dropped.</p>
<p>Another idea to bear in mind:</p>
<p><em>Not everything that can be measured should be measured.</em></p>
<p>If you measure the wrong things, you might end up optimising your content for the wrong things - and that can create problems. Kevin Anderson expands on this idea in a recent <a href="http://charman-anderson.com/2015/06/19/content-metrics-arent-bad-measuring-the-wrong-things-is-bad/">post on metrics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="align-your-analytics-with-your-business-models">Align your analytics with your business models</h2>
<p>One clear solution to this is to make sure that your align your metrics with your site’s business model as clearly as you can. What role does your journalism play in the site making money? How can you check if you are succeeding in that?</p>
<p>For example, a site with a porous paywall may be paying attention to overall traffic figures - but that’s probably not the most useful thing to measure. If the site’s current goal is recruiting new subscribers, it’s more useful to measure what sorts of content attract new subscribers - and they to figure out how to do more of it - or get a bigger audience for what you’ve already got. Conversely, if the priority is keeping existing subscribers, you will get far more benefit from measuring subscriber use of the site than from general traffic metrics.</p>
<p>Sites monetised on general advertising may well just be interested in the hits.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Figure out what matters to your site</li>
    <li>Figure out how to measure it</li>
</ul>
