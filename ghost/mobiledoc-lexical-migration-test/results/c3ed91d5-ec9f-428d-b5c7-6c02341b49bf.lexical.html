<hr>
<p>There’s little doubt that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-chip-foose-work-on-his-1969-chevy-camaro-restomod/">Chip Foose</a> is a controversial figure in the automotive community. Some people absolutely fawn over every <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-custom-duesenberg-video/">design he pens</a> and car he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-c1-corvette/">customizes</a>. Others wretch in horror at what he’s done to classics, both on paper and in steel. And there are other people who like some of his creations but aren’t fans of others. We expect a mixed reaction to his latest venture: tweaking the DeLorean DMC-12.</p>
<p>We’ve seen Foose do quite a few revisions to classic car designs in the near past, including the first-generation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-toyota-mr2-fastback/">Toyota MR2</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-lamborghini-countach/">Lamborghini Countach</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-classic-mini-m3/">Mini</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-redesigns-the-first-gen-ford-bronco/">first-generation Ford Bronco</a>. Some people absolutely loved his fresh, unique approach to these cars while others didn’t.</p>
<p>As for the DeLorean DMC-12, a car popularized by the Back to the Future series, many feel its sacred ground not to be meddled with. Of course, some people have customized DeLoreans in real life and lived to tell the tale. But what kind of magic will Foose apply to it?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the man doesn’t paint the car some bright color. Despite kind of complaining about the plain stainless steel body, Foose leaves that element untouched. Instead, he goes after the front and rear ends of the car, areas he feels were awful and need some plastic surgery.</p>
<p>Before you start looking at Foose’s drawing like it’s some sort of weird work of Picasso, know he wasn’t going for a Cubist feel. As he explains in the video, he wanted to simultaneously give a side profile view as well as a 3/4 look the front and rear. Maybe he should’ve done 3 drawings?</p>
<p>Foose definitely made the front and rear end of the DeLorean less busy and more modern, but is the result better? That’s definitely a matter of opinion, so let us know what you think in the comments.</p>
