<p>Based on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1930-oldsmobile-displayed/">Oldsmobile</a> Cutlass and developed by Hurst to celebrate the 56th running of the Indianapolis 500, the 1972 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1973-oldsmobile-hurst-w30/">Hurst/Olds</a> was painted in Cameo White with gold decals, and these cars sported the W25 package that included the fiberglass ram air hood and the gold rally wheels. There were only 130 convertibles made to go along with 499 coupes (which includes 220 examples that came with a sunroof).</p>
<p>Although the listing makes no mention of a restoration, this car is in incredible shape considering its age and the fact that it has 102,000 miles. From the paint to the interior to the engine compartment, this car is as clean as can be, and it's definitely an award-winning car. Speaking of the engine compartment, the heart of the 1972 Hurst/Olds was Oldsmobile's monster 455 cubic-inch V8 paired to a Turbo Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission topped with a nifty Hurst dual-gate shifter ensuring this car is as fun to cruise in as it is to look at.</p>
<p>If you want a shot at owning a truly rare pace car from the end of the muscle car era, then be sure you're <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/193757/1972-oldsmobile-cutlass-hurst-olds/amp">registered to bid</a> on this impeccable 1972 Hurst/Olds Pace Car Convertible.</p>
