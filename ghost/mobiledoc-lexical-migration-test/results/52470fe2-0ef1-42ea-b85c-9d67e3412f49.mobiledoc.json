The C8 Corvette in question tried to drive through deeply rutted sand at the beach, getting hopelessly stuck. Why someone would try such a thing in a C8 Corvette, which has precious little ground clearance not to mention absolutely the wrong kind of tires for driving on sand is a mystery."

Really, it’s a stupid idea because that’s a great way to break some suspension components. That’s why you should have a tow hook in your car, which C8 owners claim aren’t included. Calling a professional tow company would have been worth the nominal charge, because this amateur way of pulling the sports car out of the sand looks to have done some damage."

You might think it’s embarrassing a truck would get stuck like that, but heavy vehicles aren’t ideal for driving on sand. Also, it’s clearly a two-wheel-drive model, as only the rear wheels are spinning uselessly in the sand instead of all four spinning uselessly."
