In order to make it a fun gaming experience, developers often rely on implementing arcade mechanics or quirks to make the gameplay a little spicey. Chuhai Labs's solution was the addition of Ace Cards which provide a variety of once-off mechanics. These include additional golf balls, exploding balls, the ability to stop a ball mid-flight and many more (I won't spoil the fun). You'll start off with a few cards but the better you do, the more you'll obtain."

However when you're taking your shot, you can only ever-so-slightly move the camera, which often leaves you guessing based on what you previously saw.
