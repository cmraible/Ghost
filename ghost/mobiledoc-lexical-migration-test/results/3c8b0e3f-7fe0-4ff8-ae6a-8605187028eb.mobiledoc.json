The violent wreck killed 19-year-old Shaundi Kyree Smallwood and injured two other passengers in the Lincoln. Abernathy, however, wasn’t reportedly injured. Instead, he was arrested and charged with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of manslaughter."

Too often, guys in performance cars go out looking to show other guys in performance cars what they can do while traveling urban highways. To race in such conditions, both drivers have to weave through the dense traffic constantly. It’s incredibly selfish and dangerous, but we personally have witnessed these kinds of situations more times than we can count."

That there are people who think because they have a Camaro they have the right to turn roadways into racetracks is just maddening. Nobody should be traveling 157 mph on a public road, especially one that’s crowded with traffic. At that speed, things happen quickly; the smallest wrong move can end tragically."
