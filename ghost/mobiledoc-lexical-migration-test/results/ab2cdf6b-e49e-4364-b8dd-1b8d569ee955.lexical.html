<p>As the Supreme Court lurches ever more to the right on issues like abortion rights, voting rights, and immigration, there has been little attention devoted to a key player who could have a hand in the shift: Ginni Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas. As exposed in a <em>New Yorker</em> article that we highlight below, Ginni is a far-right extremist who believes the country is under threat from “fascist left” and “transsexual fascists,” and works with dark money groups with deep ties to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court"><strong>Is Ginni Thomas a Threat to the Supreme Court?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) <em>— “In recent years, Justice Thomas, long one of the Court’s most reticent members, has been speaking up more in oral arguments. His wife, meanwhile, has become less publicly visible, but she has remained busy, aligning herself with many activists who have brought issues in front of the Court. She has been one of the directors of C.N.P. Action, a dark-money wing of the conservative pressure group the Council for National Policy. C.N.P. Action, behind closed doors, connects wealthy donors with some of the most radical right-wing figures in America. Ginni Thomas has also been on the advisory board of Turning Point USA, a pro-Trump student group, whose founder, Charlie Kirk, boasted of sending busloads of protesters to Washington on January 6th.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/united-states-health-care-system-national-health-service-corps"><strong>The U.S. Has a Homegrown Model For A Better Health Care System</strong></a> (Jacobin) <em>— “I applied for an NHSC scholarship because I saw the program as a way to deliver quality care to underserved patients, and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to serve in an organization whose mission actually aligned with my own values and beliefs: principally, that health care should be a public good. When I graduate in 2023, I will practice medicine among the largest cohort in the National Health Service Corps’ nearly fifty-year history.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/democrats-shape-up-bidens-presidency-trumpian-sequel"><strong>If The Democrats Don’t Shape Up, Biden’s Presidency Will Lead To A Trumpian Sequel</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Guardian) <em>— “This last year has felt a bit like being trapped in a nail-biting intermission between two horror films. The opening installment consisted of Donald Trump’s first four years in office — it ended with the cliffhanger of a deadly plague and a surreal, poorly executed, but still terrifying ransacking of the Capitol. The sequel practically writes itself, as the man ascends to power a second time, even more emboldened and determined to hold on to power.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/safeway-frontline-workers-coronavirus-safety-measures"><strong>A Year in the Life of Safeway 1048</strong></a> (In These Times) <em>— “The lives of grocery workers have continued as usual, but with an added dose of deadly risk. They never really signed up for it. Though less celebrated than nurses or paramedics, grocery workers are quintessential frontline workers — the ones who have kept showing up so the rest of us can survive. Like their counterparts across the country, the employees of Safeway 1048 have kept on working through a dangerous year. Their employer has given them mask policies, more cleaning in stores and a fleeting dose of hazard pay, but their lived experience has shown them the safety net has holes big enough to fall through. The experience has left many of them bitter.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://thebrick.house/former-alec-state-chair-joe-manchin-continues-to-do-the-groups-bidding/"><strong>Former ALEC State Chair Joe Manchin Continues to Do the Group’s Bidding</strong></a> (Brick House) <em>— “Manchin’s ties to ALEC go back to his rise in West Virginia, where he was elected governor in 2004 before winning a Senate special election in 2010. As a state senator in 1994, Manchin was ALEC’s West Virginia state chairman and an ALEC national director, as recorded in a conference brochure that also flatters him: ‘In addition to his lawmaking duties, Senator Manchin is a businessman and owner of Enersystems, a private company dealing with the natural resources of West Virginia.’”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/01/21/koch-missouri-senate-eric-greitens/"><strong>How The Leading Republican Candidate For Missouri Senate Seat Lost Koch Support</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Intercept) <em>— “After a couple of years out of the limelight, [Eric] Greitens is now trying to reenter politics, running for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Missouri Republican Roy Blunt. He’s portraying himself as a political witch hunt survivor like former President Donald Trump, dubiously claiming that he’s been fully exonerated… But this time, he’s lacking the support of many of the right-wing megadonors he once had. For some powerful Republicans, like talk show host Hugh Hewitt, he could be a vulnerability during the general election for what otherwise should be a safe red seat. ‘I’m afraid you’ll be Todd Akin 2.0,’ Hewitt said in a scathing interview with Greitens last March.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://defector.com/the-cold-war-killed-cannabis-as-we-knew-it-can-it-rise-again/"><strong>The Cold War Killed Cannabis As We Knew It. Can It Rise Again?</strong></a><strong></strong>(Defector) <em>— “America fought a war here. The Rastafari were the enemy because of the ganja. It was the ganja that embarrassed the Americans and the British before them, the plant that grew so bountifully that the farmers could trade it for guns to arm the people who fought for their island, against the people who had come to exploit it. Between 1975 and the present day, the country of Jamaica has seen immense population growth. An island of about 2 million people in 1975 holds nearly 3 million today. And yet during that time period, the Rastafari have declined in volume by tens of thousands. There are fewer of them now than there were then, despite an overall population growth of 50 percent. Migration patterns come and go, and it’s common to reduce the proportion of an ethnicity or group of people. But the volume should not reduce. The volume only reduces when something happens. When there is something to flee, or something that got you before you could flee.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/01/will-britain-survive/621095/"><strong>How Britain Falls Apart</strong></a> (The Atlantic) <em>— “The grim reality for Britain as it faces up to 2022 is that no other major power on Earth stands quite as close to its own dissolution. Given its recent record, perhaps this should not be a surprise. In the opening two decades of the 21st century, Britain has effectively lost two wars and seen its grand strategy collapse, first with the 2008 financial crisis, which blew up its social and economic settlement, and, then, in 2016, when the country chose to rip up its long-term foreign policy by leaving the European Union, achieving the rare feat of erecting an economic border with its largest trading partner and with a part of itself, Northern Ireland, while adding fuel to the fire of Scottish independence for good measure. And if this wasn’t enough, it then spectacularly failed in its response to the coronavirus pandemic, combining one of the worst death rates in the developed world with one of the worst economic recessions. Yet however extraordinary this run of events has been, it seems to me that Britain’s existential threat is not simply the result of poor governance — an undeniable reality — but of something much deeper: the manifestation of something close to a spiritual crisis.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/24/john-mellencamps-mortal-reckoning"><strong>John Mellencamp’s Mortal Reckoning</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “The musician, who comes from Indiana and began releasing records in the late nineteen-seventies, is known as a populist soothsayer, an irascible and unpretentious spokesman for hardworking, rural-born folks. Yet Mellencamp has also bristled at this characterization, which is largely rooted in fantasy… ‘Let’s address the ‘voice of the heartland’ thing,’ he told Paul Rees, whose satisfying biography, ‘Mellencamp,’ came out last year. ‘Indiana is a red state. And you’re looking at the most liberal motherfucker you know. I am for the total overthrow of the capitalist system. Let’s get all those motherfuckers out of here.’”</em></li>
