Same goes for the interior, where the only change is a new instrument cluster, but even that keeps with the vibe of the original pretty well. We’re always horrified to see people try to glam up Chevelles because it doesn’t play to the car’s strengths. This isn’t some fancy vehicle, but instead is a down-to-earth American muscle machine. That’s what makes it great and it’s wonderful to see this guy gets it."
