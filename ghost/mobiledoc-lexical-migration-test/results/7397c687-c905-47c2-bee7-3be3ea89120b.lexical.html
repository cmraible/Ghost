<p>Shredding tires in a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">car</a> is a ton of fun, but shredding tires while drifting around a turn is next level. That’s exactly what the 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Toyota/Supra">Toyota GR Supra</a> Papadakis Racing is building will be doing regularly. The build has required the team to essentially disassemble the entire car, which is brand new. It’s a fascinating process for anyone who wants to see what makes the new <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/toyota/supra/">Toyota Supra</a> tick. While the car will be pushing 1,033-horsepower using that factory <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/BMW">BMW</a> straight six, the project is far from over so we don’t get to see those results quite yet.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, there’s plenty of work involved in getting this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Toyota">Toyota</a>ready to compete on the track. After all, when dealing with a vehicle which hasn’t really been documented in depth by the aftermarket, Papadakis Racing is acting as a pioneer. Often, you at least can reference what others have done and maybe improve on that or tweak it to your needs, but in this case they’re going into this project fairly blind.</p>
<p>The team has already tuned the engine to 1,033-horsepower, which is impressive to say the least. I’m sure everyone wanting to tweak their Supra for street or track use could learn a thing or two from what they did. It won’t be working with the OE transmission, but instead will be bolted up to a four-speed racing transmission.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, because we’ll see the finished car soon enough. After all, it should be competing in this year’s Formula Drift season, which starts April 10. That means the pressure is on for Papadakis Racing to get everything buttoned up.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first drift car Papadakis has built. In fact, the team has been a big force in Formula Drift since 2004. Among its current builds is a Scion tC with a V8 engine and a Toyota Corolla Hatchback converted to rear-wheel drive and pushing 1,000-horsepower.</p>
