One chap commented on the anti-Banksy graffiti below, and I had a quick nosey at his pictures.\n\nWhat a find. Heâ€™s documenting the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza strip, with some powerful images already up-loaded. You can fine the whole lot [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/velvetart/sets/658376/).\n\n\n"
