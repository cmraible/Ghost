<p><a href="https://www.tapkat.org/shelby-american-automobile-club/y5Orb9?promo=MOTDEC">ERA #704</a> is a special build. It is finished in Deep Metallic Blue with competition white stripes. Additionally, it sports a hood scoop, thermal coated side pipes, chrome roll bar, competition Monza gas cap and bumper eliminating jack pads. Cobra Automotive came up with a compact version of the twin Paxton supercharger that would fit under the S/C hood scoop without having to add a massive hood scoop that would distract from the appeal of the Cobra.</p>
