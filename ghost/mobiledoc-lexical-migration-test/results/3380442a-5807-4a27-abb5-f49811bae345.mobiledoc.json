We get to watch from Trooper Robert Sanford’s dashcam as he aggressively charges through stopped traffic on the highway while punk kids do burnouts and donuts so their friends can record everything, posting it on social media to get likes and even monetize the criminal behavior."

Whatever it was, the trooper was able to PIT him twice, the second time also blocking the stopped Korean sport coupe with the much heavier sedan. Before too long, the kid is thrown in the backseat and looks like he should’ve worn the brown pants for the meeting with his online “friends.”"
