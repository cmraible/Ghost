          "The Buick Regal has been a significant player in the automotive performance industry since the 1980s because of models like the GNX and other custom classics whose time at the drag strip was unparalleled. Combining a sleek design with a hefty horsepower figure from an unlikely source, these Buick sports cars quickly earned the title of a muscle car. Nowadays, these vehicles are virtually unlike anything else on the automotive enthusiast market because of their seemingly endless potential for power. This particular vehicle is an excellent example of what someone can do with this platform, and even though its design is upsetting to some purists, we still think it's pretty cool."

          "On the outside, it may seem like an extraordinary racing-inspired Buick model made to defeat supercar times on the drag strip. For the most part, you would be correct in that assumption except for one big piece of the puzzle, which seems to make most car people a little uncomfortable. Rather than boasting the typical turbocharged V6 engine, this vehicle's engine bay is home to a massive 427 cubic inch LS V8 engine. A controversial choice, to be sure, this engine allows the car to produce well over 1000 horsepower and make some impressive passes at the local drag strip. So why would the owner of this car opt to swap out the old V6 motor for the current high-displacement engine?"

          "Simply put, because they wanted to, and it's their car, the purists don't have a stake to claim. The V6, which came in the original vehicle, was extraordinary, but it still had its limits due to the lower displacement and cylinder count. Another point in favor of the LS swap is the forced induction method, some people like turbocharging while others prefer supercharging or naturally aspirated. The V6 was made to work best with a turbocharger. At the same time, the LS platform is better enhanced via supercharging, which is precisely what the Magnuson supercharger takes full advantage of on this build. While it may be a controversial choice, it was likely the best option for this all-wheel-drive drag strip dominator and its owner's intentions."
