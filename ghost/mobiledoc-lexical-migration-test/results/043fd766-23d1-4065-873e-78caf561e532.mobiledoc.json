No. It’s not true that audiences can’t get enough. The growth is coming from supply side and technology changes, not demand side. There’s precious little evidence that young people want more video than older people – but they’re getting so much more of it.\n\nAnd short form? Well, yes, it’s working now. But is it the best way for the future?\n\nVideo consumption varies wildly by country. High in the US and Canada, but quite low in Denmark. The majority of people are *not* consuming news video. People still have an over-whelming preference for text . The figures are shifting a little towards video – but not hugely. And there’s little difference in the preference between the young and old.\n\nWhy?\n\nText provides *control* – it lets them get information *quickly*. Video is often supplementary: adding drama, context or reality. It’s adding trust – the footage is seen as credible.\n\n### Video road blocks\n\n![Nic Newman](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/nic-newman.jpg?resize=900%2C675&ssl=1 \"nic-newman.jpg\")\n\nPre-rolls are a real turn off for people. They are really viriolic about it – and their resistance is growing. The contrast between Facebook – where video just plays – and news websites where they have to endure a 30 second ad is marked."

This was the year when internet video started rivalry TV for breaking news.\n\n**2016** had the consolidation of live formats. Twitter did good work in bringing together the social and video environments – but ethical issues are rising with battles, suicides and assaults.\n\nIn **2017**? Short social video is a major priority, as is live – with their own sites, long form and VR lagging behind. But things have changed since January. Short form is commoditising rapidly. It’s really hard to monetise it. Facebook is now pushing towards longer view with midrolls ay 90s. Live is retreating – Facebook is no longer paying for it. Live is not efficient in an attention poor world."

Understand what your audience’s video needs actually are – and how they differ onsite and off site\n2. What might *future* users want?\n3. Is it a good investment against other content types?\n4. What are the realistic opportunities for revenue – especially as more pile into the market.\n5. What’s the role of offsite? Revenue? Priming the funnel?\n6. What formats and tools can make the process easier?\n7. What new skills do we need?\n8. Is this something we do ourselves – or do we partner with others.\n\n"
