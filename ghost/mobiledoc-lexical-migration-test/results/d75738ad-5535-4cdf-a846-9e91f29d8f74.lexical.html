A Trump-era edict threatened to strip people’s jobless benefits if they turned down work for fear of being exposed to COVID-19. The rule forced many into hazardous jobs; since last March, upticks in workers’ safety complaints <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trump-reduced-enforcement-as-workers/"><em>consistently preceded</em></a> spikes in COVID deaths.

Could be as many as 90 on some issues, less on others.”</em></li>
