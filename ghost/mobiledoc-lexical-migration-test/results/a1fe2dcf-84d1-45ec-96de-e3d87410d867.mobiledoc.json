While you might attribute that to the man departing for the Great Garage in the Sky, in reality it was the same way while he was in his prime. That’s just one of the things which comes with raving success. However, even we are taken aback a little by the recent announcement from Classic Recreations that it’s offering a continuation CSX Cobra for a cool $1.2 million."

That’s insanely lightweight, so much that Colin Chapman himself must be smiling on them. For good measure, Classic Recreations says each car will crank out 800-horsepower via a Ford Performance Gen 3 Coyote fed by a VMP Supercharger. That power-to-weight ratio is insane, making this truly fitting of Carroll Shelby’s legacy. Backing up that mill is a T56 Magnum 6-speed, while custom stainless steel headers lead to side pipes for a proper exhale."

Likely the company will sell all ten quickly, if they aren’t already all spoken for. Laugh at that all you want, because these cars will probably only appreciate in value as time marches on."
