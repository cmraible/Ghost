Ported and polished cylinder heads take advantage of the additional forced induction. To maximize that power boost, Buick installed a new computer chip and higher-flow exhaust. This resulted in a factory-rated 300-horsepower and 380 lb.-ft. of torque. This was a big deal for 1987 and MotorWeek shows its enthusiasm in the review."
