Apparently, the cap doesn’t vent properly, leading to the creation of a vacuum in the reservoir, which in turn can lead to brake fluid leaking. Just like in any hydraulic system, lose enough fluid and braking power is diminished or lost completely. Obviously, that would present a dangerous situation."
