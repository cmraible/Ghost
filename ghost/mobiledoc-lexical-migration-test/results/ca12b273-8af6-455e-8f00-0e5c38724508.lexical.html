<p>The days when I switched my blog design every few months are very long gone, but here we are again with a new look OM&HB, only <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/08/one_man_his_blog_rebooted.html">20 months after the last one</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like right now:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/assets_c/2014/04/Screen%20Shot%202014-04-23%20at%2016.40.41%20%282%29-3676.html"><img src alt="Responsive OM&HB" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>And this is why it is significant:</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve finally gone mobile-friendly and responsive.</p>
<p>I pretty much had no choice: tablet and phone traffic is nudging towards 50% of my site traffic – and it gets even higher than that on “big hit” posts. If I care about my readers – and I do – I should be catering to their device choice.</p>
<p>Also, frankly, when I’m talking to publishers and journalists about mobile strategy, having a design that’s not mobile-friendly was getting rather embarrassing.</p>
<h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-changed">What’s changed?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Responsive design!</strong> Yes, I said that above. But it’s the most important thing…</li>
    <li><strong>The sidebar returns</strong>. Yes, I tried to bury it all at the bottom of the page, but it didn’t work. A single sidebar is still useful.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing buttons are gone</strong>. An experiment: I want to see if the lack of sharing buttons has any traffic impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Pagingation</strong>. You can actually (at long last) page back through older entries from the homepage of the site.</li>
    <li><strong>Taupy RIP</strong>. Yes, the lizard finally bites the dust. Here, for a final time, is Taupy, the mascot of this blog for the best part of eight years:</li>
