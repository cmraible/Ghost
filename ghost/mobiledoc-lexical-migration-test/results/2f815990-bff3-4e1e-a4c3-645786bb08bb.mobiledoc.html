<hr>
<p>Usually when people put together a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-most-dramatic-barn-finds/">barn find car</a> video, it’s to highlight them grabbing some rare ride with the plan to fully restore and then sell it. While those can be fascinating stories and get the gears turning in people’s heads, this video featuring the resurrection of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-dodge-charger/">1968 Dodge Charger</a> that’s been sitting unused for years on end is even better.</p>
<p><strong>Check out an amazing, huge barn find <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/huge-barn-find-stash-uncovered/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does YouTuber Dylan McCool get the old Mopar muscle car running again on the spot, which we really love those types of videos, but he doesn’t do it to then drive off into the sunset. Instead, the guy is helping out the 80-year-old original owner of the Charger so the man can enjoy his beloved ride again.</p>
<p>We can’t think of many more worthy causes. Of course, McCool and the people helping him are also excited to see in person what few will ever behold. After all, it’s not every day you run across a barn find 1968 Dodge Charger that’s still with its original owner.</p>

<p>Despite looking rough, the Charger has obviously been well cared-for. After all, there’s the correct level of oil that looks clean, replacing the battery immediately turns on accessories, and the engine cranks on the first try. Still, there are different issues that need to be fixed and as McCool and his buddy go through it, they teach some budding enthusiasts how to work on classic cars.</p>
<p>As cool as it is to see this Mopar run again, it’s also great to see the family enjoy it once more.</p>
