<p>As stated in the listing, this is a two-door model. It has a nice red body with white roof, white accents down both sides, tailfins, and rocket taillights. This car really wows with all that chrome up front, down the sides, and in the rear fascia. In fact, a lot of people like the flashier nature of the ’57 Pontiac Star Chief because of all that brightwork.</p>

<p>The seller says a 502ci Chevy V8 with 600-horsepower on tap has been installed, so while a purely stock Star Chief isn’t slow this one will scoot something furious. Keep in mind the most powerful engine Pontiac offered for this car was a 347ci V8 with 317-hp. An R-700 transmission has been installed to handle all that power. This car has been tubbed and is running a 9-inch Ford rear end.</p>

<p>While the interior has retained a lot of its retro charm, there are some updates installed. The biggest one is a 1000-watt sound system, enabling you to jam out in modern ways to your favorite tunes while cruising in this Pontiac.</p>
