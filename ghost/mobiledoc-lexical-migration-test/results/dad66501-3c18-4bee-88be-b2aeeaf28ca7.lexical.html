<p>To celebrate its return to international sports car racing in the GT3 category, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/keith-richards-has-some-crazy-car-stories/">Bentley</a> produced a special edition of Continental GT. Production of the 2015 <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2015-bentley-continental-gt3r/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pcar2">Bentley Continental</a> GT3-R was limited to just 300 examples for the entire world to share and less than 100 examples actually made it to the U.S. market, making this one of the <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2015-bentley-continental-gt3r/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pcar2">rarest Bentleys ever</a>.</p>

<p>As implied in the name, <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2015-bentley-continental-gt3r/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pcar2">the GT3-R</a> shared many commonalities with Bentley’s GT3 race car. Under the hood is a specially tuned twin-turbo V8 engine mounted to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Bentley’s twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 engine is factory tuned to achieve an output of 592-horsepower and 553 lb.-ft of torque. An all-wheel-drive system divides this power between all four wheels and a unique torque-vectoring rear end ensures a smooth application of that power to the ground. </p>

<p>Bentley was also able to reduce weight by 220-lbs over the <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2015-bentley-continental-gt3r/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pcar2">standard Continental GT</a>. This and the implementation of shorter gearing ratios, a sport-tuned Electronic Stability Control, and a Carbon Silicon Carbide braking system makes the GT3-R one of the fastest and most nimble road-going cars Bentley has ever made. According to the British automaker, the car is capable of a 0-60-mph sprint in as little as 3.4 seconds but there are reports that independent testing has resulted in a 3.3-second run.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2015-bentley-continental-gt3r/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pcar2">GT3-R’s lighter weight</a> and almost laser like focus on performance, Bentley did not skimp on the interior. In fact the rear seat is the only sacrifice. A bespoke interior in Beluga black and green with diamond-quilted Alcantara upholstery is still representative of a high end luxury car. But Carbon fiber trim and GT3-R badging throughout refuse to let the driver forget about the car's sporty capabilities.</p>
