But one of the unexpected challenges is the area around the fuel filler is crumpled and the gas cap is missing (likely destroyed in the crash) so they’re concerned about throwing sparks down into the gas tank and igniting whatever fuel is left. At the same time, they realize the crash has pushed part of the fuel system into the shock tower, plus one of the rear control arms is a goner. That’s the thing when you buy a salvage vehicle like this, it’s impossible to tell what all will need to be replaced until you start tearing into the thing. So the question is would you take on a project like this?"
