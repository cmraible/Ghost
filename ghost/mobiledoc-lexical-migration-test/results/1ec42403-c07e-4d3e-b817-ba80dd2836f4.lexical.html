<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2000-am-general-hummer-h1-open-top/">The H1 Hummer</a> is a vehicle that will forever live on in Hollywood history as one of the coolest <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2000-am-general-hummer-h1-open-top/">military-style SUVs</a> out there. When it comes to menacing you can't get much more than a hummer, this bad boy is rocking a 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8, a 4-speed automatic transmission, 4-wheel independent suspension, and in-board mounted disc brakes making it one mean machine when it comes to the performance side of things.<br></p>

<p>Oh, but it gets better you see while other companies were focusing on how to make their cars rounder and more bean-shaped hummer drove headfirst into the boxy lifted machine we know today. This particular hummer comes equipped with 20-inch fuel wheels adding that little bit of flair needed to make this a truly scary masterpiece. At just about 16-inches of clearance and width comparable to a semi-truck, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2000-am-general-hummer-h1-open-top/">this bulky SUV</a> sticks out like a sore thumb both on the highway and on the off-road.<br></p>
