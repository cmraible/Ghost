<p>The Plymouth Road Runner was introduced in 1968 as a solution for those who wanted pure American Iron power for less money. Based off the Belvedere, the Road Runner was a two-door with a bench seat that was priced around $3,000 and could dominate the quarter-mile in the 14-second range. Out of all 82,000 Road Runners produced, only 2,128 were convertibles (with 238 of those said to be exported to Canada and elsewhere) so this <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/asp/LotDetail.asp?lid=55953985#Top?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1969 Plymouth Road Runner</a> (Lot #76) is a rare bird. The '69 Road Runner was also named Motor Trend's Car of the Year, and this stunning example is being offered from Sam's Auto - A Lifetime Collection on <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Proxibid</a>.</p>

<p>Finished in the original K2 paint Vitamin C, this vintage Mopar has been restored to factory specifications. Atop the engine bay sits a rare N96 grabber hood. Open the doors to a clean interior that is mostly black but features with contrasting wood-like accents.</p>
<p>Powering the Road Runner is a 383-cubic-inch V8 engine topped with a Coyote Duster air intake. Shifting power was handled by an A833 4-speed transmission that twisted a Dana 60 rear axle housing 4.10 gears. This classic car was full of muscle with 335-horsepower ready to roll. </p>

Not only is this classic a beauty to behold, it is likely not another person on your side of town (or entire town) has a Road Runner convertible that will be ogled over. Even better, this example can be seen a mile away with its rocking that bright orange hue and is being offered from the Sam's Auto - A Lifetime Collection on <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Proxibid</a>.</p>
