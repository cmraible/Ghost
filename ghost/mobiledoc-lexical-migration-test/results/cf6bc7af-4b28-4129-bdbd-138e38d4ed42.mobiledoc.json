When compared to its Chevy competitor, that equates to a .2-second advantage getting up to cruising speed and almost a full second advantage in the quarter-mile. Dodge’s Redeye puts up a tougher fight but still loses to this ultimate Mustang. For this vehicle class, performance specs like these are almost unheard "
