Someone called 911 and officers were on the lookout for the suspect’s Dodge Charger. When they spotted it, officers tried to perform a traffic stop, but the man seemed to think making a run for it was a better idea."

Instead, he pulled out a handgun and opened fire before police could stop their cars."

Unfortunately, he ejects two magazines before emptying them, likely from squeezing the gun too hard, accidentally pressing the ejection button. It’s easy to say you’d keep your cool in a life-or-death situation, but reality is something different. Gadson has to recover one of his magazines after more calmly expending all the rounds in his third one, then advances on Caballero as the man retreats further from the crashed Dodge Charger."

They retreated and used two Bearcats for cover while the suspect hunkered down for two hours. After Caballero surrendered, investigators say they found several firearms, ammunition, and machine gun parts in the house. Also, Caballero only had a flesh wound to the neck. He was hospitalized reportedly in stable condition. "
