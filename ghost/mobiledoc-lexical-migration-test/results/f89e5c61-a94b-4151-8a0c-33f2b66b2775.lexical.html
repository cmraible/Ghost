<h3 id="one-of-only-500-viper-powered-trucks-with-this-brightly-colored-special-edition-">One of only 500 Viper-powered trucks with this brightly colored special edition.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Sport trucks were all the rage in the early 1990s, but things got really quiet just after Y2K came and went. Fortunately, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1997-dodge-ram-richard-petty-edition/">Dodge</a> changed all that when it decided to cram the Viper's V10 engine under the hood of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fca-imagines-modern-dodge-rampage-pickup/">Ram</a> 1500 pickup resulting in the Ram SRT-10, and if these high-powered <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/trucks/">trucks </a>weren't special enough, there were also a handful of low-volume special editions offered over the course of the truck's three-year production run. </p>
<p>In 2005, one of those was the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/195341/2005-dodge-ram-srt-10-quad-cab-yellow-fever-special-466-of-only-500">Dodge Ram SRT-10 Yellow Fever</a> of which only 500 were built including 300 four-door models like this one.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, this special edition is defined by its Solar Yellow paint job and accenting black hood stripe. Inside, there were more special touches like yellow-painted accents on the dash and door panels as well as yellow-accented stitching on the black leather seats. There was also a serialized plaque under the air conditioning controls to indicate the build number of each Yellow Fever truck, and of the 500, this one is no. 466.</p>
<p>It doesn't take a bright yellow paint job or even a limited-production special edition to make the 2005 Dodge Ram SRT-10 collectible, though, as only 10,000 of these trucks were ever built from 2004 to 2006, and only about half of those were four-door Quad Cab models like this one. The ground effects kit, hood scoop, 22-inch Viper-style wheels, dual exhaust outlets and rear spoiler gave the SRT-10 an imposing presence, and this style was backed up by the 8.3-liter V10 pulled from the Dodge Viper.</p>
<p>With only 48,000 kilometers (around 30,000 miles) showing on the odometer, this rare 2005 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Yellow Fever is in perfect condition, and <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/inventory/dealer/Adrenalin+Motors+Syvan+Lake">Adrenalin Motors</a> has this muscle truck listed for $35,888.
