          "In a bid to meld road-legal sports cars with prototype racers, the Porsche Vision 920 was created back in 2019. The result was a hypercar that oddly shares some characteristics with certain Koenigsegg’s although we wouldn’t expect Porsche to acknowledge that. Not only is the body extremely aerodynamic and provides proper downforce for high-speed driving, the cockpit sits centralized for a commanding view of the track."

          "The first hybrid supercar the team at Weissach had developed, the Porsche 918 Spyder understandably has had a lasting effect on designs for years afterward. This is plain in the Porsche Vision 918 RS, which was in development back in 2019. An evolution of the production supercar, both the drivetrain and chassis technology have been pushed to the next level. Aerodynamics were also refined with the hope this vehicle would set new records like the 918 Spyder had when it debuted. You might notice the larger rear wing with two subtle canards and the smoother cover over the mid-mounted engine as primary examples of how this hypercar differs from its source material."

          ", Porsche has been involved with Formula E racing to help it perfect the technology. It’s no secret we have motorsports to thank for many designs used in today’s production cars. Even though the Porsche Vision E, which was in development last year, didn’t make it to production, the concept used principles Porsche learned from its Formula E endeavors, specifically the 99X Electric. The result is this radical-looking, single-seater race car which would’ve been marketed as a track toy or racer for well-heeled private individuals. Taking full advantage of the absence of an internal combustion engine, this hypercar looks about as flat as you could imagine."
