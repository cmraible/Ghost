Advocates say that under pressure from both insurance corporations and labor unions, New York legislative leaders are planning to block an up-or-down vote on the measure before the legislative session ends on Thursday."

          " Republican attorneys general in 17 states are attempting to derail a key climate lawsuit days before settlement talks are set to begin.
