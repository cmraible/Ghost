<p>Numerous police agencies across New England along with the FBI helped nab three men who are suspected of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/40-stolen-cars-canada/">stealing high-end cars</a> in three states between July 2019 and September 2019. At least a dozen cars were stolen from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and police estimate the total value of these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/luxury/">luxury </a>and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/exotic/">exotic </a>cars to be more than $1.5 million!</p>
<p>Among the cars stolen were a 2019 Mercedes-<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1975-maybach-limo/">Maybach </a>worth around $200,000 when new), a 2019 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rolls-royce-reveals-dawn-silver-bullet-collection/">Rolls-Royce</a>, 2017 Mercedes-AMG S63, 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600 and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rare-1994-bmw-850csi/">BMW </a>X4. The crew is said to have used one stolen car to then steal other, which is the case with a Maserati GranTurismo they took. Police chased the Maserati before it crashed head-on into one of the police vehicles, and the driver managed to escape in one of the other cars they had stolen. Many of the cars were stored at location in Irvington, New Jersey before being sold, and one car was intercepted at Port Newark in a shipping container heading for Africa.</p>
<p>All three suspected thieves are from New Jersey and are in their 20s, and while one man posted bond, the other two remain in jail on unrelated charges. Due to the crossing of state lines, the car theft ring will face charges in federal court including conspiring to transport stolen vehicles in interstate commerce, conspiring to transport stolen vehicles and receiving a stolen vehicle that had crossed interstate lines.</p>
