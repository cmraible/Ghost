<p>Today is a real “back to school” day. It's literally so for my daughters, who went off to start year 3 and year 6 this morning. And it's figuratively so for me, as I've got my first full working day for a long time.</p>

<p>We're just back from a lovely week camping in the woods — with even less internet access <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2022/08/newsletters-and-other-decades-long-overnight-success-stories/">than our earlier trip</a>. So, yes, this is another catch-up thread. The summer really has failed to live up to the old “silly season” moniker — there's been plenty happening while many of us have been desperately trying to escape our screens…</p>
<p><em>(Summer holidays: a period of time when parents try to escape screens, and children try to get time on them.)</em></p>
<p>Hang on to your hats, folks. We'll be looking at some interesting moves in local news, SEO, Twitter and more. </p>
<h2 id="putting-the-%E2%80%9Clocal%E2%80%9D-in-local-news">Putting the “local” in local news</h2>
<p>There's so many bad stories about local news in the UK that I rarely bother to link to them any more. At some point, I'll gather them together and write something longer, but at the heart of my thoughts is that there's still too much “doing journalism” and not enough “doing journalism that people <em>really </em>care about”. Here's Ian Carter making exactly that point:</p>
<blockquote>We are getting the best response from the stories that involve detailed reporting on the issues that really matter to people, ideally offering solutions and conclusions.</blockquote>
<p>Don't focus on abstract news values: focus on what people really need in their daily lives. </p>

<p>In the meantime, the picture looks grim for a lot of the regional press. Reach's journalists have been on strike, and the cost-of-living crisis has been making their salaries inadequate:</p><!--members-only-->
<blockquote>Press Gazette has spoken to nine Reach journalists and has heard stories of reporters taking up second jobs as lecturers, copywriters or selling items on Etsy to make ends meet.</blockquote>

<p>But let's not be entirely negative here. <em>Behind Local News</em> has been running a series profiling the Facebook-funded community news reporters and what's happened to them. This piece has a nice example of successful community-centric reporting:</p>

<p>(Although, one does wonder what's going to happen to this scheme, now Meta is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2022/07/facebooks-long-slow-breakup-with-journalism-is-underway/">less willing to fund journalism</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="a-large-medium-error">A large Medium error</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I used to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tags/medium/">write a lot about Medium here</a>. It occupied roughly the same mindspace in the journalism world that Substack does now. And that it faded away. Its founder, Ev Williams, recently stepped down in favour of a new CEO who was a prolific publisher on the platform. And he thinks that Williams' focus on journalism was an error: </p>
<blockquote>“For me, fundamentally, the mistake was thinking that journalism was where Medium was going to shine,” he said. “We have the source material that feeds journalism. In a lot of ways that’s unique and special. And Medium exists to do something unique. It’s not supposed to reinvent the wheel.”</blockquote>
<p>In other words, he's going to focus on making what's essentially old-school blogging pay. Good luck. All those newsletter platforms are playing in that space… </p>
