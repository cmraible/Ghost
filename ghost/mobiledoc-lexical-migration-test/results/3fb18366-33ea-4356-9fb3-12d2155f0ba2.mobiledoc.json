It’s not quite a restomod, largely due to its exterior, but it would be a shame to only give it credit as just another patina car. Powering this Chevy is an engine from more modern times, but the upgrades don’t stop there."

GM gave the full-size wagon a completely new body, and several engine options, but nothing like the engine that’s taking real estate in the engine bay today. Under the hood of this Brookwood wagon is an LS3 engine that’s dressed up to give it a vintage vibe."

Behind the engine is a modern T56 six-speed transmission with aftermarket clutch, which feeds into a beefy rear end with 3.73:1 gears."

Keeping it planted is an air ride suspension, aftermarket rear control arms, front control arms, sway bar, and panhard bar. It also benefits from new tierod ends, idler arm, and steering gearbox. This tank of a car gets the stopping power it needs from a set of 13” disc brakes on all four corners, that bring all the modern technology given to the C5 Z06 Corvette, and it rolls on Billet Specialties turbine wheels."
