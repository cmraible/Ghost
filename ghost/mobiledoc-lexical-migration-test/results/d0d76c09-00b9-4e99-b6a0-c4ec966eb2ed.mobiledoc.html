<p>These days it seems like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-crash-stolen-c8-corvette/">everyone wants to get their hands on the C8 Corvette</a>. That’s why the NC Education Lottery started offering Corvette & Cash scratch-off cards. Plenty of people buy them, but one North Carolina man <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-hellcat-hits-tesla-wins/">won big</a> on his birthday.</p>
<blockquote><em>Watch some thieves wreck a stolen C8 Corvette <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-crash-stolen-c8-corvette/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Steven Hair was celebrating his 66th <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-block-fox-body-daughter/">birthday</a> with friends and family at a dinner. One of his friends purchased two $5 tickets as a gift. One of those not only was good for a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-z06-2023/">brand new C8 Corvette</a> but also $100,000 cash, making for one sweet present. We can only imagine the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/younger-gearheads-restomod/">excitement at that revelation</a>.</p>
<p>The way the Corvette selection works for the lottery is that a winner gets to choose either a 2021 model or a “current available model” Stingray. That winner also gets to choose options, but the total value of the car is capped at $109,600.</p>
<p>Hair told local reporters he’s thinking of getting his Corvette Stingray in red, which is a good choice. After all, plenty of people dream of owning a red ‘Vette of any generation. There are a few other really great colors for the C8, but it’s definitely up to the man to choose what he gets.</p>
<p>The take-home cash amount Hair received after paying federal and state taxes was $70,751. Getting that much and a new C8 Corvette isn’t bad for a birthday present. The man plans to buy a new house with the money.</p>
<p>Now Hair is entered to win in a second-chance drawing along with all other Corvette & Cash ticket holders. Those winners will get the same prize package. According to the NC Education Lottery website, nobody else has claimed the top prize of a Corvette Stingray and $100,000, so there are still 3 winning tickets out there.</p>
