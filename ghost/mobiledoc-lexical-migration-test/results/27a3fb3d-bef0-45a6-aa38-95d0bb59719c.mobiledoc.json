That is where resto-mods like this come into play. Gone are the days of having to sacrifice reliability for cool-factor, because this car is basically a brand new car with the body of a ‘67 Mustang. With this car you don't have to worry about putting even more miles on top of what it already had because it's a new engine. Say goodbye to transmission issues because this comes equipped with a brand new automatic overdrive transmission. With this car the power backs up the looks and you can feel the speed dripping off of this car, a fine message to whatever lucky soul finds themselves in ownership of this fine masterpiece would be: Just have fun.
