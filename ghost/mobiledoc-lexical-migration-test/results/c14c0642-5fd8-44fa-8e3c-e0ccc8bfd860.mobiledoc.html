<p>On Wednesday 9/22 at 8pm ET (5pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will talk with <em>Daily Poster </em>senior editor and reporter Andrew Perez about how to file successful public record requests. <strong><u><a href="__GHOST_URL__/public-record-request-seminar-on-9-15/">Subscribers can register for and watch the seminar by clicking here.</a></u></strong></p>
<p>An important part of <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s mission is to provide our readers with the tools they need to scrutinize power. It’s why we published<a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizens-guide-to-holding-the-powerful-accountable/"><em>The Daily Poster Citizens’ Guide to Following the Money and Holding the Powerful Accountable</em></a><em>.</em> Now, based on subscriber requests, we are launching a Citizens’ Seminar series to share even more information with our team of supporters.</p>
<p>For the first seminar, we will be exploring how to use public record laws to uncover the documents and paper trails those in power don’t want you to see.</p>
<p>Perez is an expert on the matter. Over his career, he has filed hundreds of record requests, many of which have resulted in major investigative scoops. He's excited to share the secrets of his success, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to file public record requests.</li>
    <li>How to determine what kinds of records are publicly available.</li>
    <li>How to word requests for the best results.</li>
    <li>How to conceive and execute major record request campaigns.</li>
    <li>How to best follow up on record requests.</li>
    <li>How to minimize headaches and costs.</li>
</ul>
