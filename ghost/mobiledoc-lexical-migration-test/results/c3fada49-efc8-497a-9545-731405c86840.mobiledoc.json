That makes pitting these two performance machines against each other in a race an interesting proposition."

Not everyone loves the standard 7-speed DCT automatic transmission, but it does eliminate driver error when switching gears. However, this pony isn’t exactly a lightweight, tipping the scale at a mighty 4,168 lbs."

Sure, it has a slick eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive, but the Shelby is far more powerful. Then you look at curb weight, a mere 3,893 lbs. Normally, we’d call that kind of portly, but in comparison to the GT500 it’s not so bad."

It’s a better measurement of not only acceleration but also braking and handling performance. Some people are going to think this is great, others will deride it, but it is an interesting way for vehicles to face off."
