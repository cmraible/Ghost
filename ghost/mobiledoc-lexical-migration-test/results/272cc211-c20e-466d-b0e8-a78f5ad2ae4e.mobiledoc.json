That’s right, the Demon is back and it’s better than ever, pushing performance to a level the EV fanboys are going to absolutely hate.

That setup is good for 1,025-horsepower and 945 lb.-ft. of torque when running on E85. Dodge has made it clear this vehicle will run 8-second quarter miles right out of the box, the first production muscle car to do so. It’s NHRA certified at 8.91 seconds at 151.17 mph, so the thing does sneak under the 9-second mark."

So while this is a cool product that will be used by a few to humiliate Tesla Model S Plaids at the track, precious few will be used for their intended purpose. And thus ends the Hemi V8 in "
