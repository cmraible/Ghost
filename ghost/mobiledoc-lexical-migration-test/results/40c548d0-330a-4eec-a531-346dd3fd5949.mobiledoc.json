We’re just as shocked and amused as you probably are to hear this, but we got this straight from The United States Attorney’s Office Northern District of Ohio which revealed four guys are facing a string of charges associated with mail theft and stealing high-end cars. Hopefully Netflix is already hard at work on the movie adaptation."

We don’t know why buying cars is a crime, but it’s what they’ve been accused of doing. Anyway, they would then sell the vehicles in northern Ohio. All this took place from December 2021 to February 2022."
