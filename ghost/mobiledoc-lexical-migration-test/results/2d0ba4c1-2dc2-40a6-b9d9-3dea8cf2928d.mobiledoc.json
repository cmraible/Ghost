Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) has spent the better part of a year penning columns slamming Democrats for including a provision in the Build Back Better Act that would allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. His columns argue that the key reform in President Biden’s climate, health care, and anti-poverty package would “handcuff an industry in the business of inventing life-saving medical technologies.” While Paulsen has been vocal in his criticism of Democrat’s prescription drug pricing plan, he’s been silent on one of the real reasons why he may be opposing it."

Some of the busiest traders included House Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Marie Newman (D-Ill.), Susie Lee (D-Nev.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), as well as Sens.
