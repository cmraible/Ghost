Well we probably wouldn’t have had an influx of drab brown shooters in the seventh console generation but that's a discussion for another time. Anyone who has ever used a gun in a video game, or real life for some, will know that guns tend to have a rhythm to them. The long sustained fire of an SMG, the heavy thunk of chambering a shotgun round, ejecting a bullet casing in a lever-action rifle, it’s all very satisfying; So it’s kind of surprising that it’s taken this long for shooters to incorporate rhythm aspects to their games.

What’s worse is on the off chance you do find a gun, if it isn’t the grenade launcher or the rocket launcher, you might as well just leave it alone; all of the other guns are just slightly better than the starting pistol but these two are miles ahead of the rest, to the point where it pretty much guarantees you beating a full run with ease."

What makes this worse is that the entire game has a solid colour filter on it; most levels have a yellow filter over the top while switching to a black filter in later levels and because of this, everything blends together, making it very difficult to tell the difference between enemies and the environment. I recorded a small section of the game to show the rest of the Switchaboo writing team how bad it was but it didn’t look nearly as bad as I was experiencing it (still bad mind you), which means the game seems to have an upscaling problem when in docked mode."
