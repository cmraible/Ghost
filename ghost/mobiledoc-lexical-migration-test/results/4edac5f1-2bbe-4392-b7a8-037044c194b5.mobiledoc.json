Other than that, it doesn’t look like an American muscle car in the least. As one Instagram user chided, it looks like a Honda. We actually disagree with that; it looks more like an Acura. Another keenly observed GM has “lost that Americana touch completely” and they’re not wrong."

Everything is quite angular, because that means it’s a fast car or some such nonsense, eliminating any connection to the Camaro’s past since GM doesn’t want any of that nostalgic stuff. Digital screens abound because duh. There’s also a steering wheel which makes the C8 Corvette’s look attractive. Speaking of the C8, this designer is dreaming of putting the same dumb strip of controls in the Camaro. We think a Mobius Strip for the controls would add some soft lines to the interior and provide even more distractions for the driver, which seems to be the goal of automakers these days."
