<p>Covered in a striking coat of Regal Red, <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/impala?promo=MOTORIOUS17">this 1966 Chevy Impala</a> is one of only 1,856 full-size Chevrolets to ever receive the unicorn Turbo-Jet V8, rated at 425-horsepower. All of these ponies are funneled to the rear tires through a Muncie M21 four-speed transmission, and received by a positraction differential to get things moving.</p>

<p>Chevy also equipped <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/impala?promo=MOTORIOUS17">this Impala</a> with a special suspension equalization package, metallic brakes, and a heavy duty generator. The interior is decked out in red cloth seats with deluxe seat belts, has tinted glass, and a Comfortilt steering wheel.</p>
<p>As equipped, you could pick one of these Impalas up new for around $3,800 in 1966, but adjusted for inflation and collector car interest, it’s hard to put a price tag on one - the saying goes ‘it’s worth what people will spend on it’ when it comes to cars like these, and sometimes, that’s a lot. However, as a Motorious reader, it could run you <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/impala?promo=MOTORIOUS17">as little as $3</a> to own this car.</p>
<p>Once you donate <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/impala?promo=MOTORIOUS17">$25 or up</a>, Motorious readers will get double the tickets, so we like your odds to bring this home! Get your tickets <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/impala?promo=MOTORIOUS17">here.</a></p>
