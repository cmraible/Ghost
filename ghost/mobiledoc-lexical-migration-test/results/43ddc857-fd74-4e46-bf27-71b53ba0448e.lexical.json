Let’s just say some people really stretch the term “barn find” to mean something which sat for a few years. But this rare French car was sitting in the garage since 1959, so we think it definitely qualifies.",

The fact nobody had claimed the mansion for so long and the car sat in the garage undiscovered since the 50s is just unbelievable.",
