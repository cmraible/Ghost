The modified Nissan Silvia was roasting its tires furiously on a stretch of road in the coastal town located in South East Queensland. Video uploaded to YouTube shows the stunt, including some people who gathered on a street corner to cheer the guy on. Considering no fun is allowed in the land of kangaroos and koalas, one can hardly blame them."

What that means is the guy left tire marks on the road, which we believe is some sort of hate speech towards platypuses. Joking aside, police claim the hot tire marks on the pavement constitute “damage to the road.” Yep, Australian police are pretty much drunk with delusional power at this point."
