Thankfully, the wonders of modern technologies have provided us with better tools to fight corrosion. One of the tools you may or may not be familiar with is electronic rust control, something a woman in Ontario, Canada recently found to be insufficient at preserving the body panels on her 2017 Ford Escape."

That device puts out a weak electrical current throughout the entirety of the car’s metal components. Supposedly, that current will disrupt the charge between the metal and oxygen molecules, essentially stopping rust from forming."
