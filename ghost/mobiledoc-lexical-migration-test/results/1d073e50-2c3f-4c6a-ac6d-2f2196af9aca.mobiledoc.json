The high-end automotive event snuck through in March of last year, before restrictions were put in place in Florida as well as pretty much everywhere else in the United States, so it technically hasn’t been disrupted by COVID-19. This year the event will be held May 20-23 where attendees can see plenty of eye candy at the Ritz-Carlton as over 300 rare vehicles and their owners will flock from around the globe. Auctions, car test drives, and formal dinners make this quite the event to attend, if you have the chance."
