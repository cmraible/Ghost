The motor is assisted by a 6466 turbocharger which helps the car achieve horsepower numbers of 550-horsepower, however, this mild figure is because the car is being put through a break in period. When fully prepared this thing should be able to push out 650-horsepower easily. The builder wanted to also address some common misconceptions regarding Grand Nationals saying that you must still be careful and not run too much boost as this can still severely damage your engine.
