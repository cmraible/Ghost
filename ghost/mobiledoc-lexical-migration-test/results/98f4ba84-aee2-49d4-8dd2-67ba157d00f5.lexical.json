Rather than focusing on being big and hefty, these cars were low to the ground and sleek, which was the perfect transition for the pony car movement. These cars have been around for decades meaning that collectors have had plenty of opportunities to get their hands all over them. Still, one such example of the second generation has remained relatively untouched. Later years of the second generation of Camaro and Firebird have garnered far less popularity than the early models. Whether because of the low horsepower numbers, odd styling, or unique target audience, these cars are an often overlooked gem in car culture.",

Contrary to the point, this Camaro was kept by an enthusiast who obviously cared for it dearly before its eventual settling in the barn. Initially, the car rolled off the factory line in 1979, making it a pretty cool find as the second-generation Camaro's production would end just three years later in 1981. This car was likely treated to a lot of fast driving, but the car has retained a pretty good exterior over the years of sitting.",
