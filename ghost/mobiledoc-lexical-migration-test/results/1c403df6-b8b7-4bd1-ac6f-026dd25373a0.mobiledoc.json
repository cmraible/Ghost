After a rampage on the streets of New York City in which he hit a total of 5 cars, this eventually resulted in charges being brought down on the billionaire. Now almost a year later all charges have been dropped and the case has been dismissed. Why would someone who caused copious amounts of damage to other's personal property to be acquitted of their crimes you ask? The answer may surprise you."

This makes a combined total of 5 parked cars that Mr. Chen allegedly totaled.

Could it be a case of bribery, police error, or simply the passage of time resulting in less viable evidence? Unfortunately, it appears as though we will never know. Either way, this story should serve as a warning against drunk or reckless driving. Not everyone is a billionaire who can get away with literally anything, it is currently unknown what the state of the Porsche is. This is an extremely interesting story and a good lesson, looking into the way our society works along with the danger of reckless driving."
