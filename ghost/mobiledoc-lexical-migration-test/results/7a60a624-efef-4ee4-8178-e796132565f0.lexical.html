<p>Oldsmobile has a pretty impressive lineup of big V8 muscle cars with something to prove on the street and the drag strip. You may remember models such as the 442 and others like it who paved the way for American performance cars that we all know and love today. Production of these bad boys hit a stall after the oil crisis of 1973 but quickly picked back up in the mid-1980s. That's when cars like the Cutlass and Hurst/Olds began to take over the performance car market faster than most other vehicles. These cars were pretty crazy in their day, but we doubt you have ever seen one like this, from the <a href="https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/Seat-Covers/Top-10-Seat-Covers">car seat covers</a> to the exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of <a href="https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/Seat-Covers/Top-10-Seat-Covers"><strong>car seat covers</strong></a>, don't buy <a href="https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/Seat-Covers/Top-10-Seat-Covers"><strong>car seat covers</strong></a> until you read <a href="https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/Seat-Covers/Top-10-Seat-Covers"><strong>this</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Under the hood of this flamboyant 1984, Hurst/Olds racer is a massive 640 ci V8 engine that utilizes a set of two turbochargers to make 5,000 horsepower. That ridiculous number is enough to blast this rocket-ship-like car across the quarter-mile in just five seconds. An even crazier figure is the top speed at which the vehicle shoots down the track as it can hit 260 mph. That quarter-mile speed is far faster than the current fastest production car globally, which is pretty insane because this car is street legal. All of this performance is made possible because the engine can rev so incredibly high.</p>
<p>This thing can revolve 9,400 times per minute, which is a down-tuned figure from the actual maximum ability. Spinning tires and roasting pavement is no issue for this drag racing champion as it spends a lot of time on the track. Some videos, including those from 1320, have documented competitions against Firebirds, Camaros, Charger, and other performance cars of similar caliber. Most competitors don't stand a chance against this beast, making for a fitting legacy surrounding this classic muscle car.</p>
