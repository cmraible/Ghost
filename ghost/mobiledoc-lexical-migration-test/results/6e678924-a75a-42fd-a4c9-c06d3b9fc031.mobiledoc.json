As it evolved into the 968 enthusiasts grew sweeter on the car, but what would they think of this modern version? Porsche Club of America thinks it would only be possible by using Toyota/Subaru’s 86/BRZ platform, which probably makes you shudder. The little boxer-four engine isn’t known for great power delivery, but could Porsche jazz that up? Probably, but would it be worth the effort? "
