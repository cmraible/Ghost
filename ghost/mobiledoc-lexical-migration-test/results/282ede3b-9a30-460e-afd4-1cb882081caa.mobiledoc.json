Unfortunately it is too late to win the 1954, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1972, 1975, 1979, 1986, and 1988 examples. However, that leaves some of the most coveted year models still on the table, including the 1953 Chevrolet Corvette and the pinnacle year of the second generation - the 1967 Corvette. Another highly collectable model year still up for grabs is the 1956 Corvette that Jerry Seinfeld drove for an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jimmy Fallon as the passenger. This car is one of only 290 that wore the rare Cascade Green finish."
