          "Duesenberg automobiles are among the most prestigious, technologically advanced and stylish of the Classic Era, and these elegant pre-war cars are commonly seen as best-in-show winners at concours d'elegance events. The Duesenberg Model A was introduced in 1920, and it was America’s first production vehicle with a straight-eight-cylinder engine car and the first American vehicle produced with four-wheel hydraulic brakes. In 1926, Errett Lobban Cord acquired controlling interest in the Duesenberg Automobile and Motors Company and issued a single challenge, to build the most powerful and extravagant passenger car to date. The result of that challenge was the Duesenberg Model J, a grandiose automobile unlike any other, which utilized some of the most talented and brilliant minds of the era."
