<p>Good things are happening! A group of formerly detained immigrants can advance a lawsuit against a private corporation that operates detention facilities, while the president moved forward with “the single, biggest thing the Biden Administration can do on its own without Congress to improve the accessibility and affordability of health coverage.” The largest federation of unions in the country, meanwhile, is finally pouring money into new worker organizing efforts, while indigenous tribes are recovering thousands of ancestral remains from universities that stole them.</p>

<h3 id="immigration-detention-company-faces-class-action-lawsuit">Immigration Detention Company Faces Class-Action Lawsuit</h3>
<p>This week, a group of formerly detained immigrants <a href="https://www.lawweekcolorado.com/article/immigration-detainees-get-major-federal-court-victory-in-lawsuit-against-geo-group/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20former%20immigration,and%20Customs%20Enforcement%20detention%20facility.">won</a> a major victory in federal court against the GEO Group, a private company that operates the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora, Colorado. The court decision rejected the company’s attempts to decertify a <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/10/19/aurora-geo-group-immigration-class-action-lawsuit/">40,000-person</a> lawsuit filed against them, alleging that the GEO Group had engaged in forced labor and unjust profiteering.</p>
<p>This ruling has paved the way for the lawsuit to proceed against the GEO Group, which runs detention facilities across the country.</p>
<p>“This decision makes clear what our clients have long known: the cruel and unlawful practices at issue in this case are rooted in GEO’s desire to maximize profit and exploit the labor of vulnerable detained immigrants — not government requirements,” said Juno Turner, litigation director at Towards Justice, in a <a href="https://towardsjustice.org/2022/10/21/press-release-immigration-detainees-win-federal-court-victory-in-long-running-lawsuit-against-geo-group/">press release</a>. “We have been fighting to get our clients’ stories to trial for more than eight years, and this victory brings us one step closer to holding GEO accountable.”</p>

<p>The GEO Group had argued that it was protected by a federal law that defends government contractors from lawsuits while carrying out federal directives. “The record shows that GEO has not simply performed as ICE directed,” <a href="https://towardsjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-10-18-Order-dckt-380_0.pdf">wrote</a> Senior U.S. District Judge John Kane. “GEO went beyond its contract with ICE in requiring detainees to clean up all common areas and after other detainees under the threat of segregation.”</p>

<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em> below, a weekly feature reviewing good news, progress, and action steps that’s one of the many features available only to <em>Lever</em> supporting subscribers.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>Last week, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/Family-glitch-fix-affordable-care-act-plans/633893/">finalized</a> a rule fixing the so-called “family glitch” in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that shut out nearly <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/11/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-family-glitch-final-rule/">1 million people</a> from health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>The new rule has revised how dependents of workers can qualify for subsidies, ultimately extending premium health care subsidies to spouses and children of workers with employer plans that make health care cheaper.</p>

<p>“Fixing the ACA’s family glitch is the single, biggest thing the Biden Administration can do on its own without Congress to improve the accessibility and affordability of health coverage,” <a href="https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/1579870590034673665">tweeted</a> Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation’s executive vice president for health policy. By extending coverage to people who are currently only receiving financial assistance under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the foundation estimates that fixing the glitch could benefit <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/the-aca-family-glitch-and-affordability-of-employer-coverage/">5.1 million</a> dependents.</p>
<h3 id="worker-organizing-efforts-get-massive-cash-boost">Worker Organizing Efforts Get Massive Cash Boost</h3>
<p>The AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest federation of unions, is <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/afl-cio-organizing-investment_n_63497502e4b051268c493267?55k">committing</a> an estimated $11 million a year to hire and train more organizers. This initiative recognizes the staggering importance of providing additional resources and training to supercharge the <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/by-helping-self-organized-workers-labor-can-save-itself/">creative and persistent</a> grassroots organizing efforts already happening across the country.</p>
<p>This tidy sum of cash will go toward creating a department within the federation called the Center for Transformational Organizing, where organizers will work with researchers on campaigns boosting union density at a time when organized labor is facing devastatingly low numbers (just 10.3 percent of U.S. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf">workers</a> and a mere 6.1 percent of private-sector workers are currently unionized).</p>
<p>Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/afl-cio-organizing-investment_n_63497502e4b051268c493267?55k">told</a><em>HuffPost</em> that the new organizing money represents “unparalleled investment” as unionization gathers new momentum in workplaces across the country. “After decades of struggle, we’re in a moment infused with excitement, energy and hope,” she said.</p>
<h3 id="ancestral-remains-of-indigenous-families-to-be-returned">Ancestral Remains Of Indigenous Families To Be Returned</h3>
<p>The University of California, Berkeley is returning thousands of ancestral remains and sacred belongings to the Indigenous tribes they were stolen from more than a century ago.</p>

<p>“Those people who think this is not a big deal or doesn’t matter: Imagine someone goes to your cemetery, digs up your ancestors, packs them in boxes and puts them on a shelf,” Ted Hernandez, chairman and historic preservation officer of the Wiyot tribe in northern California, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/17/us/uc-berkeley-indigenous-repatriate-cultural-artifacts-reaj/index.html">told</a> CNN. “Our ancestors should not be in boxes or on shelves, they should be home with their families.”</p>
<p>As part of a larger movement of returning ancestral remains and belongings to Indigenous tribes, other universities, such as Vassar College and the University of Tennessee, are also repatriating ancestral remains. UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/22/us/indigenous-remains-colleges-universities-nagpra-trnd/index.html">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act committee</a> has restarted the process of return after long periods of years of stagnation.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read an excerpt from Derek Walcott’’s poem about memory, “<a href="https://poets.org/poem/sea-history">The Sea Is History</a>”:</p>
<p>Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?</p>
<p>Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,</p>
<p>in that grey vault. The sea. The sea</p>
<p>has locked them up. The sea is History.</p>
