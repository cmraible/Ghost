<hr>
<p>While weâ€™ve seen surveillance video footage of Dodges and other cars stolen in broad daylight before, this one of a Charger Scat Pack swiped in Fraser is definitely curious. While the Detroit area is certainly no stranger to organized gangs boosting Mopars, itâ€™s usually not so incredibly obvious and reckless.</p>

<p>As you can see in the video footage, the white Scat Pack is sitting in a driveway, blocked in by a Jeep and a work van. The thieves showed up on the morning of June 17, apparently when the people were home (with three vehicles in the driveway) and got the Dodge started.</p>

<p>To get the big muscle car out of the driveway, they decide to reverse over the front lawn, only theyâ€™re too close to the Jeep. Resulting contact between the two Mopars rips off the Chargerâ€™s bumper on the passenger side, leaving it hanging like a loose band-aid. The person reverses over the lawn just as a car drives down the road. We get people do weird things, but how could witnesses not think this was suspicious?</p>
<p>An even bigger question is how nobody inside the house heard the theft? After all, a Scat Pack isnâ€™t exactly a quiet car, plus it sounds like it mightâ€™ve crashed into trash cans or a garage door when it first pulls forward, before hitting the Jeep and making even more noise as the bumper gets mangled. Yet in the video you donâ€™t see anyone run outside, you donâ€™t hear any shouting, as if everyone in the house is passed out.</p>
<p>Something about this whole situation just doesnâ€™t add up. You can come up with your own theories about why. And so we see the car theft situation in the Detroit area keeps spinning out of control.</p>
