Cirrus Logic warned of a reduced product forecast from one customer (which it did not name) and the rumor mill jumped on board, saying it must be Apple (90 percent of its business comes from Apple).</p>\n<p>But even if it is Apple and the company is slowing down its production of iPad and iPhones, does it mean that the stock should be in a free fall?  Apple has grown at a rate of <a href=\"http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/earnings-estimates?symbol=aapl\">57 percent</a> over the past five years so it&#8217;s understandable that the growth rate will decline.  Apple had $156.5 billion in sales last year so if the company continued at that same growth rate for the next five years, revenue would reach $1.2 trillion, or the size of Australia&#8217;s GDP, according to a recent report by <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-24/apple-s-growth-slowdown-fuels-concern-of-shift-to-value-stock.html\">Toni Sacconaghi</a>, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/woz-apples-share-price-may-be-disappointing-now-but-they-will-probably-surprise-us-all/\">Steve Wozniak</a>, co-founder of Apple with Steve Jobs, said today that Apple’s share price, is “disappointing” but that he was confident the tech giant would come out with products which would “surprise and shock us all.”</p>\n<p>“[Apple&#8217;s]stock price is a little low right now. Over time I’ve seen Apple go up or down 2x over a few months. It’s very disappointing because if you look at the amount of cash that Apple holds that cash translates to one to two hundred dollars per share of stock just in cash form. So the expectations are a little lower even than they expect,&#8221; Wozniak said at a speech at the Login technology conference in Vilnius, Lithuania.</p>\n<p>And on Monday, famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet said that Apple should use its cash pile to buy back more stock. Doing so, Buffet said, would be like buying dollar bills for 80 cents.</p>\n<p>What is happening right now seems to be as much about market psychology as it is about fundamentals.  I&#8217;m not suggesting you jump in and buy Apple stock today, you never want to try to catch a falling knife.  But at some point, the negative headlines are going to give way and Apple could be a pretty nice buy.  Maybe Apple was never worth $700 per share, but a decline of such magnitude in comparison with the overall market and in the absence of a serious competitive threat seems overblown.</p>\n<p>Some could argue that Samsung is dominating Apple in the smartphone market, but it doesn&#8217;t account for the innovation that Apple is capable of.  To discount Apple to such a degree, would indicate that investors don&#8217;t believe Apple will have another hit.  One thing is for sure, investors will be paying close attention to Apple&#8217;s earnings results when it releases them on April 23.  And with so much negative news priced into shares, we may see a nice upward swing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px;height: 15px\"></div>\n"
