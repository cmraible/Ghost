<p>News outlets are predicting a coming “bacon apocalypse,” thanks to new regulations that require pork producers raising pigs or selling meat in California to treat the animals in a more humane way. While such warnings make for good headlines, as one of the articles in this week’s Weekend Reader explains, the hullabaloo misses the real issue: the terrible conditions and treatment of animals in the country’s factory farms.</p>

<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163225/bacon-shortage-california-meat-industry"><strong>The Truth Behind The Great Bacon Shortage Of 2022</strong></a> (The New Republic) — <em>“As California prepares to implement wide-ranging standards mandating more humane housing for animals like egg-laying chickens and pigs, the country’s top outlets have been filled with dire predictions about the coming ‘bacon apocalypse’... It shows just how comfortable American agribusiness has become with a business model predicated on appalling cruelty — and how uncomfortable it is with the public exercising its democratic rights to reel it in with regulations. But while California’s cage ban might save some animals from the worst of abuses, it will take much more than cage bans to challenge industrialized animal agriculture.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/building-unions-big-pharma-oppose-prescription-drug-bill_n_61312589e4b0f1b9705e6c7e"><strong>Unions Are Helping Big Pharma Fight Democrats’ Prescription Drug Bill</strong></a> (HuffPost) — <em>“‘‘This to me is just the latest example, frankly, of how some unions are willing to allow their valuable political capital to be hijacked,’ said a longtime strategist for organized labor, who asked for anonymity to protect professional relationships. ‘What these pharma corporations care about is being able to point to worker and labor support in lobbying certain Democratic legislators. That’s what this is ― period, end of the story.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/counterfeit-capitalism-why-a-monopolized"><strong>Counterfeit Capitalism: Why a Monopolized Economy Leads To Inflation And Shortages</strong></a><strong></strong>(BIG by Matt Stoller) — <em>“The lack of resilient supply chains in the United States (and around the world) was masked, until a global shock came among. That Covid would cause such a shock was obvious; as I noted above, before the pandemic hit in force, I predicted it. And now, the pandemic is introducing shortages into our politics for the first time in living memory, largely because our highly thinned out supply chains are no longer resilient. Forty years of consolidation suddenly met with a pandemic that required a social flexibility that our monopolistic commercial systems can no longer provide.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/climate/fti-consulting.html"><strong>How One Firm Drove Influence Campaigns Nationwide for Big Oil</strong></a><strong></strong>(New York Times) — <em>“An examination of FTI’s work provides an anatomy of the oil industry’s efforts to influence public opinion in the face of increasing political pressure over climate change, an issue likely to grow in prominence, given President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s pledge to pursue bolder climate regulations. The campaigns often obscure the industry’s role, portraying pro-petroleum groups as grass-roots movements. As part of its services to the industry, FTI monitored environmental activists online, and in one instance an employee created a fake Facebook persona — an imaginary, middle-aged Texas woman with a dog — to help keep tabs on protesters.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://jaeger.substack.com/p/dark-money-funding-gop-super-pac"><strong>Dark Money Funding GOP Super PAC Tied To Trump-linked "Stop The Steal” Attorney"</strong></a> (PolitiFi) — <em>“A new dark money group which has been supporting Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2022 reelection, is registered to Trump-world attorney and “Stop The Steal” advocate Cleta Mitchell, according to IRS documents. The group, a 501(c)(4) called Stand Up To China, Inc., is the largest donor of the cycle to National Victory Action Fund, a GOP-supporting hybrid super PAC which—since spending heavily on the GA special election in January— has turned their focus to promoting the campaigns of prominent Republican Senatorial incumbents, primarily Marco Rubio.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/hbo-barack-obama-a-more-perfect-union-documentary-film-review-recession-libya-iraq-afghanistan-wall-st"><strong>HBO’s New Obama Documentary Is Apolitical Propaganda (Jacobin)</strong></a> — <em>“</em>Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union<em> fails on almost every level. Kunhardt was either too uninterested or too worried about disrespecting the former president to include embarrassing but humanizing details that might have helped Obama’s early story rise above the level of a superficial campaign bio. Too focused on how inspiring it was that Obama made it to the country’s highest office, Kunhardt fails to mention that once he got there, he presided over rising economic inequality and deepened some of the Bush administration’s worst policies. Kunhardt’s interest even in the ‘politics of race’ is too focused on symbolism for the documentary to say anything real or interesting about racial injustice.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/16/your-gas-stove-is-leaking-air-pollution-inside-your-own-home-go-electric"><strong>Your Gas Stove Is Polluting Your Own Home. Go Electric.</strong></a> (The Guardian) — <em>“The gas in our stoves is mostly methane, a short-lived but super-potent greenhouse gas with 100 times the climate-warming harm of carbon dioxide over a 10-year timeframe. When burned, methane converts to carbon dioxide, and burning gas in buildings for heating, cooling and cooking is responsible for about a tenth of the United States’ carbon emissions.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/magazine/norm-macdonald-still-in-search-of-the-perfect-joke.html"><strong>Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke</strong></a> (New York Times Magazine) — <em>A profile of the comedian, who died this week: “Macdonald speaks often about a kind of Platonic form of a joke whose punch line is identical to its setup. He feels he came close in 1995 on ‘Weekend Update’: ‘Julia Roberts told reporters this week that her marriage to Lyle Lovett has been over for some time,’ he said, as a picture of the country singer’s asymmetrical face appeared behind him. ‘The key moment, she said, came when she realized that she was Julia Roberts, and that she was married to Lyle Lovett.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/science/chicxulub-dinosaur-extinction.html"><strong>The Rock That Ended the Dinosaurs Was Much More Than a Dino Killer</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“Our most dramatic origin story starts 66 million years ago. It was the apocalyptic instant when a rock from outer space slammed into Earth, terminating the age of dinosaurs and eventually offering a bountiful new world to our mammalian ancestors. For 40 years, scientists have studied the tale of this catastrophic object, known now as the Chicxulub impactor. Today, the impactor represents more than just one bad day on Earth; instead, it has become a kind of Rosetta Stone that can decipher deeper riddles about the origins of life and the future of human civilization, both on our planet and in other worlds across the galaxy.”</em></p>
