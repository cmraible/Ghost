<p>Besides a set of free-flowing cylinder heads, an aluminum high-rise intake manifold, a 735-CFM Holley carburetor, 11.0:1 compression ratio, header-style exhaust manifolds, and a beefy four-bolt main block, the all new 429-cid V8 also had a super large footprint that <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0321/open-roads--march/lots/r0020-1969-ford-mustang-boss-429/1053888?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0321">Ford’s 1969 Mustang</a> was not equipped to handle. Because of the modification required all <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0321/open-roads--march/lots/r0020-1969-ford-mustang-boss-429/1053888?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0321">Boss 429s</a> were sent off to Kar Kraft, of Brighton, Michigan to receive their new power plant. This Raven Black over black interior example, serial number KK-1356, rolled through the Kar Kraft factory on February 21, 1969.</p>

<p>It was equipped with a stout “Toploader” four-speed manual transmission and a 3.91:1 ratio Traction-Lok rear axle, an engine oil cooler, a competition suspension, and power front disc brakes. This car undoubtedly represented the best of the Mustangs and as such it came with a steep price tag of $4,087 or about $30,000 in today's money. In the end, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0321/open-roads--march/lots/r0020-1969-ford-mustang-boss-429/1053888?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0321">less than 900 other Mustangs</a> were made like this one making it extremely rare and desirable to the collector.</p>

<p>Today, you can expect to see enthusiasts pay upwards of $200,000.00 for a 1969 <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0321/open-roads--march/lots/r0020-1969-ford-mustang-boss-429/1053888?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0321">Mustang Boss 429</a> example in good condition but this is not one of those examples. This car is more for the type of person that would like to get their hands dirty with a blank slate restoration. Unfortunately, the car split with its 429-cid engine in the 1980s and has been stored in a barn for the last 30-years. Although in current disarray, this Mustang could be brought back to life by the right person and the accompanying build sheet and a Deluxe Marti Report would definitely make that journey easier.</p>
