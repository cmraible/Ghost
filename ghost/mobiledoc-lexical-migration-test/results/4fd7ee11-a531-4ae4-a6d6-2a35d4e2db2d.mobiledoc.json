What’s truly impressive is that the man can just start ticking off all kinds of facts about this and all the other cars in his collection. Sometimes we wonder about celebrity car collections, because it seems like these famous people buy vehicles because someone else tells them to, or simply because they look cool. Brown admits he thinks the Porsche 962 is a really cool-looking car – and it is – but went on to talk about its history."
