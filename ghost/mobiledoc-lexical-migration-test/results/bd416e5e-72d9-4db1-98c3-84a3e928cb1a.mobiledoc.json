The rear tires of the Mopar are on the boom, the front tires on the pavement. When the video starts the “owner” of the vehicle is already inside and has the engine fired up. That person hits the accelerator and spins the front and rear wheels seemingly uselessly in an attempt to get the car back."

In other words, it does seem to be useless. The video doesn’t last long, so we don’t know how this situation ended, but I’m guessing the Mopar never drove away."

It’s safe to assume this happened in Florida, but these sorts of scenes play out in cities across the country, especially as financial times get tight. With inflation flaring up and not just going away but potentially getting far worse, we might see more videos like this."

          "Funny enough, this video is educating people about the available features for a Dodge Charger. Since you can clearly see the front wheels spinning, some are learning for the first time all-wheel drive is optional on some models. It’s worth noting that towing a car with any drive wheels on the pavement can cause drivetrain damage. I’m not an attorney so I won’t weigh in on who’s on the hook legally for a mess-up like that, but I’m guessing the repo guy didn’t realize this was an all-wheel-drive Charger."

          "My advice with repos is this: stop spending your money on Disneyland vacations, daily lattes at the local coffee stand, eating at Noodles & Company regularly, shopping at the mall, etc. and cover your necessities first. If you still can’t pay for the basics, you might want to drive something older and paid for. Having to deal with a repossession is the worst, but it’s usually avoidable."
