<p>This week, I published a two-month long <a href="__GHOST_URL__/desantis-allows-anti-woke-giveaway-to-big-wall-street-donors/">investigation</a> into how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis oversaw a billion-dollar transfer of state employees‚Äô retirement dollars into high-fee, high-risk private equity firms, as the companies‚Äô executives donated to groups supporting his campaigns. </p>
<p>According to our analysis, DeSantis and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are the only two governors who have a seat on state boards overseeing how pension investments are made. In all other states, governors simply make appointments to the pension fund board, or, in the case of New York and North Carolina, have no influence over pension investments at all. </p>
<p>Arrangements like DeSantis‚Äô pension-board authority present a unique set of problems: To win elections in the United States these days, you have to raise enormous sums of money ‚Äî and particularly if you have your eye on the presidency, as DeSantis does. And if you‚Äôre a politician with a loathsome personality like Ron DeSantis, the most effective way to raise $200 million is to get donations from people who have policy interests before your office.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>Technically, Wall Street donations to pension fund managers overseeing Wall Street investments could run afoul of the federal ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù rule, which bars campaign contributions from certain private equity and other alternative investment executives to officials with influence or control over public funds. The regulation, which came into effect in 2011, was intended to prevent campaign contributions from improperly influencing investment decisions at public funds like pensions or university endowments.</p>
<p>This rule is particularly important because of how much money is at stake, and who is affected by it. In total, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/05/08/to-fix-private-equity-s-problems-start-with-pension-funds/feba0936-ed89-11ed-b67d-a219ec5dfd30_story.html">67 percent</a> of the capital flowing to private equity comes from the <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/quick-facts/national/">$5.6 trillion</a> public pension fund market. The enormous private equity industry, implicated in everything from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inside-helen-gyms-philadelphia/">closing hospitals</a> to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/toys-r-us-employee-private-equity-job-loss-testifying-congress-2019-11">laying off workers</a> to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/kkr-brightspring-disability-private-equity-abuse">abusing children with disabilities</a> ‚Äî depends on public pensions. One of the most effective ways, then, to rein in this predatory industry is to expand enforcement of the pay-to-play rule.</p>
<p>The opposite is happening: More public funds are being invested in private equity all the time. Just this week, the Florida legislature <a href="__GHOST_URL__/florida-lawmakers-help-desantis-shovel-more-cash-to-wall-street/">sent</a> a bill to DeSantis‚Äô desk that would allow a 50 percent increase in the amount of state pension money that could be allocated to private equity, hedge funds and private real estate. The California Public Employees Retirement System, the country‚Äôs largest pension fund, has an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/233204dc-93d7-4cd0-ba06-d699659dbec7">appetite</a>‚Äù to increase the $52 billion that it already has invested in private equity.</p>

<p>The key element that could help address the problem is the pay-to-play rule‚Äôs ‚Äúanti-circumvention‚Äù provision, which states that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‚Äúprohibits acts done indirectly, which, if done directly, would violate the rule.‚Äù This little-noticed provision means that if you are trying to bypass a campaign contribution ban by making a donation to an independent political action committee, that‚Äôs not allowed either.</p>
<p>But in the rule‚Äôs twelve-year history, the anti-circumvention provision has never ‚Äî that‚Äôs right, <em>never </em>‚Äî been enforced.</p>
<p>The provision continues to collect dust despite the enormous expansion of super PACs, which allow unlimited contributions and spending while officially not coordinating with campaigns.</p>
<p>In the case of DeSantis, direct contributions from private equity executives to the Florida governor likely would have triggered alarm bells at the SEC, especially as those same private equity firms nabbed millions in state pension dollars. Instead, these Wall Street interests donated to a 527 group ‚Äî similar to SuperPACs, but allows direct contributions to state campaigns ‚Äî called the Republican Governors Association, which in turn donated to ‚ÄúFriends of Ron DeSantis,‚Äù a non-official committee that coordinated directly with the governor on campaign matters. So far, the SEC hasn‚Äôt done anything to signal that this arrangement could run afoul of the anti-circumvention provision.</p>
<p>And this is just one example. In 2022, private equity <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-spends-nearly-150-million-to-fuel-2022-races-11667815766">spent</a> $150 million on political races, with the vast majority flowing through super PACs.</p>
<p>Recently, the SEC launched a broad-based crackdown on the private equity industry, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has positioned himself as an aggressive critic of Wall Street excesses. But cracking down on private equity requires a time-consuming rulemaking process that could ultimately never be completed, due to Congressional pressure and legal challenges.</p>
<p>Expanded enforcement of the pay-to-play rule, however, is a different story ‚Äî and could arguably be even more effective than the suite of new rules proposed by Gensler at reducing the scope of private equity and other alternative investments.</p>
<p>The agency could test the regulation‚Äôs anti-circumvention provisions and begin investigating how and why the Florida state pension fund made their investment decisions. These financial moves don‚Äôt appear to be in the best interest of pensioners ‚Äî our reporting showed in just three years, had the state pension instead been invested in a low-cost index fund, it would now have $10 billion more in its coffers.</p>
<p>If the SEC actually began issuing subpoenas to governors and other officials with control or influence over public funds requiring them to divulge their calendars, schedules, and text messages ‚Äî and then matched these records up with these politicians‚Äô campaign donations ‚Äî it is probable that the enormous flow of public funds into private equity would slow.</p>

<p>But expanding enforcement of the pay-to-play rule faces a key problem: The SEC has long delegated all of its enforcement authority to its staff, who appear to be all powerful when it comes to getting Wall Street off the hook and powerless to actually punish the industry for wrongdoing. The staff have routinely granted waivers even for standard-issue violations of the pay-to-play rule, as Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner reveal in their recent book <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-premium-how-private-equity-plunders-the-economy/"><em>These Are The Plunderers: How Private Equity Runs ‚Äî and Wrecks ‚Äî America</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Actual change ultimately depends on the level of public outrage over private equity‚Äôs massive level of influence in America today. While a few members of Congress have been vocal on the issue, it is difficult for these concerns to break through to the wider public, especially given the corporate media‚Äôs reticence to cover this issue in depth. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs all the more important that we have outlets like <em>The Lever </em>that are willing to invest the needed resources to cover this issue with the gravitas it requires.
