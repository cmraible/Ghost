We’d love to say we’re surprised to see this GMC Sierra had its wheels stolen at George Bush International Airport in Houston, but we’re actually only surprised the thieves didn’t just take the whole truck. Usually they do that and then help themselves to the wheels, seats, bumpers, and whatever else they want to sell on Facebook Marketplace."
