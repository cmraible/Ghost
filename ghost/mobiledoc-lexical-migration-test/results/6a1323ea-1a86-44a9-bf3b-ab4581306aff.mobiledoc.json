          "Many car enthusiasts remember the iconic Clint Eastwood film, “Gran Torino,” which utilized one of the most unique and beautiful cars to ever roll off the Ford assembly line to symbolize the father/son relationship between the main characters. This car was the perfect choice for the film as it is a far lesser-known model than its Mustang or Mercury brethren. Nowadays, we have an even more excellent Gran Torino rolling around the streets of California with a massive V8 motor under the hood. The reasoning behind comparing the two cars is that this customized Ford beast was a tribute to the current owner’s grandmother. She was the original owner of this vehicle."

          "Of course, this thing has been transformed from the mild grocery-getter that it once was in the late 1960s into a racing-inspired performance machine. Under the hood is a gigantic 427 ci Stroker V8 engine that utilizes a big camshaft to produce a thunderous exhaust sound from the tailpipes. Along with the beautiful sound, the motor also puts out 560 horsepower and 540 ft/lbs of torque, making hooking and acceleration a violent experience of raw brutality. But, of course, it takes a special kind of person to drive this wild animal of a car, and the owner seems to know exactly what he’s dealing with."

Every part of this car was meticulously crafted to build on top of what Ford wanted this car to be. Elegant, composed, and graceful are all words that could describe the massive vehicle from the factory, but this car adds something that we can all agree was missing. That design carries through the entire build as even the rear wheels have been increased in size to make up for the car’s substantial back end. Overall, this is a great car built by a man who left no stone unturned pursuing automotive greatness."
