The season started with a ninth-place class finish at Sears Point, but all other races had this car on the podium including seven straight victories to finish the season. Despite such a dominating performance, this Jaguar XJ-S was retired after the 1978 season and it was parked until it was sold to a collector in 2007."

Those fat Goodyear tires are beautifully tucked under the fenders and massive exhaust pipes poking out of each side, but for the most part, the racecar's body looks as classy as its production counterpart. Having been registered with the FIVA and mechanically restored back in 2007, this 1978 Jaguar XJ-S is ready to win races or awards!"
