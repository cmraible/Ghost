Revealed at the Tokyo Motor Show, most thought it was just another crazy concept, in part because it debuted at a show known for zany concepts which never even inch towards production. Then Honda craftily released a string of T-Series concept bikes, which were crafted using outsiders, resulting in truly unique designs. It was the Honda T2 concept which we now can see was obviously the blueprint for the design of the Rune."

Instead of a fun but sensibly-powered V-twin, Honda used its 1832cc flat-six from the Gold Wing, but with 6 throttle bodies instead of only 2, resulting in a slight power bump. Of course, that engine comes with some weight, with the Rune tipping the scale at a hefty 878 pounds. But, the power curve and that Sirens’ song of an exhaust note is completely worth the trade-off."

In fact, executives at American Honda strongly hinted to the media that each bike was sold at a tremendous loss. Some people have speculated Honda lost as much as $75,000 on each Rune sold. However, what an advertisement for Honda motorcycles! It’s a true halo model, something to which Honda fans can point to with great pride. And there’s no telling how many more bikes Honda has sold as a result."
