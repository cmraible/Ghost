The easy guess is this was too much vehicle for the driver, who likely really got on it, lost control, swerved to miss another vehicle/retaining wall/something else but clipped it at the front corner on the driver’s side, then drug the side of the crossover down that obstacle all the way to the rear bumper. The rear axle is likely broken since the wheel is going in a direction you wouldn’t want (unless you’re into stance) while the front wheel looks to be pretty much obliterated along with most if not all the associated chassis components."
