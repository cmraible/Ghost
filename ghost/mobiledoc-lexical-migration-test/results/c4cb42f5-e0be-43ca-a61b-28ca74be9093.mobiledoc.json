Plus, airplane engines were far more reliable versus their automotive counterparts. Even by today’s standards this car is decently quick and can hit some good speeds, something you can’t legitimately say about many vehicles made even 15 years later. It’s a testament to the advanced engineering of Mercedes-Benz. Plus, this is just a fun car to see driven."
