This car really wows with all that chrome up front, down the sides, and in the rear fascia. In fact, a lot of people like the flashier nature of the ’57 Pontiac Star Chief because of all that brightwork."

Keep in mind the most powerful engine Pontiac offered for this car was a 347ci V8 with 317-hp. An R-700 transmission has been installed to handle all that power. This car has been tubbed and is running a 9-inch Ford rear end."
