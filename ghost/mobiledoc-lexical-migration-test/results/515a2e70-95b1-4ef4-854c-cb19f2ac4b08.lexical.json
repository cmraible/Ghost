They’re such cool cars and it’s a very iconic look to say the least but it’s very rare that we get a glimpse of the real deal. In fact, only three hero cars were actually used for the movie, Gone In 60 Seconds  . Essentially that means that the real Eleanor cars are some of the rarest vehicles to ever be featured in film or television. Add onto that the major Travis he that comes with the trademark name and you have a recipe for an incredibly difficult to find automobile.",

You’ve probably heard the story 1 million times, but here’s just one more to really ruffle your feathers. Essentially those who would want to replicate the car they only use the name if the vehicle will not be used to make a profit unless you buy the license for $25,000. It’s actually kind of hard to understand why people get so upset about it, it’s not their property so obviously they can’t just take it without asking. Either way, that’s certainly not something the owners of this vehicle have to worry about it and with such unique features as a “accidental Borla exhaust “ it’s pretty much one of a kind.",
