With only 11,343 actual miles on the odometer, this Vantage looks absolutely stunning with its black 10-spoke wheels, the subtle Quantum Silver exterior and that eye-catching Chestnut tan interior. The heart of this British beast is a 5.9-liter V12 laying down 5.9-liter V12 through a seven-speed, paddle-shifted gearbox, and this V12 and quick-shifting drivetrain helps rocket the Vantage from 0-60 in under four seconds! In true Aston Martin fashion, this car comes loaded with all the goodies, and it even has a carbon fiber appearance package included in its $89,995 asking price."

This black and red Vantage GT4 costs about half as much as of the other with a price of $75,000, and while it isn't clear what differences there are between these two Vantage GT4 racecars, this one is still ready for more racing action. Like the previous GT4, this Vantage comes with lots of racing equipment like the data logging system and numerous lightweight carbon fiber components."
