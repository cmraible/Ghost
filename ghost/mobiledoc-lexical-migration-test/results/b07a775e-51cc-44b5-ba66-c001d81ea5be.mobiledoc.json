Only in this story, Goliath would stomp David in front of a cheering crowd. However, if you’ve raced or watched enough races, you know when it comes to car which are far from stock, anything is possible."

It’s an important thing since a driver with a slow reaction time and all-around bad skills can seriously slow down the quarter-mile run for any vehicle."

These are without a doubt focused builds, most like not something designed to just take on a course with plenty of tight turns."

These Civics never stood a chance, something anyone who knows about the Cadillac CTS-V would completely suspect. In other words, the Honda fanboys are probably screaming through tears of grief at the moment. They somehow don’t understand there are some pretty tight limits on a four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive car. That’s just science."

While the Hondas put up a good fight, ultimately none of them get even close to taking the Caddie down. The last race is the best, with the American sedan doing a wheelstand and smoking the Civic, which impressively did an 8.850-second run."
