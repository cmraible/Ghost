<p>Quite a few names have been anounced to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, 50 to be exact. Tim Duncan is on the list, and his name is included with the late Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, and Chris Bosh. Duncan's love for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/8-classic-cars-to-invest/">classic cars</a> was in full swing during his NBA career. He was often searching and buying <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/390854/american-muscle-car-barn-find/">American cars</a> to add to his hoard and would restore them if necessary.</p>

<p>Duncan sat down with NBA writer Chris Sheridan to discuss his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/374714/floyd-mayweather-car-collection-social-media/">classic car collection</a> years back, a man that isn't much for the media spotlight. When told what they would be discussing, Duncan was ecstatic to share his love for American classics while shooting a few hoops together at Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>According to his informal interview, Duncan has a few of his favorite American classic cars to share.</p>
<p><strong>5. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/185179/1966-pontiac-gto-tribute">1966 Pontiac GTO</a></strong></p>
<p>During the time of the interview, he was on the search for a '66 Pontiac GTO. When the interview first was made public, a reader sent in a lead for a classic GTO for sale where Sheridan passed on the information to Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>4. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/177818/1969-dodge-charger-r-t">1969 Dodge Charger</a></strong></p>
<p>This is another car that sat on Duncan's dream car list instead of in his collection. He wanted the muscle car that starred in the '80s television show "The Dukes of Hazzard" that Bo and Luke Duke piloted around.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/185642/1955-chevrolet-bel-air-convertible">1955 Chevrolet Bel Air Convertible</a></strong></p>
<p>A '55 Chevy Bel Air 'vert sits in Duncan's collection, a California car that he purchased when a friend gave him a heads up about it sitting on a car lot. Duncan's classic Bel Air has been fully restored and features a white exterior and matching interior.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/185622/1968-chevrolet-camaro-ss">1968 Chevy Camaro</a></strong></p>
<p>A '68 Chevy Camaro also resides in Duncan's collection, and his is a hardtop model slathered in black. Under the hood sits a high-performance 502 crate motor, one that can be special ordered.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/183066/1950-mercury-coupe-lead-sled">1950 Mercury</a></strong></p>
<p>Duncan owns one of these and calls it the "lead sled".</p>
