Some accused him of paying to have it stolen as part of an insurance scam, going so far as saying it was dropped into the Atlantic Ocean from a plane so it would never be found. Pugliese has denied those allegations, saying he could have easily sold the classic movie car instead of collecting the insurance money."

Considering its value today, the insurance company might make off like a bandit when all is said and done."
