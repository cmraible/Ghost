This car was the first Future GT Forty to be built with a V-8 and was also the first with a wide body kit. Like the show car, it is painted in the same red, white and blue livery as the No. 68 Ford GT that won the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans."

This includes the aero package consisting of a front splitter, dual canards (the front winglets ahead of the front wheel opening) and a detachable rear wing all created from carbon fiber. For maximum handling, this car is also fitted with Wilwood six-piston brakes, HRE center lock wheels (18 inches front, 19 inches rear) and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The wide body kit provides enough space for massive 345-series rear tires, which offers over a foot of contract tread to lay down some serious rubber!"
