          ". They believe such a display is in poor taste, like wearing a shirt plastered with such logos, and we’d have to agree. It kind of looks like a bad camo wrap used by an automaker to disguise the contours of the body, absolutely destroying the exterior aesthetic appeal of the Wraith. We sure hope this guy is getting some sort of commission from Dior to advertise the brand in such an obnoxious way, but it’s likely he isn’t that savvy. But it is mentioned in the reveal video the guy wears Dior clothing “like crazy.”"
