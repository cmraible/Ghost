<p>Unfortunately, 2020 has been a year of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-riots-are-affecting-the-auto-industry/">many riots</a>. The most tragic thing about the violence is the loss of human life, followed by the loss of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wisconsin-rioters-loot/">people’s livelihood</a> or home. But for most, their vehicle is the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alpina-z8-crashed/">second most expensive asset they own</a>, plus it’s the thing that allows them to get around. Even if a car is a hobby vehicle, having it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/vandalized-muscle-cars/">severely damaged</a> or completely destroyed in a riot is still a nightmare. What’s even worse is to find out after the fact your insurance won’t cover the damage, leaving you high and dry.</p>

<p>According to the Insurance Information Institute, comprehensive coverage on an auto insurance policy should apply to riot damage. That can include damage to the car and anything in it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-torch-porsche/">from fire and vandalism</a>, as well as theft of objects. Depending on your policy, you might not even have to pay a deductible for glass replacement.</p>
<p>Some people wonder if having comprehensive coverage on an auto insurance policy is worth the extra money. If you’re making a car payment, your lender likely requires it. But if you own the vehicle outright, you have to decide if the expense is worth <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-911-gt3-rs-riots-runs/">guarding against the risk</a>.</p>

<p>Your insurance provider might not allow you to add comprehensive coverage to your vehicle once rioting has begun in the area. It’s the same story with adding flood damage coverage to your house once flooding has started. In other words, you need to make the decision ahead of time, not wait until <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-steal-hellcats/">you see a problem</a>.</p>
<p>To be absolutely clear, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/virginia-dealership-damaged/">vandalism to private property is a criminal act</a>. We aren’t saying it’s no big deal, but instead wanted to inform readers about how auto insurance might cover riot damage to a car. Armed with this information, you can make decisions about changing your coverage or how you secure your vehicle.</p>
<p>Even if your auto insurance policy covers riot damage, it’s not a victimless crime. Anyone who’s filed an insurance claim knows the process can be time-consuming and frustrating. You might have to pay a deductible. Plus, insurance companies can increase premiums for people living in a community they feel is more at risk for riot damage, just like they do for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/worst-cities-car-thefts/">areas which have a higher car theft risk</a>.</p>
