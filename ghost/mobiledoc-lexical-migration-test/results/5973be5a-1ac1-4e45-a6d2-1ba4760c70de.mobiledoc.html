<p>This week, <em>The</em><em>Lever</em>‚Äôs<em></em>podcasts dig into some thought-provoking topics. On <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota speaks with investigative journalist Jefferson Morley, one of the leading experts on the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. Even though the Biden administration recently released thousands of new documents pertaining to the assassination, there‚Äôs still a trove of documents that the CIA is keeping under wraps. David and Jeff discuss what we‚Äôve learned from the new documents ‚Äî and what we still don‚Äôt know. </p>
<p>On <em>Movies vs. Capitalism</em>, Rivka and Frank are joined by actor and organizer Chris Myers for a deep-dive conversation about the 2006 dystopian classic, <em>Children of Men</em>. The group unpacks how such a seemingly bleak movie finds moments of joy and optimism, and how the film is even more relevant today, seventeen years after it was released. <em>The Audit </em>is still on winter break, so now is a great time to catch up on the first two mini-seasons.</p>

<p>The group discusses how this 2006 film is terrifyingly reflective of today's world and our failing social systems. They also discuss its brilliant cinematography, the theme of ‚Äúfaith vs. chance,‚Äù as well as the various forms of organizing that activists utilize in the movie and what we can learn from them. Rivka and Frank also get into Mark Fisher‚Äôs theory of ‚ÄúCapitalist Realism,‚Äù and how it relates to film and creativity.</p>
