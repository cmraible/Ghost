The reported value of the items seized was a whopping $3.9 million USD. That’s quite the haul."

We’re guessing how you feel about him is how you’ll feel about his cars being seized by the government. Although we do know quite a few gearheads aren’t a fan of government seizures of property at all, viewing the move as legalized theft, no matter who it happens to."

The British-American citizen was scooped up by authorities on December 29, however authorities returned on January 16 for his cars and some luxury watches as insurance that should the victims of Tate’s alleged crimes be rewarded financial compensation, Tate doesn’t duck the consequences."

In other words, he has considerable financial incentive to comply with whatever the Romanian justice system produces as far as a verdict and judicial order, whether he thinks it’s fair or not."
