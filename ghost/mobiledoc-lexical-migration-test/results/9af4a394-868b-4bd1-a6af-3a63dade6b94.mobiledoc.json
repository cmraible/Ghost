Not everyone wants to accept that, just like how they keep wanting to believe Hart crashed his own ‘Cuda (that was his wife’s personal trainer’s fiancé, by the way). You don’t have to like his comedy but you do have to admit Hart has quite the car collection."

The exterior is mostly blacked out, although there are the dog dish hubcaps, side mirror caps, door handles, grille grid, and a few other shiny bits. The bumpers fit flush against the body and the overall presentation is tight."
