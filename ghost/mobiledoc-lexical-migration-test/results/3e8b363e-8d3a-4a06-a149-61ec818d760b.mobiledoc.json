The race was scheduled for March 18-21, but is now on hold for now due to the recent ban on travel from Europe which prevents a number of drivers, teams, and key personnel from participating. Now, this race will be the season-ending event of 2020 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship held November 11-14 at Sebring International Raceway instead. The IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge will be rescheduled for that same weekend. Those that have purchased 2020 admission tickets and parking will have that honored during the rescheduled weekend in November."
