<p>The Saudis have a healthy taste for American <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/american-muscle" rel="nofollow">muscle cars</a>, so it’s not a surprise to learn the 1965 Blizzard Mustang will be making an appearance at the inaugural Riyadh Car Show. Built by the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/1969-ford-mustang-mach1-ringbrothers" rel="nofollow">Ringbrothers</a> as a SEMA vehicle, this Ford <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">Mustang fastback</a> has been restomodded to look sleek and go fast.</p>

<p>The simplified body lines on this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">car</a> are perfectly complimented by the Blizzard White paint. Exposed carbon fiber and gloss black on various parts add the perfect amount of contrast. The minimalist design allows the HRE 560R forged wheels to really shine, especially since the design is different between the front and rear.</p>
<p>We all know it’s what’s under the skin which matters most, and the Blizzard Mustang certainly doesn’t disappoint in that department. A highly modified 427ci V8 built by Wegner Motorsports gets heavy inspiration from the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIm5hc2NhciJdfQ==" rel="nofollow">NASCAR</a> Sprint Cup Series. The result is 710-horsepower of American muscle. A Holley carb takes care of the inhale and an exhaust with Flowmaster Mufflers manages the exhale. The driver manages engine revs through a Bowler 5-speed manual transmission.</p>
<p>As for control, this car has it in spades, which you wouldn’t expect on a ’65 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/Mustang" rel="nofollow">Ford Mustang</a>. A John’s Industry differential and Baer six-piston calipers help. Tightening up the chassis further is a Detroit Speed & Engineering front coilover, plus a Quadralink suspension with AFCO shocks and DSE sway bars in the rear. The point was to make this Ford Mustang handle as well as Stock Cars, which were the inspiration for the build in the first place.</p>
<p>Finishing off this build is a custom interior with plenty of billet accents, something you should expect from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/ringbrothers-valkryja-1969-chevy-camaro" rel="nofollow">Ringbrothers</a>. Custom Upholstery Unlimited covers for the Recaro seats add a luxurious flair, while a modern Alpine sound system makes this a ride you could use for cruising through town with the windows down.</p>
<p>Held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from November 21 through 26, the Riyadh Car Show has an impressive range of vehicles. This is one of six Ringbrothers cars which will be on display at the show, the most the Wisconsin-based builder has had at an event. All six are available to purchase, so they’re not just for looking, although you can certainly enjoy doing that.</p>
