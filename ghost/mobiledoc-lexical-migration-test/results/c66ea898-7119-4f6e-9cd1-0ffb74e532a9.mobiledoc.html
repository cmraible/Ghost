<p><em>Real Housewives of New Jersey </em>cast member <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/jennifer-lopez-is-now-driving-around-in-a-rivian-suv/">Jennifer</a> Aydin and her husband have joined the growing number of victims who had a car stolen in 2022. In and out in only 3 minutes, the brazen thieves swiped the car late Sunday night. Due to policy, this is happening more and more in New <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/featured-dealer-south-jersey-classic/">Jersey</a>, making it one of the biggest hot spots for car thefts in the country.</p>
<p><br>“Bill’s Ferrari got stolen from our garage in Paramus within the last House hour and a half. Please message any info or if anyone has seen a red Ferrari California, please notify Paramus PD.” Jennifer Aydin said in a tweet on April 3, 2022.</p>
<p>“My kids and parents and other friends were all home,” said Jennifer Aydin.</p>
<p>The couple’s 17-year-old son, Justin, pulled up as they were leaving with the car. He witnessed the thieves speed off in the 2016 Ferrari as it was leaving the $3 million 12,000-square-foot mansion, with a white SUV behind the supercar.</p>
<p>Other vehicles were rummaged through, but it was likely the fact that the Ferrari’s key fob had been left in it the car. Adding to the carelessness of leaving the fob with the car, a New Jersey bail reform law that requires local authorities to release all but the most violent offenders, so there’s little  stopping car thieves from lifting expensive cars from suburban New Jersey streets.</p>
