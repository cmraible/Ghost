<hr>
<p>Marcello Gandini with the Carrozzeria Bertone introduced the Alfa Romeo Montreal to the public in 1967 at the Expo 67 World’s Fair in Montreal, Canada. The public gave the model a great reception and so the automaker made it a production model. Once it did go into production, only 3,925 were made, and of those, only 100 made it to North America. <a href="https://stratas.auction/auction/1972-alfa-romeo-montreal-86">Examples like this</a> model are extremely rare to find in the U.S.</p>
