<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The midterms are officially over — so what happens now? On <em>Lever Time</em>, the entire <em>Lever</em> reporting staff and I offer our analysis of this Tuesday night’s surprising elections. Then, I'm joined by <em>Breaking Points </em>co-host Krystal Ball for a big-picture conversation on what these results portend for the next two years of Biden’s presidency, as well as the 2024 presidential election. Meanwhile, <em>The Audit</em>’s study group FINALLY completes George W. Bush’s MasterClass. Did they ultimately learn anything? Not really, except for the fact that high-priced PR firms can successfully whitewash the legacies of pretty much anybody — including war criminals.</p>

<p>In the new episode of our “educational” series <em>The Audit</em>: Dave, Josh, and their study-buddy Kate Willett dive into the final installments of George W. Bush’s MasterClass, including an 18-minute lesson on cold wax painting (which, to be honest, might be the only valuable thing that Dubya talks about during this entire series).</p>

<p>Dubya’s final two lessons, “Prioritize What’s Important,” and “Happy are the Painters,” can only be described as “a celebration of nonsense.” Dubya relays some fun drinking stories, teaches everyone about the Turd Blossom, and expounds on his love of painting. Is it possible this was all just a sham? A charade to whitewash the record of one of America's worst war criminals? Listen and find out!</p>
