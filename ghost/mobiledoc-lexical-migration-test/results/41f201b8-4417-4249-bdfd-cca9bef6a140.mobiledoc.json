Maybe you’re like us and don’t like all the modern safety systems, but we have to admit features like Toyota’s Safety Connect can save your skin in a bad situation. To help tempt shoppers who might be on the fence about getting a new Toyota, the company has announced an extension of Safety Connect and Service Connect trials."

There’s Maintenance Reminder, which sends notices to your email, Toyota app, or through the Toyota Owner’s account so routine servicing isn’t skipped over. The Vehicle Health Report helps manage recalls and service campaigns and can be accessed through the Toyota app. Finally, customers can opt for the Vehicle Maintenance Alert, which sends service and maintenance alerts to a selected dealer so an employee can contact the vehicle owner to schedule an appointment."
