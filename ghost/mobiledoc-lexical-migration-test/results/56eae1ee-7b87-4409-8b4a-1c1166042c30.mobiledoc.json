          "Restoration work was performed by The Landrovers, marque experts located in The Netherlands, in 2015, and the overall quality and attention to detail on this Defender is incredible. It's hard to miss any Land Rover Defender 110 that has been modified, but this one is especially eye catching since it is finished in a bright Portofino Red hue with black wheels, exoskeleton roll cage and gloss black fender extensions. The roof rack holds just about anything you'll need for an off-road adventure including a high-lift jack, axe, shovel and, of course, a pop-up tent with an integral mattress."

To ensure this 1990 Land Rover Defender 110 is ready for the trail, the interior has also been fitted with GPS, a back-up and an aftermarket stereo with Apple CarPlay compatibility."

This torquey engine provides plenty of low-end grunt to motivate the meaty mud-terrain tires, and this restored off-roader should have no troubles traversing harsh terrain but will look just as good rolling up to a local car show."
