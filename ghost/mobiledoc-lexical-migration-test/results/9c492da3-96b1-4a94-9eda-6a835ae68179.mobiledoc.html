<hr>
<p>If there's anything the last few years of rampant crime and Armageddon-like chaos on the street have taught us, the cops need some severe help dealing with criminals. While the police were once respected among communities of law-abiding citizens and feared by criminals, the institutions to protect and serve have become a laughing stock. Whether this is because of the cops themselves, the recent lack of respect for law enforcement, or just a lack of funding, it's clear that the police require a total brand overhaul. So the first step on the journey to reclaim their reputation for catching the bad guys and saving the day is to reshape their image; this might be the perfect way to start.

<p>The first thing you typically see when confronted with the long arm of the law is the cop cars swarming around you like a pack of wolves. Once, the infamous Dodge Charger pursuit halted criminals and amazed pedestrians, but there was a huge problem. The Chargers used by cops are either heavy 5.7-liter V8 or low-power V6s, making it difficult for anyone with a basic knowledge of cars to be afraid to run. Of course, those vehicles have the advantage of AWD, but there's another all-American performance car whose reputation is quite vibrant within cop culture. That car is the Ford Mustang.</p>

<p>The Ford Mustang was once one of the most feared police chasers around in the '80s and '90s but was eventually discontinued for use by law enforcement. Nowadays, Steeda has introduced a new Mustang deemed the Special Services Mustang for the Valdosta Police department. Along with the V8 engine, the cops have been given a bright white and blue livery, suspension upgrades, a tune, and a cold air intake. This all translates to a great performance car and the perfect vehicle to help the police reclaim their image of skill, honor, and general toughness in the face of adversity.</p>
