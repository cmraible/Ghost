<p>News of Russia invading Ukraine flooded our feeds late last week and left little room to focus on much else. And while it’s difficult to remember everything that preceded the Eastern European crisis unfolding before us, there were indeed other topics of conversation last week, including another noteworthy piece of news that traveled around the world: Monday’s passing of global health legend Dr. Paul Farmer. As we highlight below in this edition of Weekend Reader, back in 2000, <em>The New Yorker </em>published Tracy Kidder’s story about Farmer’s groundbreaking work treating AIDS and tuberculosis, among other symptoms of poverty. As Kidder noted in his now-iconic piece and <a href="https://www.tracykidder.com/mountains-beyond-mountains.html">follow-up book</a>, Farmer set an example for medical practitioners everywhere by approaching his practice with deep humility, equity, and in his own words, “pragmatic solidarity.”</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/07/10/the-good-doctor-2"><strong>The Good Doctor</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>“Zanmi Lasante is famous in the Central Plateau, in part for its medical director, Dr. Paul Farmer, known as Doktè Paul, or Polo, or, occasionally, Blan Paul. The women in Zanmi Lasante’s kitchen call him ti blan mwen — ‘my little white guy.’ Peasant farmers like to remember how, during the violent years of the coup that deposed President Aristide, the unarmed Doktè Paul faced down a soldier who tried to enter the complex carrying a gun. One peasant told me, ‘God gives everyone a gift, and his gift is healing.’ A former patient once declared, ‘I believe he is a god.’ It was also said, in whispers, ‘He works with both hands’ — that is, both with science and with the magic necessary to remove ensorcellments, to many Haitians the deep cause of illnesses. Most of the encomiums seem to embarrass and amuse Farmer. But this last has a painful side. The Haitian belief in illness sent by sorcery thrives on deprivation, on the long absence of effective medicine. Farmer has dozens of voodoo priests among his patients.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-an-explainer"><strong>Russia’s Invasion Of Ukraine: An Explainer</strong></a><strong></strong>(Jewish Currents) — <em>“Ukrainian civilians are hiding in basements, sheltering from air raids in metro stations, and attempting to flee to the west on jam-packed roads. Russia’s action constitutes the largest-scale invasion Europe has seen since World War II — or that the world has seen since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-25/russian-billionaire-jets-superyachts-roam-free-as-attack-rages?sref=w8mEqFdc"><strong>Russian Billionaire Jets and Superyachts Roam Free as Ukraine Attack Rages</strong></a><strong></strong>(Bloomberg) — “<em>Russia’s ultra-rich are among the biggest owners of private jets and superyachts, two of the most opulent displays of massive wealth. So far, even as the U.S. and U.K. have ramped up sanctions on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, these assets of the country’s elite — which can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars each — have avoided any direct hit.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/opinion/ukraine-russia-kyiv.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20220225&instance_id=54229&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=52260631&segment_id=83910&te=1&user_id=923392a7b51541e87d889d62d0130d1c"><strong>I’m in Kyiv, and It Is Terrifying</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“As I continued my walk, I saw people in all kinds of moods around me. Some of them were arguing while they waited their turn at the gas station. People were driving manically, and cars whizzed through the streets. Whenever there was a loud sound, people looked to the skies, fearing a Russian fighter jet. A young mother stood near her black Jeep, holding her daughter with one hand and talking on the phone. ‘Yes, mom, we are leaving. We are leaving!’ she screamed.”</em></li>

What Happens When They Disappear?</strong></a> (Grist) — <em>“For Midwesterners, winter has long been a point of pride. It is a region where people boast of surviving temperatures below zero before wind chill; where residents don’t just build snowmen, they build ice fishing shacks to drag onto frozen lakes; and where backyard hockey ponds can outnumber swimming pools… But climate change is altering winter in the Midwest, playing havoc with traditions. Warming temperatures here — as elsewhere — mean the loss of a way of life, of a culture that began generations ago and that many thought their children’s children would celebrate.”</em></li>

They didn’t realize they were amplifying a QAnon propaganda artist trying to convince the masses that President Donald Trump was saving the country from a ring of satanic pedophiles. And they didn’t know how dangerous child sex trafficking myths were about to become. That actual victims would be blocked from getting help. That women fearing traffickers would be driven to violence. And that the real children whose pictures were used in this ploy would have their lives upended.”</em></li>

Those audits, which have been suspended for the past two years, could lead to as many as 15 million people losing their health insurance, including 6 million children, according to an analysis from the Urban Institute.”</em></li>
