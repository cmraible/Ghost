<p>Despite rain casting a bit of a shadow over <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/2022-amelia-island/">Amelia Island</a> on Sunday, the crowds came out to bask in the beauty of the classics entered into this year’s Amelia Concours d’Elegance. After <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/five-quick-facts-about-the-pontiac-gto/">judging</a> concluded and the sun began peeking out from behind the cloud cover, a stunning 1935 Avions Voisin Type C25 Aerodyne captured the coveted 2023 Best in Show title.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking this Type C25 Aerodyne looks a bit familiar, there might be good reason for that feeling. Owners Merle and Peter Mullin purchased chassis 50010 in the early part of this century. The classic underwent a nut-and-bolt restoration over the period of three years. Not too long after that process was complete the Mullins entered it into the 2011 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance where it won Best of Show after wowing judges and attendees.</p>

<p>When the Type C25 Aerodyne was unveiled at the 1934 Paris Salon de l’Automobile it was hailed by Gabriel Voisin as “the car of the future.” Sleek and forward-thinking for its day, using lightweight allows for many parts, the timing of the release did the vehicle zero favors. A mere six were made before the drums of war began beating in Europe, bending automotive production toward the manufacturing of tanks, guns, and other battle implements. Thus, this classic is exceedingly rare, guaranteed to turn heads everywhere one appears.</p>
