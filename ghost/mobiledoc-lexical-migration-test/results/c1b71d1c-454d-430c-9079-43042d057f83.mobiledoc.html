<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This week, lawmakers <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-dems-vote-to-repeal-ad4/">voted</a> to defy New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and repeal a law shielding nursing home executives from legal consequences when their business decisions harm people. This is a HUGE victory, and top <a href="https://twitter.com/yuhline/status/1375178682118078472">lawmakers</a> credited our journalism for helping make it happen. One <a href="https://twitter.com/Biaggi4NY/status/1374950046618243072?s=20">lawmaker</a> even declared, “Repealing immunity would not have been possible without the articulate and excellent reporting” of <em>The Daily Poster.</em></p>
