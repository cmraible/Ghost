<p>Tonight at 7pm ET (4pm PT) is our weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a>, where David Sirota is joined by special guests to take questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
<p>This week, David will be discussing whether or not progressive Democrats will finally use their power to block Joe Manchin‚Äôs pipeline deal. As part of the negotiations to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, Manchin and Chuck Schumer struck a side deal which included ‚Äúpermitting reform‚Äù to accelerate the approval process for new oil pipelines. Now, that permitting provision will be attached to a continuing resolution to fund the government, setting up a potential government shutdown if progressives choose to block it.</p>
