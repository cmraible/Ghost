That’s the only rational explanation we can provide for why a Chevy Camaro driver was pulled over in North Las Vegas, Nevada twice in the same night, actually just moments apart, picking up two citations for reckless driving. Or maybe it’s just same people never learn at all."

The first time around, the guy was pulled over for doing 73 mph in a 35 mph zone. Just moments after being issued a reckless driving citation for more than doubling the speed limit, he was pulled over going 106 mph in a 35 mph zone."

We’ve seen too many fatal collisions because someone decided to blast through an intersection at speeds which would be scary even on a highway."

That means he’ll have fines for both citations, plus bail, and quite the impound fee to pay when he eventually gets out of the slammer. But the fun isn’t over there since he’ll need to appear before a judge, explain his actions, and possibly face even more consequences for his actions."
