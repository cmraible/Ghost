Today's newsletter is about my experience with the M1 Mac mini and why I've decided to return it and keep my older iMac Pro. The key takeaway? Benchmarks aren't everything.</p><p>By the way, this afternoon I recorded a new episode of TechieBytes with Jesse Chambers, founder &amp; CEO at <a href=\"https://wrkfrce.com\">wrkfrce</a>. The episode is all about the future of [remote] work and will be out next Tuesday! So stay tuned for that.
