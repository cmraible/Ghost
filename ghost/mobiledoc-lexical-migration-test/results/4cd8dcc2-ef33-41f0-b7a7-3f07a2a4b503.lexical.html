<p>Welcome to the Cheat Sheet, <em>The Lever’s</em> new weekly feature exclusively for our supporting subscribers that quickly gets you up to speed on a pressing news matter. Each week, we will show you exactly what you need to know — including vital information corporate media is trying to cheat you out of learning.</p>
<p>This week, we’re focused on student debt, a topic that sadly hits home for me and countless others who pursued an exorbitant college education and now daydream about financial freedom. President Joe Biden’s decision <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/06/1091018301/student-loan-pause-extended">last week</a> to sign off on a seventh repayment pause since the pandemic started has reignited the student loan cancellation debate, drawing out various opinions on the matter from all corners of the internet.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there is one truth that matters: Biden has the authority to do more than just pause student loan repayment, yet he’s been reluctant to do so, despite the broad appeal and notable benefits of opting for a permanent cancellation and moving toward making public colleges and universities free.</p>

<p><strong>NUTS AND BOLTS: </strong>Student loan debt in the U.S. <a href="https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics">has reached</a> $1.75 trillion, with more than 43 million<strong></strong>Americans having to repay federal student loans and <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-student-loan-payment">$460 payments</a> per month on average. Contrary to popular belief, the fastest-growing group of student debtors is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2019/05/22/the-growing-trend-of-retiree-student-loan-debt/?sh=13ff3b7046a4">seniors</a>, with those ages 60 to 69 owing $85 billion — many of whom have their social security garnished.</p>
<p>The interest borrowers have to pay on their federal loans can be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2022/03/24/biden-should-permanently-abolish-student-loan-interest-says-key-senator/?sh=7f47b6877786">crippling</a>, since it translates to borrowers owing much more over time than what they originally did when they entered repayment.</p>
<p>Student loans are one of the greatest contributors to household debt. <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2022/demo/sehsd-wp2022-09.pdf">New data</a> from the U.S. Census Bureau show people with student debt have less access to equity-generating debt — think mortgages and business loans — and greater difficulty paying off non-equity-generating debt, like credit card and medical debt.</p>
<p><strong>BIDEN’S EMPTY PROMISES:</strong> When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which paused student loan payments through September 30, 2020. Former President Trump extended the moratorium on federal student loan payments another three months. <br></p>
<p>On the campaign trail, President Biden — who has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-and-student-debt-a-40-year/">long been a fan</a> of student debt — promised to immediately forgive $10,000 in student debt for every borrower, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1241869418981920769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1241869418981920769%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2021%2F12%2F07%2F1062070001%2Fstudent-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise">declaring</a>: “Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn’t happen again.” He <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/student-debt-cancelation-biden-campaign-promise-public-college-hbcu-2021-4">furthermore pledged</a> to forgive federal student loan debt for borrowers who attended public colleges and universities earning up to $125,000 a year, as well as those who attended historically Black colleges and universities. <br></p>
<p>Biden has failed to fulfill either of these promises, despite his <a href="https://twitter.com/whstancil/status/1514331363247280133?t=tu7hvJm94VdYq9IXVG2I2A&s=19">waning support among young voters</a> and the proposals’ <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/ag4e883md3/econToplines.pdf">political popularity</a>: Nearly half of all Americans, and 70 percent of Democrats, support forgiving student loan debt from public colleges and universities. And <a href="https://protectborrowers.org/new-poll-as-joe-biden-addresses-the-nation-voters-of-color-overwhelmingly-support-action-to-cancel-student-debt-extend-pause-on-student-loan-payments/">70 percent of Black likely voters</a> and 76 percent of Latino voters support the government canceling some to all student debt.<br></p>
<p>While many lawmakers <a href="https://twitter.com/thereidout/status/1511859035531878401?t=8R3m5f2kicSOhYvwW7kOTw&s=19">have</a><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Final%20-%20Letter%20to%20Biden%20Cancelling%20Student%20Loan%20Debt.pdf">urged</a> Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower through executive action, he has refused to do so, opting instead to continue the pandemic pause on federal student loan payments — <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1511803430607761416?t=20Wkk9rfHABaQsOZGTfcXw&s=19">most recently until August 31</a> — and punting to Congress to take bolder action on the matter. Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-review-executive-authority-cancel-student-debt-n1262791">previously asked</a> the secretary of education to explore his legal authority to cancel student loan debt, but the full memo has been hidden from public view.</p>
<p><strong>MATTY’S MYTHOLOGY, DEBUNKED: </strong>Yesterday, <em>The Hill</em> published a conservative <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3264278-student-loan-forgiveness-is-welfare-for-middle-and-upper-classes/">opinion piece</a> claiming: “Student loan forgiveness is welfare for middle and upper classes.” The column argued that blanket student loan forgiveness would have “severe economic impacts at the expense of working taxpayers — including minority and blue-collar workers, who would be forced to foot the massive bill.”</p>
<p>It’s a take that has gained steam among right-wing pundits and neoliberals. Economic blogger Matthew Yglesias this week <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1513634741735596035">tweeted</a> that it’s false to claim student debt cancellation would “disproportionately benefit Americans at the lower end of the economic scale.” His perspective is part of a larger trend of arguing that canceling student loan debt is a lefty ploy to aid the wealthy and shift the discussion squarely into the realm of means-testing: the practice of using someone’s financial status to determine their access to social benefits. Means-testing has long been weaponized against the working class in the form of <a href="https://policy-perspectives.org/2021/02/12/the-broken-bridge-out-of-poverty-the-cliff-effect/">income eligibility cutoffs</a> and <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RI_StudentDebtCancellation_IssueBrief_202106.pdf">would be counterproductive and inefficient</a> in the case of student loan debt cancellation. As Ryan Cooper once <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/694240/road-hell-paved-meanstesting">wrote</a> for <em>The Week</em>, “The road to hell is paved with means-testing.”</p>
<p>But as economic sociologist <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlieEatonPhD/status/1513675534806372353?s=20&t=PLAskmiwpMqVRRy3fDMBhA">Charlie Eaton</a> discovered in his research for the Roosevelt Institute, which makes for insightful <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RI_StudentDebtCancellation_IssueBrief_202106.pdf">bedtime reading</a>, the idea that canceling student debt is regressive because “it involves a public transfer to a relatively well-off group” is simply a myth.</p>
<p>Instead, the data <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RI_StudentDebtCancellation_IssueBrief_202106.pdf">show</a> such a move would actually be <em>progressive</em>, offering more benefits to people with fewer economic resources, including many <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/04/03/black-women-student-loan-freeze/">Black Americans</a> who’ve long suffered the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/student-loan-debt-has-a-lasting-effect-on-black-borrowers-despite-the-latest-freeze-in-payments">wealth gap-widening effects</a> of systemic racism. The study finds that critics’ views on the subject are riddled with misleading “empirical and conceptual errors.”</p>
<p>For example, the report calls out critics for including private student loans in reports about student loan debt cancellation, when current cancellation plans only target federal student loans. <br></p>
<h3 id="key-quote">KEY QUOTE</h3>
<p><em>“Today, financial predators, aided by allies in Washington from both parties, target borrowers who come from marginalized backgrounds, lack intergenerational wealth, and face wage discrimination on the job, ensuring lifetimes of repayment while compounding social inequities and racial disparities. The rich, meanwhile, can use credit to their advantage: Individuals walk away from their obligations (Donald Trump, the self-professed ‘king of debt,’ epitomizes this warped paradigm), and companies engage in strategic defaults.” <br></em></p>
<p>— Astra Taylor, co-founder of The Debt Collective, in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/opinion/student-loan-medical-debt-forgiveness.html">op-ed</a> for <em>The New York Times</em> titled “Make Americans’ Crushing Debt Disappear”<br></p>
<h3 id="vital-stat">VITAL STAT</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/student-debt-forgiveness-options-implications-for-policy-and-racial-equity/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, canceling up to $50,000 of student loan debt per borrower would immediately increase Black Americans’ wealth by 40 percent.<br></p>
<h3 id="flashback">FLASHBACK</h3>
<p>In his first year as governor of California, Ronald Reagan <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/02/03/15-trillion-student-loan-debt-sabotaging-nations-future">ended free tuition</a> at the University of California and made a 20 percent across-the-board cut to state aid for the UC college system. When he became president in 1981, he nationalized the fight against an educated America and the federal aid needed to make it happen. Reagan said America “should not subsidize intellectual curiosity.”</p>
<p>His policy actions as president in the early 1980s sparked widespread student debt across the country — the effects of which millions of Americans are still experiencing today.</p>
