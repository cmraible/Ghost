<p>Last Friday, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration released the specifics of its highly-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which would require large businesses to mandate that their employees either get vaccinated or wear masks and undergo weekly testing.</p>
<p>The new rule has sparked backlash from those who say it represents an infringement on personal freedom. But those supportive of vaccine mandates are also criticizing the rule — for being far too weak.</p>

<p>“American journalism is a class institution serving the rich and spurning the poor.” — Upton Sinclair in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54850.The_Brass_Check"><em>The Brass Check</em></a>, one of the first structural critiques of U.S. media. Sinclair self-published the book in 1919, a time of heightened disdain for newspapers run by business tycoons and conservative editors. <em>The Brass Check</em> sold more than 150,000 copies, despite being denounced by critics.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-news">TODAY’S NEWS:</h3>
<p>Last Friday, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) released its emergency temporary standard for COVID-19 vaccination and testing, the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/05/2021-23643/covid-19-vaccination-and-testing-emergency-temporary-standard">framework</a> for its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/somehow-there-are-still-no-safety-standards/">highly-anticipated</a> COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The rule, set to take full effect on January 4, would require businesses with 100 or more workers to mandate that their employees either get vaccinated or wear masks and undergo weekly testing.</p>
<p>The mandate has sparked backlash from those who say it represents an infringement on personal freedom. Twenty-seven states launched lawsuits in federal court over the OSHA requirement, and on Saturday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-mandate-halted-osha-appeals-court/">temporarily halted</a> the rule.</p>
<p>But those supportive of vaccine mandates are also criticizing the rule — for being too weak.</p>
<p>“This thing is so weak… I am not sure it will have much of an effect if it goes into effect,” said Dr. Justin Feldman, a social epidemiologist and fellow with Harvard’s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights. “You can just sign a form claiming you're vaccinated and the employer can choose to believe you under the rule.”</p>
<p>While the rule requires that employers maintain proof of employee vaccination status and lists acceptable proofs of vaccination, it also notes, “In instances where an employee is unable to produce acceptable proof of vaccination… a signed and dated statement by the employee will be acceptable.”</p>
<p>While Feldman noted that potential criminal penalties for providing false information might dissuade some vaccine-opposed employees from fabricating such statements, he added that enforcement of the rule’s specifics could be challenging.</p>
<p>In a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jfeldman_epi/status/1457137423696207881?s=20">thread</a>, Feldman expressed another concern: While the mandate requires qualifying workers who test positive for the virus to be isolated, it does not require their employers pay them during their absence. “Putting the cost of testing and isolation on the worker will incentivize workers to lie,” noted Feldman, adding that this arrangement could encourage unvaccinated employees to take advantage of the signed-and-dated statement loophole to avoid risking weekly tests and potential quarantine.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Jordan Barab, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for OSHA, is less concerned. “I think obviously there’s going to be some leakage in this thing no matter what,” Barab told<em> The Daily Poster</em>. “But I think the vast majority of employers and employees will comply.”</p>
<p>OSHA <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA4162.pdf">estimates</a> that its new rule will result in about 23 million more Americans becoming vaccinated, saving over 6,500 lives and preventing over 250,000 hospitalizations. But critics argue that a more robust mandate could have greater impact.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the same week OSHA released its vaccine mandate, the country reported 8,516 new deaths from COVID-19.</p>

<p>On May 3, 2021, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) spearheaded a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000179-5df9-d7df-a37d-fffb8de30000">letter</a> to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressing opposition about H.R. 3, Democrats’ <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/">wildly popular</a> legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices and green light other pharmaceutical pricing reforms to save taxpayers billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Just one day later, Peters raked in nearly $19,000 in campaign cash from pharmaceutical industry CEOs and lobbyists. So far this year, Peters has received $128,000 from donors in the pharmaceutical and health products industry, according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/scott-peters/industries?cid=N00033591&cycle=2022">OpenSecrets</a> — the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?cycle=2022&ind=H04">most</a> of any House Democrat.</p>
<p>In 2019, Peters <a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-peters-votes-to-pass-bill-to-lower-prescription-drug-prices-secures">supported</a> Democrats’ drug pricing bill. Now, he’s helped the drug industry <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/building-back-america/drug-price-tax-break-quid-pro-quo/">significantly gut</a> the measure.</p>

    <li><strong>TRUMP OFFICIALS USED TAXPAYER MONEY FOR REELECTION:</strong> An Office of Special Counsel (OSC) <a href="https://osc.gov/Documents/Hatch%20Act/Reports/Investigation%20of%20Political%20Activities%20by%20Senior%20Trump%20Administration%20Officials%20During%20the%202020%20Presidential%20Election.pdf">report</a> recently found that at least 13 senior Trump administration staffers repeatedly violated the Hatch Act — a U.S. law meant to restrict partisan political activity by federal workers — by using taxpayer dollars to promote then-President Trump’s reelection in 2020. The report <a href="https://www.axios.com/trumps-taxpayer-funded-hatch-act-13-f2cc1a45-163b-4c3d-b967-bff294478534.html">highlights</a> how weaknesses in the Hatch Act constrained OSC’s ability to prosecute these violations. “OSC is asking Congress for new powers to ensure Trump remains an outlier,” <em>Axios</em> reporter Lachlan Markay <a href="https://twitter.com/lachlan/status/1458133598574452737">tweeted</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>OKLAHOMA COULD LOCK CONSUMERS INTO GAS UTILITIES: </strong>Oklahoma Natural Gas, the state’s largest natural gas utility, plans on <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oklahoma-natural-gas-utility-exit-fee-proposal_n_618599a2e4b0c8666bdcc491?05">charging customers</a> nearly $1,400 to switch to electric stoves and heating. The “exit fee,” which is currently under review at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, could go into effect by next June. “The fee could more than double the cost of swapping a gas stove for a new electric appliance, forcing homeowners offloading their last gas appliance to not only purchase the new one but also to bid the utility farewell by paying out the remainder of their share of the company’s debt,” <em>HuffPost </em>reported.</li>

    <li><strong>DEMOCRATS CUT UNIVERSAL PRE-K IN HALF: </strong>The <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR5376RH-RCP117-18.pdf">revised</a> universal pre-k proposal in Democrats’ social spending reconciliation package is <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/11/09/the-incredible-shrinking-pre-k-plan">far weaker</a> than the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text">version</a> introduced in September. The earlier policy ensured the federal government would cover the full cost of state-administered universal pre-k for the program’s first three years. After that, the federal government’s cost obligation would decrease by 10 percent yearly, and it would ultimately cover just 60 percent of the program’s cost in 2028. The current draft significantly pares back the earlier proposal by eliminating the final year of financial support and nixing the federal government’s responsibility to pick up the full tab in the first three years — giving state governors fodder to avoid implementing the program. According to the People’s Policy Project, “For all practical purposes, the universal pre-k bill has been cut in half: the last year was cut entirely and the first three years have such little money appropriated towards them that they basically don’t exist.”</li>
    <li><strong>FLAWED DATA UNDERLIES COUNTRIES’ CLIMATE PLEDGES: </strong>A new <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/greenhouse-gas-emissions-pledges-data/">investigation</a> finds several countries, including China, Russia, and the U.S., underreport their greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations. An analysis of 196 country reports reveals a massive gap between individual nations’ declared and actual greenhouse gas emissions, potentially impacting the type of climate action and goals currently being discussed at COP26. “The gap ranges from at least 8.5 billion to as high as 13.3 billion tons a year of underreported emissions — big enough to move the needle on how much the Earth will warm,” the <em>Post </em>reports.</li>
    <li><strong>DNR PATIENTS RECEIVE LESS ROUTINE CARE: </strong>Patients with do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders experience higher death rates for unrelated illnesses because the U.S. health care system tapers off routine care for such patients, according to a recent <a href="https://www.e7health.com/articles/6/dnr-orders-can-lead-to-worse-care-increase-death-rates/">e7Health study</a>. Typically, a person signs a DNR order to prevent resuscitation in the event their breathing or heart stops. While this option works to bypass unnecessary suffering at the end of a person’s life, the study, which examines 20 years of peer-reviewed data from leading medical institutions, finds that patients often agree to a DNR without knowing the order could make hospitals less likely to administer blood tests, IVs, and routine procedures that could extend their life. Signing such a DNR could “makes things go in a direction that we probably didn’t want to happen,” said e7Health CEO Jonathan Baktari, MD. “Our standard way of looking at DNR is appropriate in many cases, but not all.”<br></li>
