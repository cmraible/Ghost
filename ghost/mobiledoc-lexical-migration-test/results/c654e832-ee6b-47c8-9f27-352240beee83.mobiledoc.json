Transferring that power is a gated five-speed manual transaxle which helps to spin the wheels. Wild and high-speed driving is assisted by sporty tires. Looking at the car’s exterior you’ll find the impactful Rosso Corsa finish which is perfectly complemented by the stunning leather interior. Spirited driving is a very obvious focus for the creators of this vehicle with the Targa top giving you the freedom to feel the wind on your face as you hit the 150mph top speed."
