<p>There is one generation of Corvette that has been largely slept on throughout the years for one reason or another. As you might already know, that generation was the fourth which started production in 1984. Pretty much everything from the early to late 1980s is pretty much slept on these days. However there is a growing base of fans for cars like this. Unfortunately this Corvette is a prime example of the consequences that come with neglecting a vehicle.</p>

<p>When we first see the car it’s easy to immediately notice the flaws and its character. Covered in rust, the bodies beaten to hell, and it definitely doesn’t run and drive. It would appear that this Corvette was used, abused, and abandoned, sad sight for car people everywhere. However, when you look under the hood you’ll notice a pretty great looking 350 in.³ V8 engine and as you examine the interior it’s clear to see that it’s not in as terrible shape as you might expect.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like this C4 Corvette could be a really good great road car for any enthusiast willing to keep up with it. At least that’s what it always could’ve been before ending up in the boneyard. Along with it since the third gen Firebird as well which is a particularly saddening site for any American enthusiast who knows their stuff. However, there is always hope even in the case of beaten up and rusty old classics that have been abused and left to rot. It’s possible that someone will come save the car from its eventual demise and we might get a chance to look at the beautiful Corvette back on the road sometime soon.</p>
