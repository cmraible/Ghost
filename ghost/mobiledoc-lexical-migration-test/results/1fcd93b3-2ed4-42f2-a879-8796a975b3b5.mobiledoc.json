Professional drivers have called the Porsche 997 GT3 RS 4.0 a wicked track weapon since it has both explosive power and razor-sharp handling, a combination which is downright lethal. This example has only 2,300 miles on the clock, and is available now for the Porsche collector who wants to round out their collection."
