Firstly, it undermines its own core concept with the ubiquitous use of the word “game.” Contextualising everything under the umbrella of video games removes a lot of the seriousness of the story, and the story takes itself very seriously. The main character is portrayed as a hardboiled, tough as nails detective, but his profession is that he goes into video games and deals with trolls and game addicts. It makes the game seem silly, and this would not be an issue if the game was self-aware, but it is most definitely not. "

All this does is open more dialogue options. While I like that this will open up certain doors, acquire new information, or find that hidden item in the map, at the end of the day, there is no skill required in this. There is no check to pass; there is no challenge to overcome; if you have the job, you can do the thing. This can lead to a player looking up the most efficient way to acquire the necessary points to get every job the fastest, then swagger their way through anything the game throws at them because nothing is blocked off. Personally, I find this off-putting because it removes a lot of the risk of failure. You either cannot select an option, or you succeed in it; there’s no third choice. "
