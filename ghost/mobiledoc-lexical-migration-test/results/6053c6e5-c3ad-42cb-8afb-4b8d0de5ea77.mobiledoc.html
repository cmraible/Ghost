<p>Anyone into Chevrolet performance, even just casually, has bumped into Lingenfelter Performance Engineering. It’s pretty much impossible to not since the Michigan-based tuner has been tweaking Chevrolet Corvettes, Camaros, and more for almost five decades. Now the company has a crazy plan to squeeze the mighty LT4 into GM’s midsize pickup truck.</p>
<p>This serious upgrade isn’t ready for the Chevy Colorado or GMC Canyon yet. When it is ready, the performance upswing is going to be huge. After all, the LT4 is a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 pumping out 650-horsepower. That’s a big difference from the optional 3.6-liter V6 you can get from the factory, an engine Lingenfelter has been offering a supercharger package for, boosting output to about 450-hp.</p>

<p>In case you don’t know, the LT4 is the engine used in the Chevy Camaro ZL1 as well as the C7 Corvette ZO6 and the final Cadillac CTS-V. All three cars are known for their brutal acceleration and ability to smoke tires like mad, so you can just imagine what a Colorado with the same engine could do.</p>
<p>On top of that impressive factory performance from the LT4, Lingenfelter has a pulley upgrade package which will boost the V8 to 720-hp. Since Lingenfelter was showing off an upgraded Colorado with the pulley package installed, we feel pretty comfortable in speculating this option will be made available to the public.</p>
<p>The factory transmission can’t handle this huge power increase, so Lingenfelter says it swapped in the 8-speed transmission used for the LT4. The factory-integrated BCM calibration is also included. In the video below, the Colorado is shown with its rear wheels on a dyno’s rollers, so at least this one example is two-wheel drive. It’s definitely possible a four-wheel-drive version of this upgrade won’t be offered, but we’ll have to wait and see on that.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, squeezing such a large engine into a smaller truck isn’t exactly easy. Lingenfelter turned to Current Performance for help and the two companies got it done. This project is still a work in progress, so Lingenfelter isn’t offering LT4 swaps yet, although it looks like that will be happening soon.</p>
