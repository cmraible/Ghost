Adding to that chorus is the first-ever dealership in the world to only sell Mercedes electric cars. That’s right, the Mercedes-EQ brand has broken away from the mainstream Mercedes lineup, allowing shoppers and owners in Yokohama, Japan to not have to frequent a building where dirty ICE vehicles are sold and serviced."

Staff concentrate only on EVs, which supposedly will prevent them from talking shoppers into an ICE model instead. What’s more, the roof is covered in solar panels and there are vehicle chargers."

Apparently, Mercedes believes it can capitalize on that. Unfortunately, Japanese consumers are far more loyal to Japanese brands than imports, so the Germans are likely facing another uphill battle."

Plus, Mercedes was the top foreign brand in the country for 2021. If we see the Mercedes-EQ dealership model spread throughout Japan and elsewhere in the world, we’ll know it’s probably a success. Otherwise, this venture will quietly go away as the company hopes everyone forgets it ever existed."
