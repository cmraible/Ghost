<p>Good things are happening! American Rescue Plan Act funds are being put to work for homes and teachers. In Pennsylvania, residents are getting much needed funding for home improvements. Across the country, public schools are offering big signing bonuses to hire much needed teachers amid severe shortages. Also, Uber and Lyft drivers in California have organized and secured workplace and health protections for the first time ever. Meanwhile, Chipotle workers just won a major settlement.</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=1135">Whole Home Repair</a><a href="https://shelterforce.org/2022/08/05/in-pa-bill-aims-to-help-homeowners-pay-for-costly-home-repairs/">program</a> will use $125 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to help Pennsylvanians fix their homes. Philadelphia in <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2022/08/05/in-pa-bill-aims-to-help-homeowners-pay-for-costly-home-repairs/">particular</a> has some of the oldest houses in the country, and an estimated 280,000 occupied units in Pennsylvania have moderate to severe physical deficiencies.</p>
<p>In an effort to prevent low and moderate-income homeowners from having to relocate, they will be able to use up to $50,000 to repair anything from leaking pipes to cracked ceilings. Funds will go toward training workers and helping homeowners afford <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-legislature-home-repair-assistance-program-bipartisan/">weatherization</a> improvements to make homes more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>The program also aims to <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/gop-legislators-are-backing-philly-dems-housing-bill-why-blight-is-a-statewide-issue/">tackle gentrification</a> by helping homeowners catch up on costly repairs so that they don’t feel pressure to sell to developers targeting their homes. The program is slated to be <a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/community-development/reports/measuring-and-understanding-home-repair-costs/111919-home-repair-spotlight.pdf">especially helpful</a> for <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/commentary/whole-home-repair-law-is-proof-lawmakers-can-work-together-when-they-want-to-ray-e-landis/">older</a> Pennsylvanians who may own homes but lack the income to maintain them.</p>
<p>Though the program is a one-time round of funding, organizers and representatives are <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2022/08/05/in-pa-bill-aims-to-help-homeowners-pay-for-costly-home-repairs/">working</a> on making it part of a long-term strategy to address housing. “We know we have a multi-billion dollar problem on our hand, and we have $125 million of one-time funding. So, we really have to treat this as a pilot program,” <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-07-14/pennsylvania-home-repair-program">said</a> Democratic state Rep. Sara Innamorato.</p>
<h3 id="signing-bonuses-for-teachers">Signing Bonuses For Teachers</h3>
<p>As public schools across the country face a severe <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teacher-shortage-schools-low-pay-burnout-incentives/">teacher shortage</a>, ARPA funds are being used to <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-become-a-teacher-you-could-land-a-25k-signing-bonus/">provide</a> competitive signing bonuses to new hires. Taos, New Mexico, is <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-become-a-teacher-you-could-land-a-25k-signing-bonus/">promising</a> a $50,000 starting salary for every new teacher hired, with an additional $10,000 signing bonus. Similarly, a $10,000 signing bonus is being offered by <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-become-a-teacher-you-could-land-a-25k-signing-bonus/">Stanly County Schools</a> in North Carolina.</p>
<h3 id="florida-enacts-its-strongest-climate-policy-in-over-a-decade">Florida Enacts Its Strongest Climate Policy In Over A Decade</h3>
<p>On Tuesday, Florida’s new law to transition the state to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 went into effect. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/08/1116264207/young-activists-have-pushed-florida-to-set-clean-energy-goals">Youth activists</a> fought hard to make this climate action a reality. About 200 young Floridians worked with the public interest law firm Our Children’s Trust to petition for new rulemaking, which pushed the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571d109b04426270152febe0/t/626182b377d1f9066c8f7dd1/1650557619724/04.21.2022.FDACS+Proposed+Rule.pdf">propose</a> these goals in April.</p>
<h3 id="workplace-protections-extended-to-gig-workers">Workplace Protections Extended To Gig Workers</h3>
<p>California’s workplace safety <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/Uber-Lyft-facing-fines-for-failing-to-provide-17362972.php">regulators cited</a> Uber and Lyft for safety violations, including their failure to provide masks and gloves to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and for excluding drivers from general injury and illness prevention plans.</p>
<p>Rideshare Drivers United, a group of Lyft and Uber drivers who have organized to demand full labor rights, launched a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/lyft-drivers-protest-ride-sharing-as-pandemic-continues/">campaign</a> for health protections during a COVID surge in February. After their petition was rejected, they filed the complaints with state regulators, which resulted in this victory.</p>
<p>“This is the first time that a state safety agency has extended workplace protections to gig workers, and challenges the companies’ (claim) that they have no responsibility to ensure safety of drivers,” Rideshare Drivers United <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/Uber-Lyft-facing-fines-for-failing-to-provide-17362972.php">said</a> in a statement. “Lyft and Uber are again breaking the law by not notifying drivers about these citations, as required under California law.”</p>

<h3 id="chipotle-workers-win-settlement-money">Chipotle Workers Win Settlement Money</h3>
<p>13,000 Chipotle workers <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/8/9/23298731/chipotle-pay-nyc-workers-20-million-violate-workplace-protections">will</a> receive $20 million in settlement money after a four-year investigation by New York City's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) found Chipotle to be in violation of workplace protection laws around fair scheduling and paid sick leave.</p>
<p>“This almost feels unreal. When you’re in the thick of it, like going to work each day and going through the motions, you think no one is paying attention,” Chipotle worker Yeral Martinez <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/8/9/23298731/chipotle-pay-nyc-workers-20-million-violate-workplace-protections">said</a> in a statement. “But this settlement proves that we’re not invisible. Companies can’t treat their workers as disposable. We are worthy of respect, dignity, and fair schedules!”</p>
<p>The DCWP had calculated that 6,500 employees were owed about $150 million — “approximately $23,061.00 relief owed per affected employee.” While this week’s settlement falls far short of that estimate, Chipotle workers are <a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/05/chipotle-workers-fair-workweek-law-nyc">continuing</a> to <a href="https://civileats.com/2021/12/07/an-inside-look-at-union-organizing-in-the-fast-food-industry/">organize</a> for more, working with <a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/chipotle-workers-union/">local</a> 32BJ-Service Employees International Union as they seek greater protections. Just last month, a Chipotle location near Lansing, Michigan, <a href="https://www.nrn.com/fast-casual/workers-michigan-chipotle-mexican-grill-petition-organize-union-affiliation-teamsters">petitioned</a> for a union.</p>

<p><strong>Finally…</strong></p>
<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Mary Oliver’s poem on amazing moments, “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/41917/breakage">Breakage</a>”:</p>
<p><em>I go down to the edge of the sea.</em></p>
<p><em>How everything shines in the morning light!</em></p>
<p><em>The cusp of the whelk,</em></p>
<p><em>the broken cupboard of the clam,</em></p>
<p><em>the opened, blue mussels,</em></p>
<p><em>moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred—</em></p>
<p><em>and nothing at all whole or shut, but tattered, split,</em></p>
<p><em>dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone.</em></p>
<p><em>It's like a schoolhouse</em></p>
<p><em>of little words,</em></p>
<p><em>thousands of words.</em></p>
<p><em>First you figure out what each one means by itself,</em></p>
<p><em>the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop</em></p>
<p><em>full of moonlight.</em></p>
<p><em>Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.</em></p>
