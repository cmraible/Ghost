That’s how we feel about Junkyard Digs buying a couple of AMC Eagles to have one complete wagon, then taking that rugged beast to a Jeep park to see what it can do. Despite what some in the Jeep crowd might tend to believe, there are other vehicles which can take on rugged terrain, but an AMC Eagle might be pushing it a bit."

These of course had a unibody construction instead of the body-on-frame setup so common on off-road trucks up to that point. What’s more, they sported an independent front suspension, making them quite comfortable for on-road use."

The thing is literally a rattle trap and is leaking oil, so pushing the envelope on an off-road course doesn’t really sound like a great idea. However, pretty much any entertaining YouTube video involves at least one element of a bad idea, if not several."

Yes, that’s right, there are still some amazing deals to be had out there, despite the microchip shortage, but you have to know where and how to look. Also, you might have to be willing to buy cars which require some assembly."
