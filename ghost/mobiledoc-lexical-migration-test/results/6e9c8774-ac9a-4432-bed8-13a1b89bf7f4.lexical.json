Its colourfully lighthearted aesthetic and adorable protagonist breathes fresh air into the grittiness that came come with dungeon crawlers. The inspirations from 2D <em>Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> games are clear and they mesh together wonderfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This game required MX$420,000 and it is currently sitting at MX$1,192,557.73 after 1,823 backers with 20 days remaining.
