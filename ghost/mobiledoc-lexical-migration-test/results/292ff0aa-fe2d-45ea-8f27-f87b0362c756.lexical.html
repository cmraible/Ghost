<p><strong>Corvette Driver Shot For Not Street Racing</strong></p>
<p>We all know street racing is dangerous, not only for those who engage in such activities but also for others on the road. For those and more reasons, many people just won’t participate in a street race and that’s supposed to keep everyone safe. Only that wasn’t the case back in October.</p>
<p>A man in his 2005 Chevy Corvette was shot in the early morning hours in Memphis, Tennessee by some men in a New Edge Mustang. The reason was that the Corvette driver didn’t want to race.</p>
<p>It’s truly a bizarre story you can read <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-driver-shot/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Street Racers Kill 11-Year-Old Girl</strong></p>
<p>It’s always horrific when someone dies in a street race, but it’s even worse when that someone is an innocent bystander. The fact that an 11-year-old girl riding in the backseat of a Toyota RAV4 was killed when a 17-year-old racing in a Kia Optima plowed into the back end of the crossover was something we found particularly disturbing.</p>
<p>The other street racing kid was driving a Dodge Charger and reportedly both teens were more concerned about the damage to their precious vehicles than the fact a child was dead and the two adults in the front seat of the Toyota were seriously injured. Selfish doesn’t even begin to describe their attitude.</p>
