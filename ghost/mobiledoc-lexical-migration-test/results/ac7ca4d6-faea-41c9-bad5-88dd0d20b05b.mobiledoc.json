Lifting the soft tonneau cover reveals tubbed rear wheel wells, the relocated battery box and a sizeable fuel cell. Inside, this pro-street S-10 blends factory-style cloth bucket seats with functional racing components such as the Grant steering wheel, a monster-sized AutoMeter tachometer and a B&M shifter. About the only thing missing to make this a true drag truck is a roll cage."

That's where you'll find a monster 496 cubic-inch big-block V8 that has been built up with aluminum heads, roller rockers, MSD ignition and an Edelbrock Performer intake topped with 850 cfm four-barrel carb. This engine's 650 horsepower is sent to those wide rear tires through a Ford nine-inch Detroit Locker rear end, and while this S-10 is perfectly set up for the drag strip, it's still 100 percent street legal!"
