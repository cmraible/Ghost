If you amplify that excitement by 175 you get this huge barn find located in a warehouse in London. Row upon row of dingy BMWs, Porsches, Mercedes-Benzes, Volkswagens, and more are being readied for sale. Thanks to a the included video, you get a walking tour of the facility and a look at some of the cars contained in the amazing collection."

It’s a sad reality, but hopefully there’s no serious damage."
