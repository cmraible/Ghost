But, as the video of a Camaro kissing a power pole proves, there are plenty of morons who choose the bowtie or a Mopar. That’s right, stupidity behind the wheel knows no brand loyalty."

Maybe he didn’t care. Or maybe he’s just not that good at showing off in a rear-wheel-drive performance machine. Actually, we know that’s the case because of what happens next."

After blasting past the buddy’s Dodge Charger parked on the sidewalk and a GMC Sierra headed the opposite direction, the rear of the Camaro breaks loose. The driver obviously doesn’t know how to throttle steer out of that, so he ends up kissing the power pole, backing up the support cable. Maybe he was hoping for a hybrid gas-electric Camaro? We’re just glad the buddy decided to share the video, but someone needs to figure out where this happened and send it to the police department. We’re sure they’ll get a kick out it."
