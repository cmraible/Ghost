Considering automakers have been dragging out and reheating the corpses of legendary models, some good and some bad, this is certainly a possibility, although it would definitely be a limited-edition vehicle with a pretty small production run. Think something along the lines of the new Lamborghini Countach."

It seems pretty out there, but sure it’s possible."
