<p>With the exception of a Summit Racing tachometer discreetly mounted to the right of the steering column, the interior appears to be in its stock form. A vintage looking stereo tries hard to fool the untrained eye into believing it is not a modern piece with a modern sound. Whether you are looking for a muscle car to add to your collection or one to jump-start it, this <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/472/1966-chevrolet-chevelle-malibu">1966 Chevelle</a> would be outstanding and with its restomod upgrades, it would also make an excellent daily driver. After all, <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/472/1966-chevrolet-chevelle-malibu">Chevrolet</a> made these cars to be driven and adding a few modern advancements to the mix is only going to make that drive better.</p>
