<hr>
<p>Enthusiasts seem to be pretty split on the C8 Corvette’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-192-mph/">straight-line acceleration performance</a>. That’s true even among the Corvette faithful. Some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-z06-record/">are impressed</a> with just about every eighth-mile and quarter-mile run posted on the internet while others find the mid-engine sports car doesn’t offer the kind of blistering acceleration they would’ve liked.</p>
<p><strong>See how a C8 Corvette did a good impression of a bowling ball <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-bowling-ball/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>With that in mind, we wanted to share this video uploaded to YouTube by Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds. It shows a 2022 Chevy Corvette Z51 doing a standing one mile run. The test is performed at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds, which are located at Space Florida’s Launch and Landing Facility that’s at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Most of you are at least somewhat familiar with the facility.</p>
<p>Even though the test was done back on February 18, the video wasn’t uploaded until May 1. It also hasn’t achieved much more than 15,000 views as of the writing of this article, so it’s not getting much attention.</p>
<p>In case you’re not aware, a C8 Corvette with the Z51 package gains a few performance-oriented upgrades like an electronic limited-slip diff, Brembo brakes, and a performance exhaust system. Since the package isn’t horribly expensive and it comes with features some might argue should be standard on any Stingray, quite a few enthusiasts add it to their car.</p>
<p>Add to that the 6.2-liter V8 pumping out 495-horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque. Through an 8-speed automatic, that power is sent a short distance to the rear wheels. Also, the car in question tips the scale at 3,534 lbs. so it’s not exactly a porker, even if powertrain output isn’t mind-blowing for this decade.</p>
<p>In the end, the C8 Z51 Corvette posted a top speed of 169.179 mph after two runs. Check it out for yourself.</p>
