<p><a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/2012-chevrolet-camaro-copo">Modern Chevy</a> technology can be some of the best performance innovations available in the current automotive market. This is due to many reasons, but the main one is the incredible heritage which left big shoes to fill in modern times. Many examples of this consistent betterment of vehicular design can be found in the production models, but one variation makes it even more evident. We're talking about the COPO program, which has seen some of the fastest Chevrolet vehicles roll off the production line since the late 1960s. 53 years later, the COPO program still makes headlines, as can be seen with this particular example currently in the market for a driver. </p>
