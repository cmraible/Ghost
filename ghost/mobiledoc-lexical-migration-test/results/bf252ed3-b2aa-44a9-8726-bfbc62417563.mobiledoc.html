<p>The Robert Sedivy Auction is selling some great touring bikes this weekend - register to bid now. If you’re looking for a quality motorcycle, whether a modern or vintage model, this is a great chance to find one like these three featured touring motorcycles.</p>
<p><strong>Check out the new 500 Festival Camaros <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/500-festival-camaros/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>First up is a <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/2010-Yamaha-Star-XV-1900/lotInformation/75268334">2010 Yamaha Star XV 1900</a> with just 85 miles on its odometer. That helps explain why this bike looks so perfect with the black paint and chrome looking excellent. Even better, with a powerful twin-cylinder engine, plenty of storage, and belt drive, this is a great way to hit the open road.</p>
