<hr>
<p>Over six generations, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-is-no-ordinary-datsun-240z/">Nissan Z</a> has cemented itself as a sports car icon similar to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">Ford Mustang</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/low-mileage-1997-porsche-911-turbo/">Porsche 911</a>, so understandably, redesigning a legend is no easy task. As rumors swirl regarding a next-gen Z car, Alfonso Albaisa, senior vice president of design for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-teaches-robots/">Nissan</a>, talks about this car and what it means to him personally. The best part about this <em>Roadshow </em>article is that it wasn't your typical Q&A interview; it was written in the designer's own words himself!</p>
<p>According to Albaisa, the one thing that makes the Z stand out is its sports car proportions consisting of a long hood and short rear deck. While this long hood design was softened a bit with the introduction of the first-gen 300ZX, all six generations of the Z car have a look that is distinctive and instantly recognizable. To show this, Albaisa created a cool video during <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/is-covid-19/">COVID-19</a> showing him <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-wins-for-covid-19-kids-creativity/">sketch </a>a classic 240Z from home, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Since it was introduced in 1969, there have been six different versions of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-nissan-z-retro/">Nissan Z</a> starting with the 240Z/260Z/280Z (badged as a Datsun in Nissan's export markets including the U.S.) and continuing right up to the present with today's 370Z. There are rumors about a next-gen Z that could be called the 400Z, but so far, Nissan has not made any official announcements on this car.</p>
<p>So what is Albaisa's personal favorite Z? Interestingly, his favorite is the square-body 300ZX Z32 that was introduced in 1989 and was sold in the U.S. until 1996.
