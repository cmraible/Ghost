          "A century ago, Americans’ appetite for motorcycle performance was insatiable for the same reason why that’s the case in Thailand and other Asian countries today. When cars cost too much for the majority of the public to consider them for daily transportation, plus clogged roads favor those on two wheels, motorcycles reign supreme. As a result, Thai motorcycle racing is an unbelievable experience, as you’re about to see in the video accompanying this article. It’s also something few foreigners have ever beheld."

It features a bike show, a festival-like atmosphere, plus a red, white, and blue giant hand giving the hang ten sign. That, and they have tiny bikes drag racing at absolutely blistering speeds."

As you can see in the video, they’re also purpose-built with all kinds of additions. But weight is obviously a big factor, so they’re not bolting anything superfluous onto the frame."

Someone could reach out and touch a rider as he’s staging, not to mention if a rider were to wipe out it could end in disaster. In fact, you see some of these guys are riding on some pretty skinny tires and they’re definitely wobbly after launching."
