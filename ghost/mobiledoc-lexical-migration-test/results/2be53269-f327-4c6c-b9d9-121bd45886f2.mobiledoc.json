I’ve been using it to explore the intersection of digital technology, publishing and journalism for well over 18 years – and it’s where I continue to think out loud as part of my consultancy work.\n\n\n## About Me\n\nI’ve been a journalist for 25 years and a blogger for nearly two decades. Since 2006 I’ve been working-full time in digital journalism and publishing development, and I have extensive experience of change management, workflows, and technology implementation. \n\nI also deliver training of journalists, publishers and other content-centric people from students up to senior management level.\n\nSince 2012, I’ve been working independently as a consultant on:\n\n- <span style=\"line-height: 1.618;\">publishing strategy</span>\n- <span style=\"line-height: 1.618;\">digital journalism</span>\n- <span style=\"line-height: 1.618;\">mobile</span>\n- <span style=\"line-height: 1.618;\">social media.</span>\n\nMy clients have ranged from international magazine publishers, to national newspapers like the *Financial Times* and *The Telegraph*, to small businesses. I’m more interested in the challenge of the work than the size of the client.\n\nI’m also a visiting lecturer at City, University of London where I teach digital journalism and [audience engagement skills](https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/postgraduate/interactive-journalism) to Masters students, including video strategy, social media, community management, SEO and audience strategy.\n\nYou can see more about my </span>[career to date on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamtinworth). If you think I might be able to help you, please [drop me a line](mailto:adam@onemanandhisblog.com) and we can discuss working together.\n\n\n"
