<p>Friends:</p>
<p>President Biden is under pressure after <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> reporting exposed him betraying his promise to stop crushing student debtors.

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/biden-student-loan-bankruptcy/index.html">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/02/17/biden-student-loans-bankruptcy-dispute/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> both credited our reporting for breaking open this story of betrayal — and now Biden’s administration may be backtracking on some of its efforts to overturn student borrower victories. But it’s clear that the only way to make Biden fulfill his promise to student debtors is by continuing to subject him to the accountability journalism that you are funding with your subscription.</p>
