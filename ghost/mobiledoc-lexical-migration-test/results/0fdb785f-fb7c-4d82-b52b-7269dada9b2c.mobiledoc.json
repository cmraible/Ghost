The Ruf 911, for example, is blasting down the highway at a cool 300 kph (186 mph) and equally commendable is the fact that this tuned Porsche 911 shows 170,000 km (about 105,000 miles) on its odometer. Speaking of mileage, that Aston Martin shown getting sideways on the Italian back roads has just 16,000 kilometers – that's under 10,000 miles. Forget the entertainment value of this video, we want to learn more about these cars!"
