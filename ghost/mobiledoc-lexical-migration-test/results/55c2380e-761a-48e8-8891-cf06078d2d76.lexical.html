<hr>
<p>It’s always tragic to hear of a fellow enthusiast killed while <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/old-iihs-car-crash/">behind the wheel</a> of their beloved car, but that’s exactly what happened to 55-year-old Shaun Rees back on April 30. The Volkswagen enthusiast was on his way home after attending a car show when he was fatally injured <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-mustang-burns-crash/">in a crash</a> in Cornwall.</p>

<p>According to a report from Cornwall Live, the stretch of road where Rees was killed had been shut down by police as they conducted an investigation. Few details about the crash were provided to the media, even though the investigation had been completed. That means we still know precious little about what led up to Rees’ death.</p>
<p>What we do know is a man in his 70s who was driving a Ford was transported to the hospital with minor injuries after the crash. Sadly, some classic cars do very poorly in crashes with modern, heavy cars, particularly trucks and full-size SUVs. This is why we caution everyone to be particularly aware when driving to and from events in your hobby car. Still, vigilance alone might not always save you.</p>
<p>Rees’ family released a statement to the public, which was relayed by Cornwall Live: “The wife and family of Shaun Rees would like to say thank you for all the kind messages and calls received after the sudden loss of a very special person. Shaun was a loveable, caring, funny person, who lived and loved his life for his family, friends and his VWs.”<br>“Shaun was an active member of The Historic Volkswagen Club Committee, tragically taken from us on his way home from Stanford Hall VW Show proudly with his Concours Class award. You will always be in our hearts, our memories and our thoughts Shaun."</p>
