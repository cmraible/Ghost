<h2 id="defending-the-case-against-tiktok">Defending the case against TikTok </h2>
<p>One of the things I miss about the old days of blogging is the collegiate feel, the discussion between sites, and the sense of dialogue. And so, it was a <em>delight</em> to be invited back on <em>The Addition</em> podcast by Charlotte, to defend <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2023/01/four-things-publishers-should-give-up-in-2023/">my aberrant views on things like TikTok and Substack</a>.</p>
<p>It was a great conversation, and I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed recording it: </p>

<h2 id="how-social-networks-become-traps">How social networks become traps</h2>
<p>One thing I think people missed in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2023/01/four-things-publishers-should-give-up-in-2023/">the piece</a> that I was defending to Charlotte was that when I described TikTok as an attention roach motel, I wasn't just talking about how hard it is to get traffic out. (This is entirely my fault, looking at the way I phrased it. I'll rewrite that once this is done.) It's also about the way that these platforms evolve over time to become traps, even for those who are successful on them ‚Äî possibly <em>especially</em> those people.</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow has written a blistering screed about how this happens and just why it's such an issue: </p>
<blockquote>This is enshittification: surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they're locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once <em>they're</em> locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-ft-kills-its-mastodon-server">The FT kills its Mastodon server</h2>
<p>Did you know that the <em>Financial Times</em> had set up its own Mastodon instance? No, I didn't either. Well, its brief life is over, killed by management problems in more than one sense. Yes, the technical side of running it became an issue. But the senior management weren't delighted by this rogue experiment. </p>
<p>This paragraph made me laugh like a drain:</p>
<blockquote>Compliance, security and reputational risks are substantial and evergrowing in unpredictable ways. Though largely hypothetical, these risks were judged serious enough to exercise management at the highest levels. Those people have better things to do than to clean up our mess.</blockquote>
<p>Believe you me, as some one who spent the latter part of the 2000s launching and managing online communities for a publisher, <em>management never want to do it</em>. It involves ceding control to the readers in a way that they're just not comfortable with. </p>
