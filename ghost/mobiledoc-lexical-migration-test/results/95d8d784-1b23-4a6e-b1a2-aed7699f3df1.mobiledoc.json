After all, who wouldn’t want to sit in a comfortable den next to their Ferrari F40 while reading a book at night? It’s an idea we’ve seen spreading recently as garages are turned into lush living spaces and cars are pampered right alongside their owners."

And while these automobiles would look impressive in a barn that’s about to fall over, such a setting simply isn’t a proper storage facility for anything so precious."

What’s more, the handles to open cabinets and unfold bench seats in the living space inspired by those found on a Zagato. The lounge chairs’ shape was inspired by the Ferrari Dino, giving everything a unique but familiar feel."
