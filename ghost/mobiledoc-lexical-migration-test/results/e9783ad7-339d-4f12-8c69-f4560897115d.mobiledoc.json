That doesn’t make them unimpressive, but it does mean when one of those original roadsters is on display you’re in for a special treat. Even better is seeing a 1965 Shelby 427 Cobra Competition since only 23 were made. That’s what was on "

Few cars get anywhere near that kind of value, so even for Jay Leno it’s a bit pricey. He remarks about how driving it on the street might not be a great idea since, as you know, even if you’re being careful it only takes another driver not paying attention to cause an accident."

After all, there aren’t many assistance features onboard, and we’re not talking about the more modern things like ABS and traction control. If you want a pure driving experience, something like this will serve it up unapologetically."

Some people find it to be a welcome change of pace, because it’s just a gearhead talking about an interesting vehicle, not making small talk with someone else. What do you think? Should Jay Leno’s Garage keep doing this even after the shutdowns end?"
