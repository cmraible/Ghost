You enter battle with one of 14 weapons, each with their own unique playstyle and an option between melee and range. I personally opt to use the lance – that feeling of sitting there tanking the monster’s biggest hits to then come back at them with a counter feels so satisfying. Some of the weapons have really complex combos and tactics so it’s definitely worth checking out the training area to test out each weapon to find a weapon that suits your playstyle."

These take the form of tower defence style gameplay with turrets that can be manned by players or villagers for an automatic defender or special instalments that only have a very limited number of uses. This game mode works much better with four people, so if you don’t have three other friends, you can always play with random players by opening a join request when you take the rampage quest or by joining someone else's. This is a fun addition to the series especially with the challenging Apex fights, which are monsters that are stronger variations of certain monsters."

They allow you to dash into the air, climb up walls and hang in the air, however the manoeuvrability isn’t the only additional feature they’ve brought with them. Wirebugs allow hunters to use special silk attacks that use one or two wirebugs to perform - some are really powerful attacks and each weapon has two default silk attacks. By completing quests or by forging eight of a particular weapon, you can unlock additional attacks that are swappable for standard attacks or a new silk attack. But these wirebugs aren’t done yet. Have you ever wanted to re-enact Godzilla vs King Kong? Well, with the wirebugs, you have the ability to mount the monsters and take control of them for a limited amount of time, allowing you to fight other monsters or just ram them into walls for additional damage. The wirebug adds a plethora of features that are really fun to explore and very satisfying to pull off."
