The log books and history of this SCCA car driven by Jim Crittendon are included."

This Toyota was built for the SVRA Vintage competition and boasts some wins in its history. A Don Preston Toyota Atlantic engine produces 215-horsepower at a lofty 9500 rpm, so this is no performance pushover. Plus, there are many extras added to this vehicle, including a cool suit and 10-quart dry sump oil system."

The seller says it has quite the history of podium finishes and comes with the HSR and SVRA logbooks. Of course, the Chevy 465ci big block V8 mated to a T101A racing transmission combined with no windshield make for exhilarating fun."
