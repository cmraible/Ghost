Some cops might get angry about this guy going over 100 mph on fairly narrow, winding surface streets. Instead, the pursuing troopers is calm and methodical, keeping up with the suspect while being safe about it."

We don’t know if the other trooper had just done a traffic stop, was trying to pull over this Challenger, or something else. What we do know is the vehicle we get the footage from follows the Dodge for a couple of blocks or so before turning on its lights. Instead of running immediately, the suspect tries driving around like nothing happened."

Not shaking the trooper, the suspect decides to take a little dirt road, then stops fully at a stop sign, allowing the trooper to spin him out and end the chase.
