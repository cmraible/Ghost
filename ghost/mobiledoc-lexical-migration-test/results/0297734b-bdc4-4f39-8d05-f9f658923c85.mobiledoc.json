          "Whereas many small trucks of the era were still designed for the job site, the Comanche, like the Cherokee, was aimed more toward enthusiasts with available four-wheel drive and a larger, more mid-size feel. The slightly larger size proved to be one of the strong points, while the underpowered engine options (AMC four-cylinder, GM V6 and Renault diesel) were major downfalls. Any Comanche buyer knows that the 4.0-liter inline-six is THE engine to get, and it was introduced for the 1987 model year."

Today, Comanches have gotten more collectible in recent years, and it's interesting to see these first-year Comanches in brand-new condition. The video even shows new Comanches (and Cherokees) rolling of Jeep's assembly line in Toledo, Ohio."
