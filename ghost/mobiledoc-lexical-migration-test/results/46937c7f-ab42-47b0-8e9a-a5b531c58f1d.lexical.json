In total, the Nissan only weighs 2,800lbs which is sort of a massive difference and is probably the main reason why it won both the first and second race. However, in the end the Nissan was only able to beat the Camaro by using an engine platform designed for the Camaro so we all know who the real winner is here… yeah, it's still the Nissan.",
