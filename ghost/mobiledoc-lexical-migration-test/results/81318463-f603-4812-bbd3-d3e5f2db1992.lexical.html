<p>There will be many impressive cars crossing the auction block at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/barrett-jackson-50" rel="nofollow">Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction</a> in January, but this <a href="https://www.barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/2000-MERCEDES-BENZ-E320-CUSTOM-PICKUP-236333" rel="nofollow">2000 Mercedes-Benz E320 pickup</a> is definitely a standout. After all, it subverts your expectations in so many ways, taking a European wagon and turning it into a pickup truck like one you’ve never seen.</p>

<p>According to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/paul-walker-collection" rel="nofollow">Barrett-Jackson</a>, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mercedes-Benz" rel="nofollow">Mercedes-Benz</a> was ordered new by a dealer in the Atlanta area. Before it was delivered, the dealer had it professionally converted into a pickup truck. From the state of that silky black exterior and the exterior brightwork, this vehicle doesn’t appear to have lived a hard life in the least. It also has a mere 21,000 miles on the odometer, likely because the previous owner realized just what a special machine it is.</p>

<p>Under the hood of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Mercedes-Benz/E320" rel="nofollow">Mercedes-Benz E320</a> is the factory 3.2-liter V6 engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. To accommodate the bed, the chassis had to be elongated by 29 inches. In the bed has a spray-in liner and diamond plate liner, while brushed stainless steel bed rails add a high-end feel while still looking utilitarian. LED lights in the bed rails are a nice addition, and unexpected in something of this vintage. That rear window has hinges, so you can open it.</p>

<p>While the payload in the rear is certainly something to marvel at, the impeccably-clean interior is worthy gawking at as well. First off, the rear seats are two buckets with a center console made by Mercedes-Benz, preserving the stock feel of this strange <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a>.</p>
<p>Tan MB-Tex upholstery with tan carpeting, wood-grain accents, and black rubber floormats all look about as good was when this wagon was new. From the pictures, all the factory equipment seems to be in place and functional, including the infotainment system, Parktronic, and Bluetooth, which is phenomenal.</p>

<p>This is a truly one-of-a-kind vehicle which will certainly turn plenty of heads. It’s also about the only way to have a German pickup in the United States. Bidding for this lot could be fierce when it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/dream-cars-to-be-auctioned-at-barrett-jackson-for-great-causes" rel="nofollow">crosses the block</a>, and we’ll certainly be keeping our eyes on the process to see how it turns out.</p>
