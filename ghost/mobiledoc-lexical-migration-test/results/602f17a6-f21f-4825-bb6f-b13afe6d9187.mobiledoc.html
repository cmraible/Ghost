<p>An historically-significant name for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">Mustang faithfu</a>l, Ford knew it couldn’t slap the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-ford-mustang-boss-302-restomod/">Boss 302 moniker</a> onto just any <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> and expect people to line up to purchase it. What’s more, the 2013 model borrowed some styling cues from the storied <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/boss-302-after-25-years/">1970 Mustang Boss 302</a>, such as the hockey stick stripes. But this isn’t a car you buy just for the aesthetics, because there’s so much more to it.</p>

<p>However, the aesthetics on this Ford are quite enthralling. Gotta Have It Green pairs with black graphics and trim, including black 10-spoke factory wheels, making a strong statement. This car comes with a rear spoiler, subtle front splitter, rear diffuser, and a front tow hook for a hint at its track-going aspirations. Add to that sequential taillights and rear window louvres for a little bit of nostalgic fun.</p>

<p>If you were to know nothing about the S-197 Boss 302s and you peeked at the interior, you might further suspect this car is aping a track vehicle. After all, there are racing-inspired Recaro seats with tall bolstering on the back and seat cushions. However, there are also plenty of comfort you wouldn’t expect for a real track toy, including air conditioning, an infotainment center, keyless ignition, carpeting, etc.</p>

<p>What really counts is what’s under the hood, a hard-hitting 5.0-liter V8 Ford claims makes 444-horsepower and gets this car moving from 0-60 in 4.2 seconds. Of course, you get that true three-pedal driving experience, which is a blast on any track, thanks to the 6-speed manual transmission.</p>
