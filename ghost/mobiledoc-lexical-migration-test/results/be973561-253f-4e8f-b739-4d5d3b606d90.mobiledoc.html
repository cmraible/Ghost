<p><a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/2017-maserati-granturismo-white">The name Gran Turismo</a> will live on forever in the hearts and minds of European automotive enthusiasts. Whether it is because of the cars which dominated racing in the 1950s and '60s or the video game that got many of us into vehicles, the GT name holds a lot of weight in car culture. Sports car and supercar manufacturers understand this all too well and, as such, have produced many incredible vehicles which wear that moniker. <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/2017-maserati-granturismo-white">Maserati</a> is a remarkably well-known brand in the luxury performance market and has been the creator of some of racing's best cars. Here is one example of that incredible and vast lineup.</p>

<p>As you can tell from the modern styling cues present on the vehicle, this <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/2017-maserati-granturismo-white">Maserati GranTurismo</a> is a 2017 model. This is relatively new for a performance car like itself and may even be the perfect opportunity to get behind the wheel of an excellent sports car without paying the price of a brand new example. With only 38,000 miles on the odometer, it's clear that, while it has undoubtedly experienced a healthy amount of driving, it won't break the bank with repair costs or maintenance. Most supercar owners may not need to be concerned with prices like that but what they are most certainly focused on is performance.</p>
