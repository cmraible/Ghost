<hr>
<p>When you want to own a classic car that can win all kinds of awards at the best shows, you can’t settle with just anything. And while any 1963 Chevrolet Corvette with that eye-grabbing, rare split window is always going to generate excitement, few if any can hold a candle to this particular one. This is a genuine numbers-matching example which has achieved the coveted Triple Crown Registry Triple Crown Award as well as NCRS Top Flight honors. That alone should be enough to impress anyone, but there’s plenty more to this car.</p>

<p>Take this investment-grade, concours-condition C2 Stingray to any show and you’ll have the crowds gawking in no time. Even more importantly, the ultra-critical judges will be impressed by the immaculate condition of the Daytona Blue exterior and Dark Blue interior, with correct details buttoned up to perfection. Even the 15-inch turbine-style wheels are free of blemishes and absolutely dazzle the eye.</p>
<p>Not only is the 327ci L76 V8 under the hood in highly presentable condition, it’s the original engine. The same is true of the Borg Warner T10 four-speed manual transmission. Also included on this car is a Posi-traction differential with 3.70 gears, all correct for this C2.</p>
<p>The list of awards this ’63 ‘Vette has captured is long and impressive. Other than those mentioned above, this Chevrolet has been also been awarded Bloomington Gold and Chevy/Vettefest Gold Spinner honors, both highly sought-after accolades which further add to the already outstanding credentials of this classic American sports car.</p>
<p>Whomever is lucky enough to buy this 1963 Chevrolet Corvette from RK Motors will receive the NCRS Shipping Data Report and the various award certificates to display with pride. You don’t come across many split-window C2 Corvettes, let alone one in such beautiful condition with a string of impressive awards under its belt. This would easily be the crown jewel of most collections.</p>
