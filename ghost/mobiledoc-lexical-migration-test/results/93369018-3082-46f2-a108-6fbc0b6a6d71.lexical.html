<p>In a tweet just now, Twitter has officially announced that it has filed an S-1 with the SEC, meaning the social networking service will be going public.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p>We’ve confidentially submitted an S-1 to the SEC for a planned IPO. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.</p>
    <p>— Twitter (@twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/378261932148416512">September 12, 2013</a></p>

<p>While we don’t know much yet about how much the company looks to raise in its IPO as the S-1 hasn’t been made public at this time, we expect Twitter to go public at a valuation of between $15 and $20 billion.  This assumption is based on the fact its last round of private money came in at around a $10 billion valuation, and those investors will obviously want a return on their investment.</p>
<p>We’ll keep you updated as we learn more. By the way, Facebook’s IPO valued the social networking giant at $100 billion.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
