Remember my liveblogging from <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&tag=zeitgeist%20project&limit=20">the Zeitgeist Project in Berlin</a>? They were the people behind it.</p>
<p>His new blog <a href="http://www.freestate.co.uk/blog/">Adam’s Apples</a> is a buffet of interesting ideas about narrative expressed in a physical context. Must-read.</p>

<p><a href="http://notsothinlizzy.com">Not So Thin Lizzie</a> is a journey through her interest in food. Pop over, salivate a little and give her some encouragement.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
