<hr>
<p>The Mercedes <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-monaco/">Formula One</a> team principal and co-owner Toto Wolff has confirmed that he will be selling off this entire <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ferrari-f40-bandit-edition/">collection of Ferraris</a>, which is an impressive lineup. It’s an interesting move that we suspect is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lewis-hamilton-car-collection-sit/">at least in part political</a>, because the man who’s working so closely with Mercedes can’t be seen driving a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mclaren-f1-car/">rival’s vehicle</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>Test your knowledge of the Ferrari F40 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>One of the top cars Wolff has put on the market is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2003-ferrari-enzo-auction/">2003 Ferrari Enzo</a> with a mere 1,478 miles on the clock. Obviously, the man didn’t take this for a cruise every weekend or even once a month, making us suspect he bought it almost strictly as an investment back in 2014.</p>

<p>Another notable Ferrari he’s selling off is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/gordon-ramsays-car-collection/">2018 LaFerrari Aperta</a>. Considering that supercar only has delivery mileage on the clock, there’s no doubt he purchased it strictly with the idea of sitting on it, letting the value appreciate, then liquifying it for big bucks, which he no doubt will get.</p>

<p>Wolff isn’t just looking to liquidate his Ferraris. The man is also selling off this Mercedes SL65 AMG Black Series, which he actually helped develop using the Nurburgring Nordschleife 13 years ago. That, apparently, proves this isn’t about F1 politics or making a statement of any sort, but instead is just Wolff clearing out what he doesn’t want, or something of that nature. Honestly, it’s a little perplexing he’s ditching an amazing supercar he had a hand in developing, but apparently he gets more joy out of the other rides in his garage. It’s worth noting the SL65 AMG Black Series only has 3,204 miles on the clock, which is more than any other ride he’s selling, so at least there’s that.</p>
<p>The explanation Wolff gave for selling all these Ferraris and his SL65 AMG Black Series is that he simply doesn’t have enough time to drive them all. There might be something to that, but we think the fact some of these exotics are worth ridiculous sums at the moment is also fueling the move.</p>
