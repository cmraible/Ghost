The British brand has worked closely with the Ferrari Scuderia engineering and design teams to ensure complete accuracy to the most minute details. A mere 500 will be produced and the price has been set at $795. That might seem steep to some, but hardcore collectors will consider that a deal and won’t hesitate to pony up the cash."
