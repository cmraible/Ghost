The engine features headers and a custom exhaust system to provide a deep rumble, and in true muscle car fashion, this small-block V8 is matched with a four-speed manual gearbox. Inside, this transmission is topped with a cue ball shifter, and the cabin shows as well as the rest of the car with flawless upholstery and trim, and about the only thing that isn't original inside this Camaro is the aftermarket stereo system. Thanks to features like power steering, power brakes and factory air conditioning, this restored 1973 Chevrolet Camaro is ready to cruise."
