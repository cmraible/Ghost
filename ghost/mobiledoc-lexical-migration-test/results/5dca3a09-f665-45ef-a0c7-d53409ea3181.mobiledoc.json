The same goes for the prominent brightwork on the bumpers, grille, and other trim pieces, as well as the hubcaps and whitewall tires. Pull up anywhere in this ride and you will gather a big crowd, because this has the classic look everyone appreciates and recognizes as something special."

Add to that the fact this particular car made appearances in “The Ultimate Life” and “The Longest Ride” and you have something quite compelling."
