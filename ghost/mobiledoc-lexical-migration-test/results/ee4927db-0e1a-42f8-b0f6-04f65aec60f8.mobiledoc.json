It belonged to the man until New Zealand authorities seized it during a police raid of his mansion in Coatesville back in 2012. Now the classic American luxury car is being auctioned off, so you could have a chance at owning it."

From the photos everything looks to be in reasonably good condition, including the paint, chrome, and white interior. The seller did say the horn ring has broken and that the white wall tires have yellowed some. However, there’s some nice factory equipment included, like air conditioning."

The seller also claims there are no “signs of major repairs to the body” and that a “panel beater” who focuses on classic cars inspected the Caddie, concluding it’s “in great condition.” This person also claims some “experienced Cadillac collectors” looked at it and said it’s worth “at least $180,000” in its present condition. Keep in mind that’s for the Kiwi market with New Zealand dollars."

Supposedly, Dotcom didn’t go through the correct process of importing the luxury convertible into the country, so that was a bit of a problem. If true, and we can’t verify it is, that’s quite the story that really generates some interesting questions."
