          "Unless you’ve been living in a cave or under a rock, you know for about a year automakers have been suffering from a shortage of microprocessor chips which are necessary for a number of features. This has meant auto giants shuttering factories for weeks on end, trimming back on production, and even storing unfinished cars in hopes they can install the chips at a later date. With predictions of this situation being alleviated in a matter or months or even a couple of years, it might be shocking to hear Toyota has already found a solution."

Toyota has announced it will be back to full global production capacity in December. In fact, the company says it anticipates churning out 800,000 vehicles next month, up from the 760,000 it made in December of 2020."

After all, it’s been proven consumers in North America and other markets have quite the appetite for new cars. If Toyota dealerships are the only ones with any vehicle stock to speak of, it doesn’t take a genius to realize the automaker will clean up. That might even mean some shoppers switch their brand loyalty to Toyota for years to come, meaning this change might cause some long-term market shifts."

That can-do attitude is refreshing at a time when everyone seems apt to blame any shortcoming on the pandemic."

          "Meanwhile, the chip shortage has led to a tremendous car shortage for dealerships. You can probably drive around your local dealerships and see large swaths of the lots empty, as have we. It’s the same thing north of the border in Ontario, Canada. A report out of Windsor, which is right over the river from Detroit, has detailed out how many dealers are selling cars before they even arrive, so they’re keeping next to nothing onsite. That report went over GM, Volkswagen, Nissan, Kia, and other dealerships. This is why Toyota’s move to full production will attract shoppers who don’t want to wait weeks or months for a vehicle to be made and delivered. One dealer even admitted demand is so high if they had vehicles in stock they would be selling twice as many. It’s a good time to own a Toyota dealership, or it will be soon enough."
