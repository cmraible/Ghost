<hr>
<p>National and local car events have been canceled left and right thanks to a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/is-covid-19/">pandemic</a> that reared its ugly head at the beginning of 2020. That didn't stop many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/classic-car-market/">classic car owners</a> from getting together and forming a parade to welcome home one of their own on a Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>One of the organizers of a local Memorial Day <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-911-reimagined-by-singer-for-sale/">car show</a> that was canceled was recently released from Baylor Scott & White Hillcrest Medical Center in Waco, Texas. Steve Nors, 61, spent a long four months to the day in the hospital where he was battling pneumonia and a blood infection after receiving open heart surgery.</p>
<p>To his surprise, over 50 cars had formed a parade to welcome Nors back home. Three local car clubs joined forces including the Heart of Texas Old Car Club, Brazos Valley <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/muscle-car-birthday/">Muscle Cars</a>, and the West Cruisers, to surround Steve's home in Elm Mott.</p>
<p><em>"I couldn't believe it," </em>said Nors.<em> "There were so many cars."</em></p>
<p>The parade consisted of classic cars along with tractors, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-general-lee-police-chase/">police units</a>, and even street sweepers. </p>
<p><em>"They even brought out the TYMCO sweepers," </em>said Nors.<em> "I just can't believe what happened,"</em></p>
<p>Nors was a former technician for TYMCO Inc. After a lengthy stay away from home and calling a hospital room home for four months, the heart-felt gesture and unexpected surprise brought Nors to tears.</p>
<p>His leg had deteriorated from being in the hospital for so long, but he did start out-patient therapy the week after coming home. The one thing Nors looks forward to most is getting back behind the wheel of his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1966-pontiac-gto/">Pontiac GTO</a>, and to start planning next year's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/digital-concours/">car show</a>. </p>
<p>Despite the pandemic and everything happening around the world, there is still some good left out there. Car enthusiasts tend to be a tight-knit group of people, and we are happy to hear that Nors has that kind of support from his fellow friends and car lovers.
