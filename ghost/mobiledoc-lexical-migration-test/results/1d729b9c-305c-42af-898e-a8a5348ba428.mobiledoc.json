This single-cylinder 3-Wheeler was manufactured by High Mileage Vehicles and claimed 10 - 100mpg. The microcar’s engine is placed directly behind the driver with a CVT transmission providing drive to the single rear wheel. There’s no reverse gear, so turning around in a tight space requires a small amount of manual labor."

The 1980 model is either powered by a 12hp or 16hp engine — apparently there are no identifying marks — and could do with a mechanical tune-up. However, one of the biggest draws of this Freeway is its low mileage, clocking just 6133 miles from new."
