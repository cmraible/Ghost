<p>Thanks to the sustained popularity of digital communications and payment methods, you probably don’t send many things through the mail these days. Maybe that’s why the United States Postal Service decided to honor five classic pony cars, giving you and plenty of other people a reason to go splurge at your local post office.</p>

<p>Commemorated with these Forever stamps is the 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 302, 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28, 1969 AMC Javelin SST, 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T, and 1967 Mercury Cougar XR-7 GT. As noted in the press release about the issuance of these new stamps, each model embodies the “youthful spirit” of the automotive world from that time period. That symbolism carries on today, with some current models resurrecting certain styling cues from their predecessors.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s as the horsepower wars ramped up, American automakers realized they could appeal to Baby Boomers by offering small, flashy, affordable, and at least fairly powerful pony cars. These vehicles from Ford, GM, Chrysler, and AMC were a fun alternative to what parents were driving, allowing the upcoming generation to set itself apart in a meaningful way. We don’t have anything which is truly the equivalent of these classics today, a fact we lament often.</p>
<p>USPS also calls the pony cars “a uniquely American obsession.” We know some enthusiasts in Australia who’d like a word with them, because that’s not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>Release of these new pony car postage stamps will take place at the Great American Stamp Show in Sacramento, California, which will be both free and open to the public. The date of the ceremony is Thursday, August 25 at 11 am. If you want to attend, USPS is encouraging you to RSVP <a href="https://uspsonlinesolutions.wufoo.com/forms/m46h5ox1w6a5an/">here</a>.</p>
