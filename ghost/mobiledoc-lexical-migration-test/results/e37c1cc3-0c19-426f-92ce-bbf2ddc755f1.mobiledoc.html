<h3 id="nascar-team-owner-and-longtime-friend-richard-childress-just-sold-one-of-his-most-prized-possessions-to-help-coronavirus-relief-efforts-">NASCAR team owner and longtime friend Richard Childress just sold one of his most prized possessions to help coronavirus relief efforts.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Just recently, we brought you a few items that went to auction to help the charity called Feeding America. One of those items was this <a href="https://www.barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/1996-CHEVROLET-MONTE-CARLO-3-DALE-EARNHARDT-NASCAR-RACE-CAR-242306">No. 3 1996 Chevrolet Monte Carlo</a> piloted by none other than the late Dale Earnhardt. The car crossed the online auction at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barrett-jackson-takes-over-sunshine-state-with-desirable-drop-tops/">Barrett-Jackson</a>, and the hammer came down at $425,000. Is that hefty price tag worth having the Intimdator's '96 Monte Carlo? </p>
<p>Richard Childress, NASCAR team owner, has more than a few items worth of racing memorabilia and racing items from the past 50 years to auction off to help with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/exotic-collection-coronavirus/">coronavirus</a> relief efforts. Among the items up for bids is a prized possession from Childress's own personal collection - an original Dale Earnhardt No. 3 race car. Earnhardt drove under the <a href="https://www.rcrracing.com/">Richard Childress Racing</a> name and was a longtime friend.</p>

<p>The exact car that is up for grabs has not been specified by team officials, but we do know that it has been "impeccably preserved" by Earnhardt's old friend and team owner. The No. 3 car will come complete with the engine intact. This will also be the first time Childress has parted with one of Earnhardt's original cars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/RichardChildresscollection">eBay auction</a> started on Thursday without an end date, and the large amount of racing and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nascar-indycar-driver-john-andretti-dies-after-battling-cancer/">NASCAR</a> items include action figures, die-cast <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-swiping-rc-cars/">cars</a>, and seat cushions. Over 100 items are in the auction with all proceeds benefiting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-covid-19-is-affecting-collector-car-auctions/">COVID-19</a> relief efforts with one being Feeding America. Those interested in buying the No. 3 Dale Earnhardt race car will have to contact Richard Childress Racing directly. </p>

<p>Earnhardt started racing with RCR team back in 1984 full time, where he nabbed 67 wins along with 6 out of his 7 Cup series championships. Earnhardt hailed from Kannapolis, North Carolina, and RCR is based in Welcome, NC.</p>
<p>Tragically, Dale Earnhardt lost his life on February 18, 2001, after a terrifying crash during the last lap of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway. You can find all of the coronavirus relief <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/RichardChildresscollection">auction items here</a>.</p>
