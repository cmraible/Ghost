Underneath years and years of ads was a hand-painted advertisement for the “new” Dodge Caravan from all the way back in 1996. For many, the blast from the past was a reminder of how much things have changed in the past couple of decades."

Considering Dodge hasn’t made a minivan in a few years, maybe it’s for the best. In the past 26 years, the attitude that was going on with the Viper has permeated the brand, although what the future holds for Dodge at this point seems uncertain at best."
