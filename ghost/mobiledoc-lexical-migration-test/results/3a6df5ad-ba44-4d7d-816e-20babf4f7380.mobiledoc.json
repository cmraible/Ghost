It features a rarely used 440-cid V8 engine rated at 375-horsepower, a TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission, a 3.91:1 rear gear ratio, and not much else. Thanks, in large part, to the lack of options such as power steering and power brakes, the ‘Cuda weighs in at 3,604 -lbs including driver. In case you are missing the theme here, Plymouth was clearly shooting for light and powerful."

According to Car Life testing a 1970 Pontiac GTO with a 455 and a 3.55 gears was capable of a  1/4 mile ET of 14.8 seconds @ 95.94 mph but Muscle Car Review said theirs ran 13.5 seconds @ 103.5 mph. Car Life’s 1969 Plymouth Barracuda Cuda 440 ran the 1/4 mile in 13.89 seconds @ 103.2 mph. So, this drag race seems to be a pretty fair fight, though judging by specs alone, it is pretty clear how it is gonna go. Not to spoil the ending but Mopar made one heck of a muscle car back in 1969."
