It would appear that the days of big V8 engines and muscle car styling from the factory were in hibernation at that point. However, one brand managed to keep its prized pony car looking good despite the growing issues. That was Pontiac, and the vehicle they chose to stay alive was the Firebird, Trans Am, and Formula models. While other GM legends like the Nova slowly turned into grandma-cruisers and luxury boats, the Firebird stayed true to what it was meant to be, eventually morphing into one of the most iconic cars of all time.

This is no ordinary Firebird; this is a Pontiac Trans Am that features that elusive 455 cubic inch V8. Any true Pontiac enthusiast will know why this is an incredibly desirable engine, as it was one of the largest V8s at the time.
