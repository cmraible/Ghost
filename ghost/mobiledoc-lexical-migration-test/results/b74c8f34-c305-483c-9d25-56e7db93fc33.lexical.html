<p>Kaiser Jeep first produced the Jeepster Commando in 1966 as a direct competitor to the Ford Bronco, International Scout, and the Toyota Land Cruiser. At the time, the Commando was available as a pickup truck, wagon, roadster, and a convertible.</p>
<p>Kaiser continued to build the Commando until it was purchased by American Motor Corporation (AMC) in 1970. Some two years later, AMC shortened the Jeepster's name to Commando C104, extended the wheelbase to 104 inches, and changed the front-end design to accommodate AMC's inline-six and the 304 cubic-inch, 5.0-liter V8 engines.</p>
<p>The Jeepster Commando was formerly an AMC best seller, but the new configuration did not sit well with Commando enthusiasts and began to drop in popularity. As a result, the Commando was taken out of production in 1973 and was replaced by the Cherokee.</p>
