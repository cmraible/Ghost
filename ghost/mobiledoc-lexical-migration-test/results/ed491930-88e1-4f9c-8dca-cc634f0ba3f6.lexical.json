Then we started doing some digging and it quickly became apparent this isn’t just some freak, isolated incident. Scotland has had a car firebombing problem for some time, and we’ve even run across similar incidents in other parts of the UK.",

Like the others, the attack was done in the middle of the night. If you’re noticing a pattern of German luxury cars (we found one incident of a Volvo being torched and another involving a work van) targeted when most people are asleep in bed, well that’s pretty obvious. But we found one incident of a Volvo being torched and another involving a work van. We even uncovered video of teens torching a police car with officers inside, so this seems to be a thing in the UK. The real question is why? Are these just mischievous youth as some claim? Is this some sort of class warfare? Many of the people targeted in the car firebombings are business owners and live in nice neighborhoods. Is this environmental activists deciding to take out internal-combustion engines by burning heaps of plastic? Or are these just plain old pyromaniacs who really love fire?",
