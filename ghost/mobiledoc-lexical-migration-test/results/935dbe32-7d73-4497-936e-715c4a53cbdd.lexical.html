<p>Despite the flurry of jargon and buzzwords, this is exciting stuff. I'll explain why in just a moment:</p>
<blockquote>The Collab Challenges are a new series of collaborative experiments that bring together media organisations to explore innovative solutions that improve journalism via the use of AI technologies. The Challenges will see teams of about 5 media organisations work together for around 6 months in collaboration with academic labs and R&D partners. Together, they will co-design prototypes of new products and methods, and produce innovative coverage of news stories or issues, with the support of AI.</blockquote>
<p>Now, you might quite well be wondering ‚ÄúAdam, what the hell does this have to do with me?‚Äù. </p>
<p>Here's why it matters: </p>
<p>Up until now technology has been largely something that happens <em>to</em> us, and we adapt. This LSE initiative is starting to get the industry proactively thinking about how AI tools can benefit our work. We were behind the curve on the web, on mobile, on social media‚Ä¶ Perhaps this time we'll be ahead of it. </p>
