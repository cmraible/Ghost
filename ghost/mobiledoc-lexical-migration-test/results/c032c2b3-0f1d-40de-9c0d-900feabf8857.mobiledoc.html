<hr>
<p>The Dodge Power Wagon was the civilian version of the military-spec Dodge WC so these trucks were already capable of making easy work of any terrain, but if a standard Power Wagon isn't enough for the most discerning of collectors, Legacy Classic Trucks has the answer. With a custom body and restomod powertain, this 1949 Dodge Power Wagon Crew Cab will go anywhere and look great in the process!</p>

<p>Building on the Power Wagon's rugged good looks, this custom truck's design adds a custom four-door body and wood-lined short-bed cargo box, but the tapered hood and flat fenders were left untouched. Wrapping those bead-lock wheels, this truck rides on monster 40-inch tires, so retractable side steps make it easier to get in and out of this beast. Like any real restomod, this Power Wagon has a bespoke interior that is modernly stylish and luxurious with tan leather seats and carpeted floors to accent the wood steering wheel and vintage-style gauges.</p>
<p>At the heart of this build is a twin-turbo Cummins 4BT four-cylinder laying down 350 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque, and it sends power to those massive tires through a pair of Dana 60 axles with locking differentials and locking hubs. Legacy Classic Trucks says that this 1949 Dodge Power Wagon drives just as good on the road as it does on the trail, and just in case it runs into any problems off-road, there's a winch built into the front bumper.</p>
<p>This candy apple red crew cab represents the 108th Power Wagon restomod that Legacy Classic Trucks has built, and each truck takes well over 2,000 man-hours of build time to complete. As such, these trucks definitely aren't cheap with a <em>starting</em> price of $350,000, and that doesn't even include upgraded options!</p>
