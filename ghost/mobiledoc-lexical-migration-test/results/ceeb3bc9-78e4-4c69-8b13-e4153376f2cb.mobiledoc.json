I think a lot of them aren’t from Southern Utah or anywhere near there, so once they’re outside of urban centers or suburban sprawl they’re pretty much clueless. Matt’s commented a lot of them see some Instagram post about a majestic spot in the area, they look up the “roads” leading to it, and they’re off in a rental Dodge Challenger to take on a trail that’s suitable for Jeeps. And by Jeeps I mean Wranglers or XJ Cherokees, not the grocery getters."
