I'll be focusing primarily on the final challenge of the Elite 4 and Cynthia in this review as this is where it is most noticeable. Their teams are specialised with certain strategies in mind, making use of held items and competitive mechanics like IVs and EVs, which results in a critical hit build Drapion that can almost 100% guarantee a critical hit, or making use of stat buffs and Baton Pass. Genuinely, it's great to have a challenge again in Pokémon, featuring battles that don't feel like they're simply handed to you on a silver platter. And then there's Cynthia; her whole team is exceptionally powerful and it capitalises on certain abilities and held items for each Pokémon, like the absolute tank of Marvel Scale/Flame Orb Milotic or her terrifyingly powerful Garchomp that uses Swords Dance and then proceeds to slaughter your party. However, you can cheese out the fight with enough revives to wear her Pokémon out of PP."

Also, walking with your Pokémon can now happen freely after you take any of them into Amity Park which results in some really cute and clever animations. Some of my favourite examples are of Spiritomb not being able to keep up, Rotom zipping around as a ball of energy and occasionally blipping into it's form or Golem rolling around like a giant marble."

In saying that though, this is a great way for newer players to experience the fourth generation without having to resort to expensive or illegal methods. Overall, these remakes are solid experiences for players to enjoy with options of self imposed challenge runs for more seasoned Pokémon enthusiasts, which becomes more accessible for me thanks to the Sinnoh Grand Underground as I go and start my mono-fire type run."
