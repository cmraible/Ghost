One of the most difficult engineering feats Lamborghini insisted on was that the heavy SUV could hit at least 100 mph on the road and accelerate with ferocity. Not only did the V12 allow for that, it provided enough low-end torque to allow the SUV to climb a 120% gradient. It was an exotic Italian truck which could roll over rocks and ford rivers."

It’s a pretty wild story about cops, bad weather, other teams in the rally sabotaging them, and more, so it’s definitely worth watching the video. The most amazing part of Harrison’s story is how he emphasized the Lambo SUV had zero mechanical problems the entire multi-day trip. That alone is amazing, because the Italian automaker didn’t exactly have a stellar reputation for reliability back in the 80s."

Bringing the vehicle to the US was a gamble since it hadn’t been developed for this market, so there was some effort to make it appealing to well-heeled consumers who probably weren’t going to hit the Rubicon or Metal Masher, even though the Lambo could handle that kind of abuse."
