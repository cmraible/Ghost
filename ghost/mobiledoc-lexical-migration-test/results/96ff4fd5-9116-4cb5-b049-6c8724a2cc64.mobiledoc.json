Riders and drivers alike need to have skills to de-escalate misunderstandings before they turn into full-on confrontations or how to simmer down someone who’s trying to engage in an all-out fight."

Instead of just stating who’s right and wrong in the confrontations, I’ll be looking at what the bikers and pedestrians/drivers did to escalate and de-escalate as well as what they could’ve done differently.
