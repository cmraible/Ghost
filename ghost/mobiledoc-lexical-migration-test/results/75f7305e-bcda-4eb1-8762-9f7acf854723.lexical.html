<p>Conservative Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is holding up his party’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure package, in part because he doesn’t like provisions in it that might reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels. While his position might seem to play well in the coal fields of his home state, the Senator’s moves also directly benefit his multimillion-dollar coal empire — operations that have long avoided public scrutiny. But, as we note in this week’s Weekend Reader, a new bombshell report by <em>Type Investigations</em> and <em>The Intercept </em>has pulled back the curtain on those businesses — revealing decades of safety violations, extensive pollution, and multiple deaths.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2021/09/03/joe-manchins-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/"><strong>Joe Manchin’s Dirty Empire</strong></a> (Type Investigations) — <em>“For the first time, a </em>Type Investigations <em>and </em>Intercept <em>analysis of public records reveals the impact of Manchin’s coal firms. For decades, they have relied on mines and refuse piles cited for dozens of Mine Safety and Health Agency violations, multiple deaths, and wastewater discharging that has poisoned tributaries feeding into the Monongahela River, as hundreds of thousands of tons of carcinogenic coal ash are dumped across Marion County. While Manchin does not own the mines, refuse piles, and power plants that have polluted Marion County, he continues to reap their financial rewards. In tracing the life cycle of Manchin’s coal, from its origin at refuse sites, to the looming plants it powers, down into the water and soil of northern West Virginia, the steep and complex cost of Manchin’s empire begins to take shape.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/09/02/twelve-hours-in-a-florida-covid-19-icu/"><strong>Twelve hours in a Florida COVID-19 ICU</strong></a> (Tampa Bay Times) — <em>“Across the country — around the world — the same scenes are playing out. Emergency rooms are overwhelmed. Ambulances are being turned away. More people are dying each day: An average of 250, just in Florida. The delta variant is spreading faster, striking harder, hitting younger people, even kids. The saddest part, Jen says, is this didn’t have to happen. Most of her patients, and the ones suffering the most, haven’t been vaccinated.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/10/prehistoric-america-atlantis/619819/"><strong>The Search For America’s Atlantis</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“Braje scraped away part of the cliff’s face, revealing bands of ancient soil, cleanly differentiated by color. He ran a finger along the darkest one, a coffee-colored signature of a distinct geological moment roughly 12,000 years ago, when a global flash freeze briefly returned the Earth to Ice Age conditions. In the older soils beneath was a small depression, unremarkable in appearance, but epochal in its significance for Paleoindian archaeology. It was from this cavity that archaeologists pulled the oldest human bone ever excavated in California, and perhaps the oldest in the entire Western Hemisphere. The 13,100-year-old human femur fragment belonged to “Arlington Man,” whose presence here may help resolve one of the final mysteries of the human origin story: the identity of the first Americans.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nj.com/inside-jersey/2012/08/the_redemption_of_michael_k_williams.html"><strong>The Redemption of Michael K. Williams</strong></a> (NJ.com) — <em>A profile of the beloved actor, best known for playing Omar Little on the HBO series </em>The Wire<em>, who passed away Monday: “‘I suffered from a huge identity crisis,’ Williams says. ‘People say they love the characters I’ve chosen in my career. But I didn’t choose anything. I just happened to be working and these were offered to me. But when I look at the characters, I got to exorcise my demons, a lot. In the end, I was more comfortable with Omar’s skin than my own. That was a problem.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-other-afghan-women"><strong>The Other Afghan Women</strong></a> (New Yorker) — <em>“The longest war in American history ended on August 15th, when the Taliban captured Kabul without firing a shot. Bearded, scraggly men with black turbans took control of the Presidential palace, and around the capital the austere white flags of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan went up. Panic ensued. Some women burned their school records and went into hiding, fearing a return to the nineteen-nineties, when the Taliban forbade them to venture out alone and banned girls’ education. For Americans, the very real possibility that the gains of the past two decades might be erased appeared to pose a dreadful choice: recommit to seemingly endless war, or abandon Afghan women.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html"><strong>The Amazon That Customers Don’t See</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“In contrast to its precise, sophisticated processing of packages, Amazon’s model for managing people — heavily reliant on metrics, apps and chatbots — was uneven and strained even before the coronavirus arrived, with employees often having to act as their own caseworkers, interviews and records show. Amid the pandemic, Amazon’s system burned through workers, resulted in inadvertent firings and stalled benefits, and impeded communication, casting a shadow over a business success story for the ages.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/09/bad-news-selling-the-story-of-disinformation/"><strong>Bad News: Selling The Story Of Disinformation</strong></a> (Harper’s Magazine) — <em>“Behold, the platforms and their most prominent critics both proclaim: hundreds of millions of Americans in an endless grid, ready for manipulation, ready for activation. Want to change an output—say, an insurrection, or a culture of vaccine skepticism? Change your input. Want to solve the ‘crisis of faith in key institutions’ and the ‘loss of faith in evidence-based reality’? Adopt a better content-moderation policy. The fix, you see, has something to do with the algorithm.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/opinion/article-im-one-of-the-service-workers-who-left-the-restaurant-industry-during/"><strong>I’m One Of The Service Workers Who Left The Restaurant Industry During The Pandemic. Serve Yourself.</strong></a> (The Globe and Mail) — <em>“Let me shed some light on the ‘mystery’ of this labour shortage: With an abysmally low rate of pay, bad (often erratic) hours, no sick days and near-constant sexual harassment, racism, sexism and queerphobia, working in service sucks.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur"><strong>Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Many Countries. How Is That Possible?</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“The process of creating Bitcoin to spend or trade consumes around 91 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, more than is used by Finland, a nation of about 5.5 million.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.5280.com/2021/09/the-enduring-legacy-of-elijah-mcclains-tragic-death/"><strong>The Enduring Legacy of Elijah McClain’s Tragic Death</strong></a><strong></strong>(5280) — <em>“Nearly 1,300 miles away, in Denver, letters like Wischik’s came in a trickle, and then all at once. They came from places like Eagle River, Alaska, and Peaks Island, Maine; from Clay Center, Kansas, and Brooklyn, New York. The letters came from men and women and children, from a photographer in Kentucky who would use her letter to start a conversation with her mother about racial inequality; from a school nurse in Texas who lost friends when she posted a photo of her letter on Facebook; from a British architect in Atlanta who had never before mailed a letter in the United States; from a bodybuilder in Arkansas who had begun to chat about the Black Lives Matter movement during workouts. Almost a year later, in a room at History Colorado Center, seven white boxes at my side were filled with their words. I put a letter opener’s blade to one envelope after another. And I read.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/magazine/fbi-terrorism-terry-albury.html"><strong>“I Helped Destroy People”</strong></a> (New York Times Magazine) — <em>“‘I was very idealistic when I joined the F.B.I.,’ Albury says. ‘I really wanted to make the world a better place, and I stayed as long as I did because I continued to believe that I could help make things better, as naïve as that sounds. But the war on terror is like this game, right? We’ve built this entire apparatus and convinced the world that there is a terrorist in every mosque, and that every newly arrived Muslim immigrant is secretly anti-American, and because we have promoted that false notion, we have to validate it. So we catch some kid who doesn’t know his ear from his [expletive] for building a bomb fed to them by the F.B.I., or we take people from foreign countries where they have secret police and recruit them as informants and capitalize on their fear to ensure there is compliance. It’s a very dangerous and toxic environment, and we have not come to terms with the fact that maybe we really screwed up here.’”</em></p>
