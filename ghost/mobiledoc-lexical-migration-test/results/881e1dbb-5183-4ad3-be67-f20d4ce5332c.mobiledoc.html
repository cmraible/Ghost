<p>Cars & Bars is an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/collector-car-appreciation-day/">annual event</a> now in its fourth year where people pay $25 a head to check out some impressive car collections normally closed to the public. As is the case <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barber-vintage-festival-canceled/">with just about everything else these days</a>, the event has been forced into a virtual format. That’s especially true with the notoriously rigorous lockdown measures employed in Michigan, where this event is held. However, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/tour-some-virtual-auto-museums/">virtual format</a> means those of us in other parts of the country and world can check out surgeon Bobby Mukkamala’s collection.</p>

<p>Nestled among the 75 cars in Mukkamala’s collection is a 1986 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ferrari-testarossa-road-trip/">Ferrari Testarossa</a>, which have been appreciating in value quite a bit recently. However, this isn’t just any ol’ Testarossa but is THE car Sonny Crockett drove in <em>Miami Vice</em> back in the 80s. During the tour he’s going to tell the story of how he ended up with the famous car, which is probably an interesting tale.</p>

<p>Mukkamala is an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor) so we can imagine he’s done quite well for himself. His car collection testifies to that fact. We got a peek at some of the rides in his garage, and among them is a 1959 Chevrolet Corvette, 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, 1990 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, and a 1974 Jaguar E Type Series 3. One of the weirdest vehicles you can see in the preview is a lifted and otherwise modified Isuzu VehiCROSS, which is something of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-1943-willys-mb-jeep-travel-550-miles-off-road/">legend among off-roaders</a> in the know.</p>
