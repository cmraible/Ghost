          "There seem to be two approaches when Chip Foose does his Draws A Car YouTube series. One involves him either slamming the vehicle within an inch of the ground or jacking it way up, adding some stripes, then doing some other dramatic re-sculpting of the body, maybe chopping the roof off, etc. The guy’s other approach is to change hardly a damn thing, ostensibly because he feels the car is so perfect he can’t really improve upon it. Guess which approach he takes with the new "

I’m not sure his changes would fly with US DOT regulations not to mention the EU and other places, which unfortunately helps dictate the design of new cars to the point they all look increasingly alike. Personally, I think his changes are just kind of meh, not bad but not really that good, either. In a way it makes me wish he did something super crazy."

He then proceeds to forget the Mitsubishi 3000GT has the “GT” on the end of the name, because he’s such a fan and stuff. Or maybe someone didn’t write the cue cards correctly. I’ve done that job and it can be rough, especially when the on-screen talent can’t read good and other stuff."
