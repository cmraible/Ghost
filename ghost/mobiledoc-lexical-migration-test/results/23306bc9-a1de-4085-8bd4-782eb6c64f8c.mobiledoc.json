Both are the result of this car spending its entire life on the West Coast with just two owners who drove the car a total of just over 72,000 miles. Many of the parts are original to the car such as the engine, transmission interior, glass and even the spare tire. To ensure this classic Porsche is ready for any road trip, this 1975 Porsche 914 was recently serviced and it wears new tires and brakes as well a newer Blaupunkt stereo system."

This pampered, West Coast life is obvious in the overall condition with the paint, interior and event the undercarriage appearing in impressive condition. There's no doubt this 914 could be a show-winning Porsche today, but it's just a light restoration away from being a concours-quality car!"
