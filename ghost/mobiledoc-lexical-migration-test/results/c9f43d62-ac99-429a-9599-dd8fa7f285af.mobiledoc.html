<p>Major League Baseball legend Jose Canseco made $45 million over his very long career. With that kind of money, he certainly had cash to waste, and while we wouldn’t exactly say this car is a waste, it certainly requires someone to have left over money to want to make it. The baseball player bought the 1999 Acura NSX, and then had it converted into <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rare-lamborghini-diablo/">Lamborghini Diablo</a> GT. This oddball ‘Lambo’ just sold for $126,1000 on eBay.</p>

<p>The mash up car was listed with an initial reserve price of $175K, but failed to sell at that price. It ended up being sold for $126k. Seeing that it’s built on an Acura NSX platform, it’s really a pretty impressive build. The dimensions are spot on and a lot of parts come from Lamborghini OEM, which includes the scissor doors and emblems.</p>

<p>Custom parts were made specifically for this build and are very convincing. The roof-mounted air-intake, in-body lights, and a spoiler really sell the build. Under the hood, you’re going to start to feel disappointment as the NSX 6-cylinder engine remains in place, there’s no magical 12 cylinder, high-revving engine like that 570 horsepower and 465 lb-ft Diablo GT’s engine. Instead, the manual transmission car only makes a fraction of that at 270 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty clever knock-off, and much cheaper than the real thing that goes for $950K in the market, but imagine if someone tried to race you to find out it’s a fake? Ouch!</p>
