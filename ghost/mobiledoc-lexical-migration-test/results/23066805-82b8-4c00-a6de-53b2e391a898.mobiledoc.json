Of course, we know the reason was the guy put diesel in the tank, but he thought it was just a British supercar being cranky. Yeah, that’s definitely a thing, but not this time. An F1 specialist who happened to be in town came to take a look but couldn’t diagnose the problem."

Now, anyone can absentmindedly do something stupid when distracted, but we have to say we’ve never confused a diesel pump for a gas pump. The handles here in America are green and it’s something you’d absolutely notice. According to the internet, in the UK diesel pump handles and hoses are black, setting them apart from the green handles on the gas or petrol pumps. But in this story the guy says the nozzle he grabbed was blue, so apparently that means it was diesel? Our apologies if that isn’t correct – we haven’t refueled in Jolly Ol’ England and so we’re relying on second-hand info."
