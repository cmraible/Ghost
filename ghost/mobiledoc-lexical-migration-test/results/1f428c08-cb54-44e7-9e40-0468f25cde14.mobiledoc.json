          ", you play as an otter… called Charlie… in space… on a mission that takes him through a galaxy of fictional planetary levels. Charlie is part of a team of otternauts (that’s what they call them in this game, I didn’t just make it up) who are sent away on an intergalactic adventure for the greater good of mankind. The gameplay focuses on zero-gravity movement which gives an interesting spin on the usual adventure/platformer formula, and makes for some fun and original gameplay concepts."

The zero-gravity means that you can either propel Charlie from wall A to wall B in a straight line or if you hold down the jetpack button, you can direct Charlie freely through the air and deviate from the straight-line A to B trajectory; however the jet pack has limited fuel, which slowly replenishes, meaning the free-movement is cleverly yet fiendishly limited."

You begin with a small laser cannon but you can later collect additional guns like powerful missile launchers or a reflector ray for which the bullets reflect off certain surfaces, meaning you can shoot around corners; this becomes handy in both combat and puzzle solving situations. There are numerous item blueprints to find and in-game currency in the shape of nuts and bolts; the currency can be exchanged with the Build Bot (found at various locations throughout the levels) in order to build and upgrade items that you’ve found the aforementioned blueprints for."

There’s never anything particularly taxing but it normally involves shooting a certain button to open a timed door. There are also air currents to work against and other intriguing obstacles that come in your way; some surfaces are heated/lava and cause damage to Charlie, meaning you have to be careful with where you land him. All of the different puzzles and environmental obstacles combine nicely along with a steady difficulty curve, meaning that the experience is balanced perfectly between challenge and frustration."

          "The game is broken up into levels/planets with a hub spaceship where your otter crew hangs out. With an element of non-linearity which I really enjoyed, there is always the next objective to follow which progresses the story, however throughout the game, you can find maps for new planets and you can take your ship to said planets once discovered. This means that instead of the main objective planets, you can choose to explore alternative ones for extra items and currency. For clarity – the actual gameplay progression within any given level is quite linear but it’s when you choose which planet to go to next that the game really opens up."

          " is an exception to this trend. The story is very emotive and relevant with today’s environmental challenges that the world is currently experiencing – it begins with a cutscene whereby the humans have left Earth, having saturated it with rubbish and plastic-filled oceans. As a result, the animals are left to fend for themselves and the otter species take it upon themselves to start a space programme to explore and find alternative planets to inhabit. The story is vividly told and is both funny and sad at the same time, providing some welcomed depth. The otters are also extremely cute which compels you to help out Charlie and his furry friends."

Any given level can look a bit samey as you progress but once you move onto the next, you’re greeted by a new and colourful style which reinvigorates your interest. The character design is really strong as well and forms a unique personality for the otter clan."

If you’re not going to make a stellar soundtrack, then at least don’t make it annoying, and the developers ticked that box. I’ll admit that that doesn’t sound particularly flattering but honestly, functional is the best way to describe the music in this game, and that’s not a criticism by any means."

It rewards you with solid gameplay and a fairly sizable single-player campaign relative to its price. The emotive but cute story is also a very welcome addition to the Switch. My only criticism is that the game can get a bit repetitive at times but all-in-all, this is a fun twist on the platforming genre."
