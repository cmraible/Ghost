The multi-agency theft patrol made the bust in the Fife area, which is located by Tacoma. Working in coordinated fashion, they descended on the area and scooped up the vehicles and suspects, hopefully putting a dent into car theft and other crimes in the area."

The questionable choices didn’t stop there, as police say they found hundreds of pills they suspect are fentanyl inside along with $6,800 in cash. They also determined a false VIN plate was installed and before long determined the real VIN and where the Chevy was stolen. A 28-year-old male suspect who somehow was attached to the car, they don’t say if he was inside while it was parked at a motel, was arrested thanks to having warrants for felony assault and firearms."
