The lights are not hazy and contain no cracks in them. The truth is that this vehicle is in excellent condition. Not only is the outside impeccable, but the Grey cloth interior is admirable as well. The seats and carpet are virtually like new and show almost no wear and tear. All aspects and features work; the air blows cold, the radio sounds pristine, and the locks work without issue."

The car is bone stock and has never been raced or modified in any way. The engine runs as strongly and smoothly as it did right off the dealer lot. The transmission is tight and precise, with responsive steering that holds its weight on the road for a quality ride. To boot, the oil was just changed and a mechanic has inspected the car to a T."
