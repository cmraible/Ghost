<hr>
<p>With the UK’s seatbelt law just turning 40 years-old, police are reminding everyone about the consequences of being a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/europe-shame-speeding-drivers/">scofflaw</a>, including classic car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-ev-owners/">drivers</a>. If you aren’t aware, the fine for driving without a belt on is up to £500. For anyone who owns an older vehicle, it’s key they know the law well or they could be paying a hefty fine.</p>
<p><strong>See what happens when you don’t wear a seatbelt <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-tumbles-out-camaro/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>If a classic car was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-government-classic-car-buyers/">made before 1966</a>, nobody is required to be belted in, according to a report from Express. However, children under the age of 3 can’t travel in the vehicle. Children over 3 are required to ride in the backseat. Ultimately, the driver gets to choose if any kids can go for a spin in their car, instead of big daddy government making that call.</p>
<p>Drivers in the UK are responsible for any passengers under 14 who aren’t wearing a seatbelt. Everyone else caught will be fined separately. However, there are laws about younger children riding in a child car seat or booster.</p>
<p>While not everyone agrees the government in the UK and other countries should be forcing people to wear a seatbelt, a survey conducted found most British drivers support even stricter seatbelt laws. We can’t vouch for the validity of the survey, but considering the oodles of traffic/speed cameras and other big brother provisions drivers in the UK put up with in the name of keeping everyone safe in proverbial bubble wrap, we wouldn’t be surprised to find out the results are accurate.</p>
<p>We just want to know if police officers in the UK can tell the difference between a 1965 and 1966 for many different car models? How do they know if they should pull someone over and issue a citation? After they pull someone over because they’re not wearing a seatbelt? Wouldn’t this make driving a 1965 or even a 1964 or 1963 classic car annoying? Please, if you’re in the UK and regularly drive something right on the bubble for the seatbelt law, let us know if you get pulled over often for not being belted in.</p>
