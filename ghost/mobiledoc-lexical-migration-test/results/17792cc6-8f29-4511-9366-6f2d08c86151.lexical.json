It is impossible not to have fun in one of these monsters, that hyper-responsive throttle and engine that pulls like a bat out of hell leave people with a constant smile on their face. In this particular case, the greatest personality trait of Dodge owners was showcased quite well, their wonderful sense of humor, at least when they're not getting chased by cops.",

She commented that the car was going slow due to the snow and, as if on cue, the charger floored the pedal letting out the roar from two monstrous revs before slowing down again.
