The 1962 Chrysler 300 is heavily patina-clad and even more heavily modified. Under the hood is a V10 Viper engine paired with a manual transmission. The suspension is modified as well and features a fully adjustable airbag system. The interior can only be described as a custom masterpiece that made good use of a bead roller. The leather upholstery is masterfully done and the dash has been returned to its original glory.",

It is truly fascinating seeing the guys at Classic Car Studio Speed Shop transform this rusted out roller into an incredibly fast low-rider with the perfect balance of style and patina. Even if the patina finish and bead rolled interior is not your thing, it's hard to argue that it’s not fitting for this car. It is also hard to not imagine how good this car would look with a super shiny paint job as well.
