<p>This post by JP Rangaswami resonated with me, because it summed up one of the <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2017/10/30/on-platforms-and-sustainability/">areas digital seems to have gone wrong</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>So is that it? Back to seats and eyeballs, channelled not connected, “audiences” sucking up linear “content”? Back to a time where discourse wasn’t possible, where law-of-the-jungle-might-was-right, and visceral emotion was the preferred means of communication?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a deep irony in the fact that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter <em>et al</em> have simplified the tools of the Web 2.0 era to the point where they’ve re-created the conditions of the pre-social web – but with lower barriers to entry.</p>
<p>And that means that the determined, and the well-funded, can start reshaping what was once personal discourse in a controlled fashion. Essentially, we’ve created the conditions for highly politicised propaganda to insert itself into people’s normals social interactions, <em>without them noticing</em>.</p>
<p>And much that is bad has stemmed from that.</p>
