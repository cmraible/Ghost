This time has been confirmed by past record-holder Ed Bolian, but some past Cannonballers (as well as the \"official\" Instagram account) have come forward saying that the record shouldn't stand because it was unfairly attempted while taking advantage of the empty streets â€“ the result of a nationwide stay-at-home order."

          "The idea of bunch of law breakers scoffing at another law breaker for breaking the law is laughable, but it's also funny that these people are upset because the record was broken during an advantageous window. Keep in mind that most modern teams use advanced technologies and a network of spotters, which weren't available when Erwin \"Cannon Ball\" Baker first drove from New York to L.A. in 1933 or when this race started an underground cult in the '70s, to assist with high-speed runs. So what's wrong with taking advantage of greatly reduced highway traffic?"
