<hr>
<p>The allure of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-racers-street-takeover/">racing someone else</a> is pretty strong, but we absolutely advise against <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-racing-camaro-wrecks/">street racing</a>. In yet another example of why it’s a bad idea, a man from South Daytona Beach, Florida was recently sentenced to 15 years in prison after he crashed his 2010 Chevy Camaro into another car, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/street-race-arizona-deadly/">fatally injuring</a> a 73-year-old woman. No race is worth that.</p>

<p>It was on June 4, 2019 that now 27-year-old Erik Worthington decided to use his Camaro to race a Subaru of all things. Yes, we know there are fast STIs but come on! Police say he was traveling up to 114 mph leading up to the crash, speeds nobody should be going in a city.</p>
<p>Police were able to get dashcam footage from another driver in the area, which clearly showed the victim pull up to a stop sign, then turn left onto a main road in her Cadillac Escalade. She didn’t see the street racers barreling towards her, who had to both swerve at the last minute.</p>
<p>Worthington hit the front driver’s side corner of the Escalade, sending the big luxury SUV into a spin and flip onto its roof. While the woman inside survived initially, she died several hours later in the hospital.</p>
<p>As for the driver of the Subaru, police say 30-year-old Anthony Panos fled the scene but was later apprehended. He faced charges for leaving the scene of a crash with a death, vehicular homicide, and racing on a highway. Panos’ attorney argued before a judge that since his car didn’t actually hit the Escalade charges should’ve been dismissed. Shockingly, that maneuver worked as Panos’ attorney argued that his client was actually racing the Camaro. We don’t have all the details of the courtroom proceedings, but that’s pretty interesting.</p>
