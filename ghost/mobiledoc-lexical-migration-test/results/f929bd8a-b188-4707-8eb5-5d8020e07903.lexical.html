<div>**Do:**</div>
<div></div>
<div>1. **Be great!** – Niche websites work, they can capture audiences. All of our content is exclusively written by professional journalists – it’s about high-quality content.2. **Search engine optimise** – 5,395 pages – 75% of traffic comes from Google.3. **Know your market and products** – make sure you know who your advertisers will be and target them with research, clear suite of products. Keep clear differentiation between ad and ed. 4. **Establish a clear sales strategy** – Either divide your role to focus on sales some of the time, or get a professional. Make the process as easy as possible – and provide great reporting. 5. **Forge partnerships** – work with radio and print. Syndicate your content in a controlled fashion – but cash is almost always better than a contra deal. <div>**Don’t**</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>1. **Compromise your model** – stick to the plan2. **Be afraid to stand up for yourself** – lots and lots of problems with plagiarism. 25 organisations have plagiarised 200 individual infringement.3. **Spend all your time on Twitter** – make sure your social media activity is bringing you an audience and money.4. **Rely on UGC** – think this decade will see a resurgence in professional journalism5. **Stop moving forwards** – Redesign coming, iPhone app, franchise model for sites…<div>And this is their most popular video:</div>
