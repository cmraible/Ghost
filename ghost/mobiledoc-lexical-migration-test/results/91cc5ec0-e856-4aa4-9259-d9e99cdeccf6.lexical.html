<p>Under the hood of the custom restomod <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS19">1961 Chevrolet Corvette</a> convertible is a 376ci LS3 V8 engine mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. A fully independent suspension underpinning ensures a modern ride and a french stitched leather interior provides a luxurious comfort. Painted a beautiful silver over red, this Corvette was masterfully restored with SEMA quality. Money was no object during the process and the cost exceeded $250,000. Besides the style, this car is almost as modern feeling as the brand new <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS19">2021 C8 Corvette</a> that will be accompanying it.</p>

<p>Thanks to the mid-engine design, the <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS19">C8 Corvette</a> is the fastest, most powerful base-level Corvette that Chevrolet has ever built. However, the one being given away by Dream Giveaway is not a base model. It features nearly all of the high-priced add-ons offered by Chevrolet, including the Z51 performance and suspension packages and the 3LT premium equipment package.</p>
