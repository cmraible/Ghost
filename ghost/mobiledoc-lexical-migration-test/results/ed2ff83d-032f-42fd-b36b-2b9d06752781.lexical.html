<p>Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg were luxury-minded automakers that produced hand-assembled vehicles rather than relying on mass production, and the museum is housed in the Auburn Automobile Company's former headquarters building. All three companies ceased operations in 1937, but the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum was opened on July 6, 1974 in Auburn, Indiana to preserve the original buildings as well as the heritage of these high-end automakers. Just 45 years later, this museum has grown to be the largest museum of its kind housing 140 vintage and antique vehicles and attracting attracting over 40,000 visitors a year.</p>
<p>In 2005, the U.S. National Parks Service designated this '30s-era Art Deco museum as a National Historic Landmark as a National Historic Landmark, and efforts such as this <a href="https://auburncordmuseum.tapkat.org/wina1963corvettestingray/" rel="nofollow noopener">Corvette-giveaway fundraiser</a> will help ensure the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum will be around for future generations to enjoy.</p>
