<p>Walk around this V-Spec II and you’ll notice the paint as well as the dash and other interior pieces don’t show sun fading or other weather damage, so likely this Nissan was garaged its entire life. The previous owner added some very nice mods to this Skyline GT-R V-Spec II, enhancing its looks and performance. Among them is that prominent East Bear carbon-fiber hood, white Volk TE37 Wheels, Bridgestone Potenza tires, N1 front bumper/rear trunk lip, Ganador mirrors, Greddy Coilovers, and front tension arms. Under the hood are HKS intakes, HKS EVC, MAF delete, Nismo N1 twin turbos, ARC front-mount intercooler, aluminum radiator, air oil separator, and an oil filter relocation kit. R34 GT-R engine covers dress things up nicely.</p>
<p>You’ll find the interior of this car is just as clean as the exterior, with plenty of original touches. Some tasteful modifications enhance the ride, making it more enjoyable for you as the driver. For example, there’s a nice Momo steering wheel and Defi Gauge Suite for reading critical items like water temperature, engine oil temperature, boost, and oil pressure quickly.

<p>Originally, Nissan created the R32 GT-R for homologation requirements in Group A racing. The motorsports success helped fuel strong sales and Nissan rode the wave, selling many times more cars than necessary. Quite a few enthusiasts consider the R32 to be one of the best Japanese performance cars ever, thanks to its balanced handling and the highly tunable engine.</p>
