<p>The comic will release in Japan on June 11th for ¥2,640 and sold from the Hobonichi store and two weeks later, will then see a full Japanese release in various retail outlets. </p>
<p>If you haven’t watched the video until the very end, you may have missed it saying “To Be Continued..”, which may point towards even more Mother news later this year.</p>
