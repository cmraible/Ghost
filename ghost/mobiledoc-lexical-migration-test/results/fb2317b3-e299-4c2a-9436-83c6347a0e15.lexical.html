<hr>
<p>Four people have been arrested in Michigan after they were accused of stealing four Dodges <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-target-dealership/">from a dealership</a> in Highland Township. The total value of those Dodges is over $329,000 so it’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/million-in-cars-stolen/">big deal</a> in the community. What’s more, one of the accused thieves is only 15 years-old, which is something we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/teens-ohio-car-theft-spree/">see all too often</a> these days.</p>
<blockquote><em>Thieves are stealing these cars directly from the factory, which you can see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-durango-hellcats/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The four vehicles stolen are a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-durango-hellcats/">2021 Dodge Durango Hellcat</a>, 2021 Dodge Durango GT, 2017 Dodge Charger Hellcat, and 2021 Ram TRX. Ok, so the Ram isn’t a Dodge, but most people still count them as Dodges and they’re in the same dealership, plus the TRX uses the Hellcat engine. </p>

<p>After breaking into the dealership and gaining access to the keys, these four suspects reportedly drove all of the vehicles out the showroom by crashing through the glass wall. That’s not the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/hellcat-stolen-with-ease/">least bit elegant</a>, but we’re sure they thought it was cool at the time.</p>
<p>Oakland County Sheriff’s Auto Theft Unit responded to the call from the dealership and launched an investigation. They were able to track down the Durango Hellcat down to a location in Birmingham, we assume using the factory GPS unit. Police found three men driving in the high-powered crossover, who then tried to outrun the cops, but the driver ended up crashing into a brick wall instead.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the three men in the Durango Hellcat weren’t the original thieves. Instead, they paid the thieves $5,000 cash for it. Officers found $5,800 in cash, a handgun, and a key fob reprogramming device in the crossover.</p>
<p>The other three cars have also been recovered. Authorities say they’re working to identify the original thieves and bring them to justice. They believe the same people have been doing smash-and-grab thefts <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rappers-range-rover-stolen/">at gas stations</a> in Waterford and White Lake.</p>
<p>Car thieves love targeting dealerships these days, particularly Dodge dealers, like they’re kids in a candy shop. Why dealers haven’t invested in more secure storage solutions for keys is beyond us, but for some reason their cost-benefit analysis must tell them paying more for insurance is worth not taking on the expense.</p>
