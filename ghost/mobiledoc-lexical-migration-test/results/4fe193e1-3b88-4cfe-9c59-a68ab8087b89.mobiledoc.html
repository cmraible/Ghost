<hr>
<p>The term “Frankenstein car” is used a lot in the industry, usually when someone takes something off one car and puts it on a very different kind of vehicle. While that certainly can be jarring, this creation known as the Chevy 789 takes parts from 3 different classic Chevrolets and mixes them together for one crazy look. It’s something which people will definitely stare at, whether in horror or out of fascination.</p>

<p>Created by Gene Langmesser in California, the Chevy 789 stared life as a brand new Corvette. The guy wasn’t content with the looks, so he chopped it up and added parts from a ’57, ’58, and ’59 Chevy as well as what he claims is “1500 lbs. of clay” (really it’s carbon fiber and fiberglass) to come up with what you see.</p>

<p>What you’re presented with is something which looks classic in many ways, but also has an odd modern vibe to it. We’re somewhat reminded of some of the retro-style cars to emerge around the change of the millennium, and yet it’s still different.</p>
<p>Just like the name indicates, the front end of this creation is lifted in part from a ’57 Chevy. Sure, it looks a little different since it had to be morphed to fit the chassis. The middle of the car is a ’58 Chevy, and the rear is obviously from a ’59 Chevy with the distinctive wings. All these looks were melded together into one, something which we’re sure wasn’t easy to pull off.</p>

<p>Sadly, the interior is the kind of low-rent fare you’ve come to expect from GM. It’s disappointing to see those seats and plenty of plastic after being presented with such a unique, interesting exterior. We hope Langmesser sees fit to continue working on the Chevy 789 by revamping that space with something more vintage.</p>
