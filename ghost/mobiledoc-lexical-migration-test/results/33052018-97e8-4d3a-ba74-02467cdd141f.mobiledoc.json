Hidden away is a Stage 3 cam, which you might never guess has been installed since the intake manifolds are stock and everything from the outside looks pretty tame. However, the owner says this setup is pushing 420-whp, so it’s not exactly weak. We have to respect the man installed a Tremec 5-speed manual instead of opting for an automatic."
