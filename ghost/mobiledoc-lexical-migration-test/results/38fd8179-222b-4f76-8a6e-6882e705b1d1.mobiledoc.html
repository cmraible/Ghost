<p>The best part about being a racing enthusiast is that there is no limit as to what type of vehicle you can race, and this off-road buggy is a perfect example. This <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2015-off-road-armory-eurofighter-ultra-4-race-buggy-2/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2015 Off-Road Armoury Eurofighter</a> competed in numerous off-road racing events in Europe in 2016 and 2017, and now it's up for grabs on <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Bring a Trailer</a> with a no-reserve auction.</p>

<p>Riding on a 112-inch wheelbase with a 82.5-inch track width, this four-wheel-drive off-road buggy is powered by a 4.3-liter Toyota V8 rated at more than 400 horsepower, while the four-wheel disc brakes with drilled and slotted rotors help this buggy stop on a dime. This bad boy is not street legal, but it has been officially imported for competition use such as King of the Hammers and comes with proper EPA documentation.</p>
<p>With intentions of running such a rigorous race, it's no surprise this buggy is built so solid. To ensure that it is ready for anything, the buggy features a rigid tubular chassis, solid axles (sourced from a Nissan Patrol) with air-locking differentials front and rear, a 32-gallon fuel cell and a 9,500-pound winch. The equipment list includes just about everything a race team would need to tackle the most challenging of off-road events, and that includes the racing seats with racing harnesses as well as a proper navigator's cockpit featuring an in-dash computer and a sturdy grab bar.</p>
<p>Back in October 2019, this buggy was <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">up for grabs on BaT</a>, but it failed to sell with a high bid of $25,550. This time around, the 2015 Off-Road Armoury Eurofighter will definitely be heading off to a new home with a no-reserve auction, so be sure you're <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/account/register/bid/?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fbringatrailer.com%2Flisting%2F2015-off-road-armory-eurofighter-ultra-4-race-buggy-2%2F%3Fprompttm%3D1%23listing-bid-container">registered to bid</a> before the auction for this serious off-road racing machine closes on Thursday, July 9th.</p>
