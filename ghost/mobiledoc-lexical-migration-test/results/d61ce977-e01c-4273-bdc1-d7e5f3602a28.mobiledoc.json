          " is still considered an icon among enthusiasts today. Its subdued understated elegance mixed with the most powerful V8 option for the SL-Class at the time, made it one of the most commercially successful Mercedes vehicles up to that point. The most desirable of the four year model was its last year. In 1989, the 560SL stood for the best that Mercedes-Benz had to offer and for many enthusiasts, this is a sentiment that still rings true today. With less than 6,000 examples being produced, a clean low-mileage example from 1989 is hard to find. Especially "

There are only around 14,000 original miles on this car and it is cosmetically and mechanically sound. While it may look like it, this 560SL has never been restored. The paint, soft Mushroom leather interior, and legendary drive train is in as close to new condition as can be expected with a 32-year old car. This is an incredible opportunity to add this iconic Mercedes-Benz to your collection. For more information, "
