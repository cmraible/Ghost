<p>“Recirculation” is the sort of fancy word that most journalists, quite rightly, turn their noses up at. It’s a horrible piece of jargon for a simple idea: getting people to reading more stuff once they arrive at our sites.</p>
<p>However, it remains a significant challenge in many newsrooms. All too often, I come across pieces with not a single internal link or other means of encouraging people to explore what we have to offer. Conversely, sometimes the reverse is true: the page is so plastered with links to newsletters, podcasts and other stories, it looks like the site has no confidence in the actual article people are reading.</p>
<p>Finding a happy medium is critical — especially for membership model sites, which need to push people towards enough of a habit that they’ll convert.</p>
<h3 id="the-mobile-recirculation-challenge">The mobile recirculation challenge</h3>
<p>And so, this piece from Chartbeat, is useful stuff, especially in terms of thinking about <em>mobile</em> strategies, rather than desktop ones:</p>
<blockquote>Reader scroll patterns on mobile devices differ from their desktop counterparts — how you show the depth of your content is critical to keeping them engaged in these experiences.</blockquote>
<p>Worth taking some time out with a cup of tea to dig into this and, in particular, to following a lot of the links (which will create recirculation on the Chartbeat site… see how that works? 😜)</p>

<p>Reviews are a highly competitive category, but a very search-friendly one. If you’re running them, and especially if you’re using affiliate links as a revenue source, it’s worth watching this.</p>
