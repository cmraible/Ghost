<p>Two short police chases and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-driver-pulled-over/">traffic stop</a> marked the dramatic end to an investigation into who stole a bunch of beer and a cargo truck from a train car in Fontana, California in the middle of the March. According to the police department, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-dealership-robbed-police/">investigation</a> had been going on for a “few nights” after the theft of the truck and hundreds of cases of Modelo were reported.</p>

<p>What’s really hilarious about this case is in the photos you can see the Nissan Titan had cases of Modelo stacked up like someone went to Costco and got a little crazy there in preparation for one huge party. How they thought the cops wouldn’t spot something so obvious is mind boggling, but a lot of criminals aren’t very bright.</p>

<p>A crossover is pictured with several cases of beer stacked in the cargo area. At least that wasn’t as obvious. However, even more creative is the photo of Modelo cases in the backseat of a car as if they’re some sort of passenger. That’s almost as bad as using an inflatable decoration to drive in the carpool lane.</p>
<p>Ultimately, 7 people were arrested after the police chases and traffic stop, so Fontana Police are chalking this up as a win. We don’t know how much of the beer was seized and how much might have been consumed prior to the bust.</p>

<p>Whatever the answer, having that much Modelo in a vehicle is definitely going to weigh it down. We don’t know which ones ran from the cops, but we can see why the chases were short, what with all that beer sloshing around and taxing the engine. Now if only Fontana Police would get a hot lead and bust that designer jeans counterfeit ring.</p>
