<p>Today's philosophical conundrum: Did the popularity of early SUVs lay the groundwork for the proliferation of modern SUVs, or did the popularity of modern SUVs make classics like <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31103/1972-chevrolet-blazer-k5?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this 1972 Chevrolet K5 Blazer</a> more popular? It's a chicken/egg scenario for sure, but either way, classic SUVs like the Ford Bronco and Chevy Blazer are red hot in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/future-collector-car-market/">collector car market</a> right now.</p>

<p>This classic two-tone <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31103/1972-chevrolet-blazer-k5?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">orange and white K5 Blazer</a> was recently subjected to a full restoration. No detail was an afterthought, and the end result is a truck that looks far nicer than any factory original truck ever did.</p>
<p>The first generation of <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31103/1972-chevrolet-blazer-k5?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">K5 Blazers</a> shared their styling with the beloved "Action Line" pickups of 1967-1972. Unlike later Blazers, these first-generation K5 Blazers were all full convertibles. Partway into the second generation, the Blazer would switch to a "half-cab" design with a removable cap over the rear seats. it was certainly safer and more watertight, but a whole lot less fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31103/1972-chevrolet-blazer-k5?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This K5 Blazer</a> is particularly well-equipped. The cockpit is a pleasant place to see the great outdoors, thanks to the bucket seats with a center console and armrest, and the factory air conditioning certainly makes it more comfortable in the summer.</p>
<p>You'll also find a tilt steering column and power steering, as well as disc brakes at all four corners. One recent, non-factory addition is a Bluetooth stereo. There's also a <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31103/1972-chevrolet-blazer-k5?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">4" lift kit</a> installed, as well as substantially larger off-road tires.</p>
