<p>Jacque Trevini, who lives in Cave Creek, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/arizona-man-dwarf-cars/">Arizona</a>, recently tried to renew the registration on her <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/refurbished-1965-porsche-356/">1963 Porsche 356 B</a>, but the state MVD told her the car no longer exists. It’s a bizarre situation, especially since Trevini and her husband have owned the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cubed-porsche-911/">classic Porsche</a> for the past 20 years, never once having problems with its registration.</p>

<p>If a government agency says a car doesn’t exist, does it cease existing? That’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/another-car-stolen-dumb-reason/">ridiculous</a> question, of course, but this is indeed a ridiculous situation. That’s exactly what the Trevinis thought, so they went home, jumped in the Porsche 356 B and returned to the MVD to show <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-z06-burnout/">how wrong they were</a>.</p>
<p>That’s when according to Jacque an MVD employee went outside with them, looked at the classic car, and told them that even though it obviously exists, they can’t drive it on public roads. The reason: it was already registered in Washington State.</p>

<p>After insisting they’ve never lived in Washington and arguing with MVD employees for weeks, the Trevinis had enough and contacted the local news, which ran a story on their predicament. While doing an investigation for the story, journalists uncovered that the same 6-digit VIN for the Porsche was used to register a 1933 Ford in Washington.</p>
<p>Because the VIN was used for another car in a different state, the Arizona MVD system flagged the Porsche’s title as cancelled. As a spokesman told the local news, it’s a feature which is supposed to prevent fraud. We know all about rampant fraud these days, including <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/vehicle-cloning-on-rise-florida/">rebirthing </a>cars. However, this doesn’t sound like a case of the Trevinis trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes. In fact, with such short VINs used back in the day, it’s not uncommon for them to be duplicated, especially when the cars were made in different countries.</p>
<p>Thankfully, because of the insight brought about by local journalists, the MVD removed the flag, allowing the 1963 Porsche 356 B’s registration to be renewed. Now the Trevinis can drive their classic car on public roads without fear of legal consequences.</p>
