It probably isn’t to everyone’s personal taste, but the 2013 C6 Corvette pulls off the look surprisingly well. Not only does it wear the split rear window, everything from the bumpers to the badging, wheels, and front fender vents are reminiscent of the first production year of the C2. What’s more, the body is made of lightweight carbon fiber. It’s obvious the guys at CRC, which built this car, are huge ‘Vette nuts who really know the cars well."
