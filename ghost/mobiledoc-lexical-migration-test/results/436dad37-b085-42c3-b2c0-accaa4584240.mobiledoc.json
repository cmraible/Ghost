Sure, Champlin and crew got ‘er running, but she’s probably not in the best condition for pushing extreme horsepower and torque."

Too many YouTubers have an ego the size of Texas, so if anyone says anything about them they interpret as being critical, they flip their lid. Instead, Champlin is cracking jokes about himself, like saying the supercharger is heavier than is last girlfriend. Done appropriately, self-deprecation can be hilarious and he knows how to pull it off."
