<p>As the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">car theft rash</a>which started in 2020 as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">COVID-19 lockdowns began</a> has spilled into 2021, we continue to see stories of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/feds-bust-car-theft-ring/">sophisticated groups</a> which have boosted quite a few vehicles. However, a couple out of the UK has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-man-luxury-auto-theft/">swiped an impressive number</a> of luxury rides, according to authorities, with the total value surpassing £1,000,000. Both Jouzas Baltors, 28, and Darius Lukauskas, 31, have been apprehended and now their alleged crimes are on full display.</p>
<p>According to police, the pair stole 26 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-steals-over-50-luxury-cars/">luxury cars</a> including BMWs, Range Rovers, Audis, and other high-end models in Reading, Bracknell, and 10 counties in under 100 days. These two weren’t just breaking the glass and hotwiring the cars like a couple of amateurs, either. They had one of those relay devices which can pick up the signal from a person’s key fob, then replicate it to defeat the keyless entry and ignition.</p>
<p>That means to anyone watching what they were doing, these two appeared to have the keys to any particular car, so nothing looked off. They could drive the vehicles to a location of their choosing without problems. Likely they used a jammer to keep the onboard GPS system from broadcasting the vehicle location.</p>
<p>As you probably already guessed, the luxury cars were taken straight to a chop shop for some cosmetic surgery, otherwise known as a complete slaughter. Considering most cars are worth more in pieces than complete, It’s a good scheme, that is until you get caught.</p>
<p>Both Baltors and Lukauskas were convincted of conspiracy to steal vehicles after going through a 7-day trial. Those Brits definitely don’t mess around when it comes to car theft. In addition, Baltors was convicted of breaching a deportation order after being deported in February of last year.</p>
