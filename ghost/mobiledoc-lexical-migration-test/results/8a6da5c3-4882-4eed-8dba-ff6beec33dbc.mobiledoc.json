Features such as an under-hood mounted spare tire, a Halo-twin roof, a dual-range four-wheel-drive, and a manually adjustable ride height were among the Brat’s best features. However, it was the rally-inspired stripe package and the unique rear-facing jump seats that garnered the most attention. Although many buyers opted to remove the seats and carpet from the bed in favor of more cargo space and less of a chance of rust."
