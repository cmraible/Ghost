If I care about my readers – and I do – I should be catering to their device choice.\n\nAlso, frankly, when I’m talking to publishers and journalists about mobile strategy, having a design that’s not mobile-friendly was getting rather embarrassing.\n\n\n## What’s changed?\n\n- **Responsive design!** Yes, I said that above. But it’s the most important thing…\n- **The sidebar returns**. Yes, I tried to bury it all at the bottom of the page, but it didn’t work. A single sidebar is still useful.\n- **Sharing buttons are gone**. An experiment: I want to see if the lack of sharing buttons has any traffic impact.\n- **Pagingation**. You can actually (at long last) page back through older entries from the homepage of the site.\n- **Taupy RIP**. Yes, the lizard finally bites the dust. Here, for a final time, is Taupy, the mascot of this blog for the best part of eight years:\n\n![taupy.png](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/04/taupy1.png?resize=185%2C184)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n"
