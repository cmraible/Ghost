Connecting the engine to the massive back tires is a two-speed Powerglide transmission that clearly helps the dragster focus on the track. Down the quarter-mile, this thing is pushing a 9.4 second ET at 140mph, with the Demon having a quarter-mile time of around 9.65 seconds. The 2011 Dodge Drag Pack takes the win being that it is 0.4 seconds faster than the 2018 Dodge Demon. With no VIN, a fatality waver, and a full cage set up for safety, it becomes clear that this is a race car through and through. "

Under the car itself, youâ€™ll find a suspension kit set up only for drag racing, even going as far as to not have sway bars. It is refreshing to see that Dodge has always been about speed even in the early days of the modern-day muscle car."
