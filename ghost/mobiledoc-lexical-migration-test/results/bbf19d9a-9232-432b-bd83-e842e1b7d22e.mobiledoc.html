<hr>
<p>To us, there's something inherently charming about a restored <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1940-dodge-vf-32-hot-rod/">classic pickup truck</a>. Unlike <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/datsun-280zs-first-bath-44-years/">classic sports cars</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-is-the-first-1969-hurst-olds-442/">muscle cars</a>, trucks were expect to earn their keep. They weren't typically treated with much care.</p>
<p>Many lived a hard life, and were used for work until they were worn out and thrown away. Seeing an old <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ls-powered-pickup-carries-loads/">truck</a> in gleaming, restored condition makes us feel like it's enjoying a well-deserved retirement.</p>

<p>That seems to be the case with this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213537/1950-chevrolet-half-ton-3100">1950 Chevy 3100 pickup</a>. These are known as Chevrolet Advance Design trucks, and to many, they're the quintessential classic pickup.</p>
<p>The truck seen here is said to be a great driver with many new parts. The ad lists fresh brakes, exhaust, battery, wheels and tires. There's also a new carburetor perched atop the inline six cylinder engine.</p>

<p>Behind that six cylinder, you'll find a four speed manual transmission. It may not seem very exotic, but a variation of this engine found its way under the hood of the 1953, 1954, and 1955 Corvettes until the then-new small block V8 stole the show.</p>
<p>In this application, it's torquey and reliable, which is all anyone wanted or needed out of a pickup truck back then. Sure, you won't set any speed records, but you won't be stressed out about maintenance, either.</p>

<p>That's especially true in the case of this truck. The ad states that it's excellent to drive, runs quiet, and is very smooth. In addition, the all steel, two-tone body is said to be rust free.</p>
