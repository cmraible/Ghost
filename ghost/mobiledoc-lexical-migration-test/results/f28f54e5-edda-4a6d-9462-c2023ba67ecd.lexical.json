Take this one, for example, a pretty great-looking example from the year 1979. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges and nobody argues against that. However, that's only because it's been sitting quietly for the last 10 years awaiting the day it would receive a full restoration. Finally, that day has come and it was even more spectacular than you might have imagined.",
