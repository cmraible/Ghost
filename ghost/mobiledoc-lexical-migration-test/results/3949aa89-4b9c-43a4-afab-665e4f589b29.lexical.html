<p>We’ve seen all kinds of cars on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-lenos-garage-general-lee/"><em>Jay Leno’s Garage</em></a>, from rare classics to custom fabrications. However, we haven’t seen Bill Burr together with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-leno-1921-mercedes-benz/">Leno</a>. That’s what you get in this latest installment from the TV show. Plus, the two take a ride in a 1965 Buick Riviera GS. There might be too much Bostonian mirth crammed into one car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-leno-viper-enthusiast/">for others to even understand</a>.</p>
<p>Some of you might be wondering why these two comedians are meeting up at a diner and going for a ride in a ’65 Buick Riviera. It seems like a cheap takeoff of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/seinfeld-pumps-the/"><em>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</em></a>, but since that show is not coming back for another season we guess Leno thought it was ok to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jerry-seinfeld-swings-by-jay-lenos-garage/">just continue it</a> on in a half-baked sort of way.</p>

<p>Then there’s the interplay with Leno and Bill Burr. Honestly, we expected more. Burr perhaps is a little too edgy for Jay Leno’s Garage producers, because he seems like a sedated house cat.</p>
<p>Of course, Burr and Leno talk about cars and Burr reveals that moving to California made him more of a car guy. He started researching them more and bought a ’68 Ford F100 he still owns. He disclosed that his dream ride is a 1965 Buick Riviera, a car which all the cool kids had in Boston when he was growing up. That’s when they go for a ride in one.</p>
<p>Sadly, one of the most amazing things about this episode is that nobody’s wearing a mask or socially distancing. Ah, the memories.</p>
<p>The episode starts with Leno driving a McLaren 570S because it fits the theme of “living the dream.” We’re pretty sure Leno does that every day, but it sure is a great commercial for the British automaker and that’s probably why that parts in the beginning.</p>
