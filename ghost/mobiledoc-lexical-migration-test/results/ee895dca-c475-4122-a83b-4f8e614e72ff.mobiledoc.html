<p>In the right hands, this first-generation Vette could go on to do great things!</p>
<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/171603/1962-chevrolet-corvette">1962 Chevrolet Corvette</a> is the last year of the first-generation run of the Corvette. It’s also  evident how much of a precursor the 1962 was for the ultra-popular  Sting Ray body style that would soon follow. Not only that, it was the  last year of the solid-axle <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Corvette">Corvettes</a>,  as they would turn over into a rear-independent suspension layout in  1963 - something the Corvette has become well-known for over the decades  since. This is all a setup to explain why the 1962 Corvette was such a  special car, and why finding one is always a treat for any collector,  but it takes a special kind of collector to see the potential in this  barn find.</p>

<p>This 1962 Corvette barn find up for grabs, is an all original Corvette, that's unrestored that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Charlie's+Classic+Cars">Charlie's Classic Cars</a> found in a barn in Baldwin County, Alabama. The Corvette is original  paint, interior, drivetrain. The car has been sitting in the same spot  since 1984, and they just recently cranked the car, and gotten it to  where it will run and drive now under its own power.</p>
<p>The lady that the car came from actually bought the car with her late  husband in 1964. When the car was parked in 1984, the owner’s husband  would crank the car and drive it around the block once a year to just  keep everything oiled up, until his death about 8 years ago.</p>

<p>The only things missing on the car is the original wheels, but it  still has the original spare tire and wheel, radio, and transmission  shifter. This Vette is a factory 327 cubic-inch engine that was factory  rated as producing 250-horsepower. Backing the V8 engine is a  three-speed manual transmission, so this was made to be a driver’s car.  The car is also an original wonder bar radio car and factory two top  car, meaning it has both a hard top and soft convertible top.</p>
