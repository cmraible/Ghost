<p>Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone in <a href="https://www.maplebrothersauction.com/vehicles/1073/1969-chevrolet-copo-camaro">the 1960s</a>. You show up to the track in your brand new Chevy Camaro SS with a roaring V8 knowing that you could wipe the floor with any other car on the streets. Examples like this 1969 Chevy Camaro COPO are like they have been frozen in history from that time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.maplebrothersauction.com/vehicles/1073/1969-chevrolet-copo-camaro">You pull up</a> to the starting position when you look over only to see what looks like your exact same car. "Our cars are matched, this is all about skill, and I got this!" you say to yourself. Except this is not an ordinary SS or even a ZL1. Instead, this thing is a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro purchased through a program that was for a very long time one of Chevy's best-kept secrets, COPO.</p>
