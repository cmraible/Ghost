<p>Dodge intended to build 100 Vipers to commemorate the event, but <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3852870-2009-Dodge-Viper-SRT10-VOI-10-Edition&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">just 77 were produced</a>.

<p>Like all 2009 Vipers, <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3852870-2009-Dodge-Viper-SRT10-VOI-10-Edition&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this limited edition model</a> is powered by a normally aspirated 8.4 liter V10 rated at 600 horsepower. The rest of the drivetrain consists of a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission and a Dana 44-based rear end that included an electronic limited slip differential.</p>
<p>Zero to 60 sprints take place in under four seconds, while the Viper's top speed is stated to be over 200 miles per hour. Even a decade later, those are <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3852870-2009-Dodge-Viper-SRT10-VOI-10-Edition&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">impressive numbers</a>.</p>
