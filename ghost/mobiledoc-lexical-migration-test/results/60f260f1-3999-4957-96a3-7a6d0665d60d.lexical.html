<h2 id="social-networks-dont-die-theyre-abandoned">Social networks don't die, they're abandoned</h2>
<p>I loved this piece, maybe because the author is of a similar internet vintage to myself. Through the prism of two faded social networks of the past — Livejournal (where <a href="https://adders.livejournal.com">I started blogging</a>) and Tumblr — Gita explores how changes of ownership, leading to changes of policy, can hollow out a network. </p>
<p> It's a reminder that you can never <em>own</em> a community, merely <em>host</em> it. And it can and will move elsewhere if it feels unwelcome. Worth considering, eh, Elon? </p>

<h2 id="when-celebrities-get-radicalised">When celebrities get radicalised</h2>
<p>The story of Russell Brand is a strange one. A decade or so he was a comedian and television presenter, who started getting plaudits for his forays into politics. And slowly, the presenting gigs and the movie appearances started to dry up (aside from voice acting, he didn't trouble the big screen much for half a decade, before he popped up again in Kenneth Branagh's <em>Death on the Nile</em>). And, in the meantime, the politics became ever more extreme as his personal audience grow.</p>
<p>He's beginning to look like another example of audience capture. </p>

<p>Absorbing piece on doing better reporting for and about non-white communities. Much of the advice is applicable beyond the specific communities they're talking about to any marginalised or fringe population: </p>
<blockquote>Journalism can feel <a href="https://www.freepress.net/blog/changing-dynamic-between-residents-and-reporters">extractive</a> in its relationship with sources, according to Free Press. Instead of genuinely listening to sources and responding to their issues, reporters can create more harm by using sources’ trauma to get sound bites and quotes. Derrick Cain, the director of community engagement at <a href="https://resolvephilly.org/">Resolve Philly</a>, aims to mitigate this issue by creating more of a relationship with community members.</blockquote>

<h2 id="ai-scepticism">AI Scepticism</h2>
<p>Personally, I'm pretty bullish on generative AI in the medium term. I suspect there will be a short-term “bust” as too many companies try to foist immature technology on the public, but we'll get there. </p>
<p>But never let it be said there's no room for dissenting voices on <em>my</em> blog. </p>
<p>Noam Chomsky argues in the <em>NYT</em> that the current wave of AI is inherently too limited to ever achieve the hype built up around it:</p>
<blockquote>Here, ChatGPT exhibits something like the banality of evil: plagiarism and apathy and obviation. It summarizes the standard arguments in the literature by a kind of super-autocomplete, refuses to take a stand on anything, pleads not merely ignorance but lack of intelligence and ultimately offers a “just following orders” defense, shifting responsibility to its creators.</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Charlie Stross points out the curious co-incidence that AI has suddenly got hot just the crypto world collapses:</p>
<blockquote>I'm <em>sure</em> it's just a coincidence that training neural networks and mining cryptocurrencies are both applications that benefit from very large arrays of GPUs. As in, hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs soaking up entire nations' worth of electricity.</blockquote>
<p>Unnecessary spoiler: he does not think it's a co-incidence. </p>
