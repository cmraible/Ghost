<p>The simplest recipe to achieve high performance nirvana is to shove big power into a lightweight chassis. Many manufacturers have tried this formula over the years, but perhaps none have been more successful than <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-454634/1986-dodge-shelby-omni-glhs/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Carroll Shelby</a>.</p>

<p>You don't need us to tell you that shoving Ford V8 power into a svelte British sports car created one of the most legendary cars of the 20th century. After parting ways with Ford, Shelby eventually followed his friend Lee Iacocca over to Chrysler <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-454634/1986-dodge-shelby-omni-glhs/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">in the 1980s</a>.</p>
<p>There, Shelby rolled up his sleeves and created some truly impressive, high-tech performance machines. Starting with rather dull front wheel drive four-cylinder cars, Shelby used the magic of turbocharging to build <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-454634/1986-dodge-shelby-omni-glhs/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">some truly potent machinery</a> that gave contemporary Camaro and Mustang owners fits.</p>

<p>Our favorite is the <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-454634/1986-dodge-shelby-omni-glhs/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Dodge Omni GLHS</a>. The lowly Omni hatchback's 2.2 liter four cylinder was treated to a Garrett turbocharger and an intercooler. The result was 175 horsepower, with plenty more on tap depending on how brave you wanted to get with a manual boost controller. The crew at Shelby American cranked these cars up to 12 PSI, but fans and owners will gleefully tell you that there's more on the table.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/epa-fuel-economy-standards/">V8s</a> of the day were making that kind of power, in cars that weighed far more. The Omni GLHS truly lived up to its name: "<a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-454634/1986-dodge-shelby-omni-glhs/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Goes Like Hell S'more</a>." As a more potent follow-up to the Omni GLH, it was an appropriate moniker.</p>

In its lifetime, it's covered just over 8,000 miles, and it looks like it, too.</p>
<p>It will be offered by <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-454634/1986-dodge-shelby-omni-glhs/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Mecum Auctions</a> as part of their Kissimmee 2021 sale in Kissimmee, Florida. That sale runs from January 7 to January 16. With prices for '80s cars on the rise, we expect that this turbocharged hatchback will like up to its name on the auction block, too.</p>
