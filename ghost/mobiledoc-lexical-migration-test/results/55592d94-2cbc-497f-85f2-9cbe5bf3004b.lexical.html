<p>The first-generation Ford Bronco is a breakout collectible that not many saw coming. While it has long earned real estate in the hearts of those who have owned one, making waves in the market as a high dollar vehicle caught many by surprise - but since hindsight <em>is</em> 20/20, is it really all that surprising? Not at all, especially when you take a look over an example that has outlasted the test of time, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/54433/1971-ford-bronco" rel="noopener">like this stunning 1971 Ford Bronco.</a></p>
<p>When the Bronco was imagined, it was designed with the purpose of creating an off-road capable production vehicle. Donald Frey help to roll out the first generation of the early SUV - Frey also played a big role in the introduction of the Ford Mustang. This example represents the middle of the first run of the Bronco, made in between the 1966 to 1977 year models, before the second generation got underway.</p>
<p>To give it off-road control, Ford designed it to have a 92” wheelbase, with a Ford 9” rear end (a serious axle that’s highly coveted by off-roaders and racers, a Dana 44 up front, shift-on the-fly Dana 20 transfer case, and locking hubs.</p>
<p>Modifications done to this particular Bronco help to make it even more capable. Under the hood is a swapped in 302 cubic-inch Ford Small Block engine, which is backed by a five-speed manual transmission with selectable drive modes and gearing ratios. It’s equipped with a detachable hard top that covers the full six-point roll cage and aftermarket bucket seats. The Bronco rides on an upgraded suspension, and Mickey Thompson wheels with Xtreme All Terrain tires make sure the SUV has full utility when driving off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Despite, or in addition to, this Ford having all the trappings of a good off-roader, it’s in pristine show condition. It’s finished in Lamborghini Orange Pearl with gloss black chrome pieces and accents, to ensure this to be an absolute head turner.</p>
