Maybe that’s why the United States Postal Service decided to honor five classic pony cars, giving you and plenty of other people a reason to go splurge at your local post office."

As noted in the press release about the issuance of these new stamps, each model embodies the “youthful spirit” of the automotive world from that time period. That symbolism carries on today, with some current models resurrecting certain styling cues from their predecessors."

          "Back in the 1960s as the horsepower wars ramped up, American automakers realized they could appeal to Baby Boomers by offering small, flashy, affordable, and at least fairly powerful pony cars. These vehicles from Ford, GM, Chrysler, and AMC were a fun alternative to what parents were driving, allowing the upcoming generation to set itself apart in a meaningful way. We don’t have anything which is truly the equivalent of these classics today, a fact we lament often."
