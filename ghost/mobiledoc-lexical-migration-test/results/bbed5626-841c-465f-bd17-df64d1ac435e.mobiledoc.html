<p>In February, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/joe-biden/">President Joe Biden</a> tapped well-connected political advisor Ben LaBolt to be his new communications director. Now, newly released financial disclosure <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/7B4">documents</a> show that LaBolt‚Äôs previous trip through Washington‚Äôs revolving door was incredibly lucrative, and many of his former clients have a stake in pressing matters before the administration, from gig labor and crypto regulations to railroad safety.</p>
<p>LaBolt worked as President Barack Obama‚Äôs deputy press secretary before turning to corporate consulting. The disclosures are a perfect illustration of how profitable this career path can be: LaBolt reported owning assets worth potentially more than $20 million last year.</p>
<p>And while LaBolt <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/biden-limits-communications-chiefs-role-on-crypto-social-media">was reportedly barred</a> from ‚Äúparticipating in legal matters, investigations, or contracts‚Äù relating to some of his former tech and crypto industry clients when he joined the Biden administration, many of his other former clients have obvious interests in White House policy decisions today.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Biden has instituted the strongest ethics rules in history under the Biden-Harris Ethics Pledge,‚Äù White House Assistant Press Secretary Robyn Patterson told <em>The Lever</em>. ‚ÄúBen ‚Äî like every official who serves in this White House ‚Äî is proud to live up to that standard and comply with all appropriate recusals.</p>

<p>LaBolt served as Obama‚Äôs 2008 campaign press secretary and White House deputy press secretary before working on his 2012 reelection campaign. In 2013, LaBolt co-founded a communications firm, the Incite Agency, with former Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs. Their firm was purchased in 2016 by the communications firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.</p>
<p>At the time, Gibbs and LaBolt‚Äôs clients <a href="https://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/clinton-s-digital-shop-buys-agency-run-obama-heavyweights/305869">reportedly included</a> Google, Airbnb, Eli Lilly and Bloomberg Philanthropies. The firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619015552/http://www.theinciteagency.com/">said</a> its approach was ‚Äúgrounded in the strategies we‚Äôve used to define the Obama brand and grow it into a national movement.‚Äù Until February, LaBolt was a partner and board director at Bully Pulpit Interactive.</p>
<p>In his financial disclosures, LaBolt reported a salary and bonus from Bully Pulpit Interactive of $833,000 last year, a $48,000 commission payment. He noted that he sold his stake in Bully Pulpit Interactive and received a $3 million equity payout.</p>
<p>One of LaBolt‚Äôs clients, Andreessen Horowitz, is a major investor in crypto, or digital currencies. He also worked for the crypto exchange Uniswap. The venture capital firm has been one of the most <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/10/17/andreessen-horowitz-crypto-lobbying-washington/?sh=1ec66f8546e7">vocal lobbying spenders</a> trying to shape crypto policy.</p>
<p>LaBolt‚Äôs client list last year included Facebook parent company Meta, as well as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs family office, called West Street LLC, which represents his non-Facebook-related business interests.</p>
<p>The disclosure shows LaBolt worked for the gig economy delivery company InstaCart, a company whose business model is based on classifying low-paid workers as independent contractors ‚Äî a topic the Biden administration has <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ftc-sends-a-warning-to-uber-lyft-doordash-and-other-gig-work-companies-11663279622">suggested</a> could be the subject of a future <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Matter%20No.%20P227600%20Gig%20Policy%20Statement.pdf">enforcement action</a> by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>LaBolt represented Union Pacific, the second largest railroad company in the U.S. Like the rest of the railroad industry, the company has adopted a ‚Äúprecision scheduled railroading‚Äù strategy that‚Äôs meant slashing workforces and running larger trains to juice profits.</p>
<p>He additionally worked for Walton Enterprises, the primary family office of the Walton family, which owns Walmart. The Waltons are one of America‚Äôs <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/3-richest-families-world-live-america">richest families</a> and made their fortune building a low-wage retail giant known for <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/walmart-is-a-monopsonist-that-depresses-earnings-and-employment-beyond-its-own-walls-but-u-s-policymakers-can-do-something-about-it/">depressing workers‚Äô wages</a> and <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2405-real-cost-walmart.html">devastating local economies</a>.</p>
<p>LaBolt‚Äôs firm, Bully Pulpit Interactive, <a href="https://prospect.org/power/top-democratic-consultants-working-for-anti-medicare-for-all/">previously worked</a> for the Partnership for America‚Äôs Health Care Future, a coalition of health insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and hospital chains that spent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/pelosi-gets-hospital-lobbyists-award-after-blocking-reforms/">$80 million</a> opposing Medicare for All and any other major reforms to the health care system. </p>
<p>The group also opposed a ‚Äúpublic option,‚Äù or government health insurance plan, an idea that Biden promised on the 2020 campaign trail and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/where-did-the-public-option-go/">has not mentioned once</a> since becoming president. According to a White House source, LaBolt did not work for the partnership.</p>
