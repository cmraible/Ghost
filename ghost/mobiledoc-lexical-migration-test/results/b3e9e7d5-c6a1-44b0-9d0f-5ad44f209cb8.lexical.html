<p>A lot of people are going stir crazy sitting in their homes at the moment. And while take a drive in your car provides an out, cruising around is much better in a big vintage convertible like this <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/362/1971-pontiac-gto?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 Pontiac GTO</a>. If you’ve never seen one of these before or it’s been a long time there’s good reason: only 678 GTO convertibles were made by Pontiac for the 1971 model year. That makes this rare example very much a collectible, and you have a chance to make it yours through <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Raleigh Classic Car Auctions</a>.</p>

The design was discontinued after that first year of C3 Corvette production, GM not realizing at the time it had created a hot collectible car for later. That design <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/junked-1963-corvette-zo6/">has been so beloved</a> that people have recreated it with modern Corvettes like this one.</p>

<p>We see a lot of classic cars that have either been locked away with no miles or, on the flip side of that coin, have been abused and survive in rough condition. This <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/292/1994-pontiac-trans-am?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1994 Pontiac Trans Am</a> is an example of a collectible car that has been enjoyed over the years but also well cared for. Sure, the odometer is creeping up on 100,000 miles, but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the overall condition of this anniversary edition Trans Am.</p>

<p>Over the course of its three-year lifespan (2004-06), production of the Australian-made Pontiac GTO was capped at just over 40,000 units, so that means just about every build combination is considered rare today. In its final year of production, the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/371/2006-pontiac-gto?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2006 Pontiac GTO</a> was available in seven exterior colors and three interior colors, and just 142 examples were equipped like this one that will be up for grabs through <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Raleigh Classic Auctions</a>.</p>

<p>Bill Thomas had a vision of using Corvette components to build a car which would take down Carroll Shelby’s mighty Cobra. Also born out of the Southern California car culture of the 60s, the Cheetah obviously never rose to the same prominence, but that’s not to say it wasn’t a cool car. Now there’s a <a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/433/1965-cheetah-bill-thomas?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1965 Bill Thomas Cheetah</a> replica, a one-of-a-kind car, which is being offered for sale through <a href="https://crownconceptsusa.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Crown Concepts</a>.

<p>f most people were asked to name off notable Japanese cars from the 1990s, the Dodge Stealth would likely be completely skipped over. That’s in part because so many people see Dodge and assume it’s American, and also that they don’t realize the car was a reskinned Mitsubishi 3000GT. This <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/344/1991-dodge-stealth-rt-twin-turbo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1991 Dodge Stealth RT Turbo</a> is a twin-turbo, all-wheel-drive car from back before that combination was really popular.

<p>When GM released the Z/28 for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hendrick-camaro/">fifth-generation Camaro</a>, they were not fooling around! This car was tuned by Camaro engineers to be the ultimate track car god. With no sixth-generation option yet, and strong skepticism that there will even be a sixth-generation Z/28, this example is extremely rare. With low mileage and a clean appearance, this future collectible 2015 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/abandoned-camaro-z28/">Camaro Z/28</a> is not going to stay on the market for long!</p>
