<p>New York’s now-infamous corporate immunity law for nursing home executives has been placed on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/flooraction/?sh=sked2&calnum=17&calver=">the legislative docket</a> for repeal. The law, slipped into last year’s budget by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, shielded nursing homes from liability as they were <a href="https://skillednursingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/DOH_COVID19__NHAdmissionsReadmissions__032520_1585166684475_0.pdf">forced by the governor</a> to accept patients presumed to have COVID into their facilities.</p>
<p>Last Spring, while the national media was celebrating Cuomo, <em>The Daily Poster </em>helped <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">break open the story</a> of Cuomo passing the law after receiving huge campaign donations from the corporate group pushing it. As <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/"><em>The Daily Poster</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/"> reported</a> earlier this week, the law has shielded administrators and executives from liability for a wide range of negligence claims, even those that don’t appear to be directly related to COVID.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p>• <strong>WESTEXEC INVESTMENT COULD BENEFIT BIDEN OFFICIALS: </strong>The firm Teneo <a href="https://www.axios.com/teneo-westexec-consulting-2b0bebe9-1d44-4e2d-abf6-72dec3e8ca3e.html">has purchased</a> a large stake in WestExec Advisors, the strategic consultancy with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-national-security-revolving-door/">extensive ties</a> to Biden’s administration that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/breaking-potential-biden-officials/">promised investors</a> they would profit from the firm’s government connections. The sale comes just as the Biden officials who own stakes in the firm are divesting from it, meaning they could <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1366602232460832769?s=20">make money </a>from the sale.</p>
<p>• <strong>OIL COMPANY SCORES BAILOUT: </strong>When oil and gas companies, already heavily burdened with debt, file for bankruptcy, taxpayers can be left on the hook for the cost of plugging abandoned wells. These costs could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars depending on the terms of bankruptcies that lawmakers and state attorneys general negotiate, <em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/fossil-fuel-companies-profited-now/">previously reported.</a></em> It’s already beginning to happen: One company in Texas filed for bankruptcy and claimed that it couldn’t afford $10 million worth of well-plugging costs, despite the fact that it <a href="https://twitter.com/climatebrad/status/1367133068381876226?s=20">had given</a> top executives $9 million worth of bonuses the previous year.</p>
<p>• <strong>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SET TO EXPIRE: </strong>On March 14, unemployment benefits will begin to expire for <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1367498349620912140?s=20">millions of Americans</a>, putting pressure on Congress to pass a relief package before then. Some conservative Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1367123203198361600?s=20">reportedly pushed Biden to</a> reduce the weekly unemployment payments from $400 to $300, but the benefit in the Senate’s relief bill introduced today <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1367567273117036546?s=20">will remain</a> at $400 per week and expire on August 29.</p>
<p>• <strong>POLITICAL SPENDING DISCLOSURE BATTLES CONTINUE: </strong>The bad news first: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem <a href="https://twitter.com/Sludge/status/1367487622441021444?s=20">signed</a> a bill last night that would prevent state officials from requiring dark money groups to disclose their donors. The good news: Biden’s Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://twitter.com/CorbinHiar/status/1366431042534584320?s=20">has declined</a> to help multiple companies fight shareholder proposals demanding disclosure of company lobbying activities, in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexCKaufman/status/1366431366267699205?s=20">sharp reversal</a> from the commission’s position during the Trump years.</p>
