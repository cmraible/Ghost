Not only does the thing look about as aggressive as great white shark riding a Harley, it backs that up with some serious performance chops. Still, it’s impressive to see just how much heat one of these can throw out through the exhaust pipes with a few engine revs, something you get to see in a potent way in the video included with this article."

At first he tries having someone hold marshmallows up to the exhaust to light those on fire, but the force of the exhaust gases is so strong they blow off the skewer. Talk about no replacement for displacement."

This works, as the pan moves only a little before the wood ignites, thus proving that in a pinch you can always use your Lamborghini Aventador to start a campfire, if you don’t have a lighter, matches, or flint and steel."

The guy obviously has some cash and if he’s using his wealth to help out others without being compelled, we think that’s great. Whoever he is, we appreciate his showing us what the exhaust of a revving Lamborghini Aventador can do, because these are burning questions most of us can’t just find out the answers to by ourselves."
