          "It’s no secret road fatalities have been on the rise in the past few years. There’s plenty of debate about what’s causing this phenomena, despite all the new safety technology included in cars these days. Well, NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff has decided to focus his regulatory agency’s energy squarely on speeders as the problem. For anyone who has dug into the issue extensively, this truly is a face palm moment."

But to boil the complicated problem down to a single factor is what we’d expect from a former CARB official, which is Cliff’s background. Simplicity of thought is his secret sauce, like super simplicity of thought."

Cliff seeks to paint speed to \"be as undesirable and seen as negatively as other types of bad\" habits when behind the wheel. That’s interesting considering so many view texting and driving as a despicable thing to do, yet obviously there are still plenty of people who do it. It’s almost like the government can’t control such things."
