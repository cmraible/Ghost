<p>When I moved down to Florida I knew no one. Not a single person. And now, since so many people are making the move to Florida, I wanted to put together a list of the best resources for Florida entrepreneurs. </p>
<p><a href="https://sfle.club">Florida Entrepreneurs</a> – This is the community I've been building with my co-founder Nicholas Mohnacky. We currently meet on <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/join/florida-entrepreneur/nL7SowBG">Clubhouse</a> but do plan to start doing in-person meet-ups and events once COVID allows. I've written <a href="__GHOST_URL__/building-the-south-florida-entrepreneur-club/">pretty</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/secret-sauce-building-communities/">extensively</a> about the work we're doing too.</p>
<p><a href="https://weare1909.org">1909</a> – An incredible co-working/accelerator space located in beautiful West Palm Beach. Not only is West Palm Beach a great location, the 1909 office space is beautiful and open. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.bocacode.com">Boca Code</a> – What's being built by Todd Albert, Michelle Bakels, and Jonathan Sanchez at Boca Code is amazing. And the best part is, I get to watch it unfold all right in front of my very eyes as the school is located literally five minutes from where I live. Boca Code is a coding boot camp where they're teaching their students the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce as a developer. They are also taking on development projects as a way to help offset costs for students and also teach them real life development experience. </p>
