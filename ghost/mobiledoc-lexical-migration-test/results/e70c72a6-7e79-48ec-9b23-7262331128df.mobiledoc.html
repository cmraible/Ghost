<p>If you’re reading this, I’ve pulled off a technical challenge I’ve been putting off for years – literally years – now. This blog is now running on WordPress, rather than Movable Type.</p>
<p>It’s not been an easy move – and I’ll outline the process in another post – but it’s now complete, and this site is living on a new host, running new software in the background. And I’m excited to get blogging with the new setup.</p>
<p>Here’s why I moved.</p>
<h2 id="movabletypebiginjapan">Movable Type: big in Japan</h2>
<p>Movable Type, contrary to popular belief, is <em>not</em> dead. It’s alive, well and <a href="https://www.movabletype.com">still being developed by Six Apart</a> – which is now <a href="http://www.sixapart.jp">a Japanese company</a>. However, in the English-language world it’s largely being targeted at the corporate and professional market, with a price tag to match:</p>
<p><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2018/04/movable-type-price.jpg" alt="Movable Type's pricing" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>So, I’m not moving because it’s dead. But I am partially moving because I don’t want to pay more than £300 every couple of years for a new version of the software. The advantages MT offers don’t outweigh the price difference between free and £300.</p>
<h2 id="theneedtoexperiment">The need to experiment</h2>
<p>I’m also moving because my web host was getting more and more grumpy about me running it on their servers, and I came to the conclusion that if I was going to go to the bother of shifting hosts, I might as well shift platforms as well. Because, as alive as MT might be, it’s not well-supported. Try finding themes for it. Or new plugins. Or even other web services that support talking to its API. They’re becoming vanishingly rare.</p>
<p>Increasingly, being tied to MT was stopping me experimenting with new tools, and I don’t like that feeling. Part of the joy of blogging for me has always been in the experimental aspects of it – playing with new pieces of software, and figuring out how they might help me publish better. To keep that feeling, I needed to move on from the comfy familiarity of a blog platform I’d been using for <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2003/07/why_am_i_here.html">over a decade</a>.</p>
<p>Five years ago, much of my working life centered around MT. No more. I have no clients using it, and a whole bunch of them working on WordPress. I really need to understand it much more deeply than I do – which is why my most-used blog needs to be on it. If nothing else, that will force me to explore its quirks and advantages.</p>
<p>And I’m just one of <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2016/02/curbed-kicks-movable-type-kerb.html">many sites making the move</a>.</p>
<h2 id="myghostlyfuture">My Ghost-ly future</h2>
<p>That, incidentally, is why I’m on WordPress rather than the platform I suspect I’ll move to next – <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. Ghost is still very young, and needs some more development before I can switch. But I value this time getting to know WordPress, too.</p>
<p>So, there we are. New <em>One Man & His Blog</em>, living in WordPress and hosted on <a href="http://wpengine.com">WPEngine</a>.</p>
