Some will argue the BMW i8 is a supercar, but its lack of performance begs to differ, even if it is expensive and exotic-looking. Then you have two American muscle cars, which even in the Super Stock and GT500 varieties still shouldn’t be called supercars despite their bloated prices, but we’re guessing to the Brits they are or something? Apparently so is Tesla’s full-size sedan and the Supra?"
