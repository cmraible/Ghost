The bright white paint job is accented by black body stripes, and chrome bed rails, bumpers and wheels provide a perfect finishing touch. The custom interior features leather bucket seats, digital gauges and a thick wood-rimmed steering wheel, but the best part of this truck is, by far, the impressive cargo bed with the wood planks and bright metal strips."
