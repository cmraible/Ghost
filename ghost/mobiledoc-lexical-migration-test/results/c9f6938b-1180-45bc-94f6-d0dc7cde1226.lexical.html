The bike has only 65 miles on it! So, it’s got its whole life ahead of it and is ready for a new rider. It’s one-of-a-kind and extremely rare, so be prepared to bring home a trophy or two at your next event.</p>

<p>For those who may not be familiar with this 2012 Orange County Chopper Biodiesel, it is the world’s first street-legal, high-performance turbo biodiesel motorcycle. It was manufactured by Orange County Choppers with national biodiesel board member CIMA Green and Paul Sr. It’s EPA approved and likely one of the “greenest” motorcycles on the planet–no pun intended, of course. That’s because this bad boy returns more than 100mph to make it perhaps the most economical big bike in the world today.</p>
<p>Biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from agricultural byproducts and co-products like soybean oil, and other fats and oils. The biodiesel industry supports 39,000 American jobs. In purchasing this bike, you'd (in a way) be supporting the cause and future. But aside from all that, it's a really incredible piece of machinery that would make a cool addition to your garage. Register to bid today and stay tuned for the auction in just a few weeks!</p>
