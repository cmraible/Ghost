Then in February the classic muscle car was recovered, only with much of the bodywork and other parts missing. Buried under some bushes with blankets covering the vehicle up, the thieves obviously did an amateur job. Now, the guy who’s accused of masterminding this heist has reportedly skipped town instead of making his court appearance, meaning law enforcement needs your help getting him back into custody."

That’s why we really want to see Nicholas Chamberlain face the music instead of ducking responsibility. Instead of showing up to a court hearing in June, he skipped town and now has a bench warrant out for his arrest."

Police are asking for the public’s help in tracking all three people down so they can have their day in court. If you know anything about where they might be, do the right thing and contact police. Desecrating such a beautiful classic car should have consequences, otherwise it’s just going to happen again."
