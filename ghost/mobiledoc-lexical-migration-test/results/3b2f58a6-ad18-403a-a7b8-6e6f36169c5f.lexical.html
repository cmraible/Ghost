<p>Friends:</p>

<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="__GHOST_URL__/50subscription" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Subscribe For A Year</a></div>
<p>Think about it this way: For less than $5, you get all our podcasts, live events, and other exclusive content, including our <em>Citizens Guide To Holding The Powerful Accountable</em>.<em></em>And your subscription directly funds our reporting that holds politicians accountable.</p>
<p>In the last year, <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been called a “must read” by the <em>Washington Post’s</em> top political reporter, we’ve been called “combative journalists” by <em>The New York Times</em>, and we’ve been touted by <em>The New Yorker</em>’s lead investigative reporter. We’ve been able to cover stories corporate media avoids and make a big impact precisely <em>because</em> we are a reader-supported news outlet.</p>
<p>That’s why we are offering this limited-time discount, because we need more journalists to do even more accountability reporting in 2022.</p>
<p>So please — <a href="__GHOST_URL__/50subscription"><strong>click here right now</strong></a> to use this huge limited-time discount and join our team.</p>
