And the best way to keep track of your conversations and make sure you don’t miss a word is to record your call—and that’s the specialty of <strong>Evaer</strong> for Windows. This app is free to try and only $19.95 for a license, and it’s worth every penny.</p>
<p>Evaer takes the guesswork and technical know-how out of recording your Skype conversations, and it starts up as soon as you log into Skype. The application provides lots of options in terms of sound and video quality, as well as options to choose which sides of the conversation you want to record. Audio is saved as an MP3, while video can be saved as either an MP4 or an AVI file, giving you the option to choose whichever format best suits your needs.</p>
<p>But the best argument for adding Evaer to your Skype conversations? Simply put, it works. Other recording applications can be complicated or riddled with bugs, leaving you with an unlistenable mess afterwards. Evaer, however, seems solid as a rock—at least in all our experiences with the software to date.</p>
