<h2 id="social-medias-difficult-teenage-years">Social Media's difficult teenage years</h2>
<p>Social media has long been the glamorous part of audience engagement work (from the outside, at least), compared to the technical detail of SEO, and the slow, steady work of building newsletters. Indeed, up until a couple of years ago, social media and audience engagement were largely synonymous. Thankfully, that is changing quickly. </p>
<p>Reducing your dependence on social as an acquisition channel feels vital now, as the social media waters feel more choppy than I can ever recall them being in the 20-odd years I've been tracking this stuff. </p>
<p>On the one hand, you have Facebook looking ever-so-slightly desperate in its moves to maintain and protect its position. Instagram seems to be the main "beneficiary" of its efforts, with some fundamental changes, from the advent of TikTok clone Reels, and also a shift in the algorithm, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/08/19/instagram-reaches-for-more-of-tiktoks-magic-with-a-change-to-its-main-feed/">to give you more “discovery” content</a>. A simplistic reading of that change would be that Instagram is, in effect, merging your feed and the discover tab to make room for Reels…</p>
<p>The move has not been well-received in some quarters, as this thread makes clear:</p>

<p>As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/09/07/irace-instagram">put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>There’s an apt slogan for the service Instagram <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/18/nguyen-reels-tiktok">has devolved into</a> under Facebook’s steady hand: “Photos of your friends and loved ones, replaced with nonsense. Welcome to Instagram.”</blockquote>

<p>On the other had there's, well, <em>everything</em> about TikTok. </p>
<p>The journey of the last 15 years has been fascinating. When I was running around in 2007 exhorting the likely value of Twitter, it would be fair to say I was met with skepticism. In 2020, we have governments literally fighting over control of social media technology. </p>
<p>For example, China has thrown a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8480c0d-7cce-4f10-88ec-6b8294e71ec4">massive spanner in the works of the sale of TikTok</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Last week Chinese regulators cast doubt over ByteDance’s planned sale of the US operations of its short-video subsidiary TikTok, by expanding the country’s list of controlled exports to include the algorithms that power the viral video app.</blockquote>
<p>Why the algorithm rather than the data? Simple. It's the algorithm that controls what people see. What people see influences what people think. And China is really active in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/11/isabel-hilton-cameron-lecture-china-journalism/">controlling its image globally</a>. </p>
<p>It's increasingly clear that while the general public perceive social media as a way of keeping up with friends, family and celebs, and publishers see it as a promotional tool. However, governments and other politically active bodies see it as a way to control how people perceive the world. </p>
<p>For too long journalism has let itself been led about by the nose, pandering to the whims of the social media platforms for a taste of that sweet, sweet traffic we all crave. That can't continue. </p>
<p>But walking the fine line of taking advantage of what social media offers us without being consumer and subsumed by it is critical. And really, really hard.</p>
<p>By all means build relationships on social media. But, whatever you do, find ways of moving the most valuable of those readers into a direct relationship, unmediated by social media. Up the passion pathway they go, be it via newsletters, podcasts or any other way you can talk to you readers, without the invisible hand of the algorithm controlling the conversation. </p>

<p>One of the the delights of being married to a woman with a PhD in immunology is hearing, in great detail, how bad most of the reporting is about the pandemic. But there are worse things than shoddy science journalism. Here's a good explanation of how conspiracy theorists ape the language of science to spread their ideas. </p>
<p>Sometimes, knowledge of tactics is a useful vaccine against becoming a carrier of misinformation. </p>

<h2 id="evolution-not-extinction">Evolution, not extinction</h2>
<p>The theme of much of what I've been writing here for the past 17(!) years has been about media <em>evolution</em> rather than decline. Even the name of the site is playing with the idea that one person can become a media businesses thanks to the internet (as well as being <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006pn5q">a terrible play on words</a>, of course). </p>
<p>And so, it feels entirely appropriate to leave you with this message of hope, found <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/MediaVoices">via my friends at Media Voices</a>: </p>
