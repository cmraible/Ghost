<p>Classic car theft has become <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-dead-mans-classic-cars/">far too common these days</a>, leaving many owners feeling distraught upon finding their <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-steals-classic-cars/">beloved vehicles have been stolen</a>. However, law enforcement is fighting back with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-using-wildlife-cameras/">modern technology</a>, like how the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office in Oklahoma used a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-graveyard-lake-michigan/">drone</a> to confirm several stolen classic cars were hidden on a property. This is a superb way to bring car thieves to justice, so they hopefully get exactly what they deserve.</p>
<blockquote><em>See why stealing classic cars is so easy <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stealing-classic-cars-easy/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The investigation started when the Pawnee County Sheriff’s Office had “developed” information about several classic cars which were stolen from that county being located on a property in Tulsa County. That’s when deputies got to work, deploying a drone to check out the suspect’s house and the land around it from the air. Using that drone, they could see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cops-bust-tennessee-chop-shop/">several vehicles</a> covered with tarps.</p>

<p>While it wasn’t clear if the cars under the tarps were stolen or not, as the drone was performing the surveillance, 50-year-old Steven Kitchens fired a gun at it. There’s nothing quite like acting suspicious when law enforcement is checking you out.</p>

<p>Kitchens was present at the home when deputies returned and served the warrant. They arrested him and he’s facing charges for reckless handling of a firearm plus being a felon in possession of a firearm. 43-year-old Alan Vanderwagen took off before deputies showed up, but Muskogee County Deputies tracked him down at a relative’s house. He’s facing charges for possession of a stolen vehicle, knowingly concealing stolen property, possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, plus the man has an outstanding warrant for eluding and endangering others, so he has a history of running from cops.</p>
<p>It’s great to see car thieves get collared like this, and we hope they get the justice they so richly deserve.</p>
