<hr>
<p>Well that didn't take long. Not only is this gorgeous C8 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-heroes-36-corvettes/">Corvette</a> believed to be the first customer-purchased car to get wrecked (just a day after it was purchased!), but soon it could very well become the first mid-engine <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/award-winning-corvette/">Corvette</a> to get an engine swap. And it's definitely not the swap most people saw coming.</p>

<p>This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/today-last-day-enter-win-corvettes/">Corvette</a> had just 200 miles on it when it was t-boned a Hyundai that was driven by a suspected drunk driver who had carelessly pulled out in front of this car, and it was serious enough of a collision to deploy airbags and cause heavy front end damage. About a month later, YouTuber Rob Dahm bought the wrecked Corvette and its accompanying pile of parts. </p>
<p>While he plans on starting the project by rebuilding the Corvette, Dahm's plans are ultimately to pull out the C8's dry-sump 6.2-liter LT2 V8 and replace it with a four-rotor engine and all-wheel drive. On his way back from Florida, he stopped at the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-pace-car-history/">National Corvette Museum</a> as part of his "apology tour" for his unconventional engine swap. It will be interesting to watch this wrecked Corvette get put back together before being ripped right back apart.</p>

<p>Only about 2,700 C8 Corvettes were produced before the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-covid-19-is-affecting-collector-car-auctions/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>caused the Bowling Green plant shutdown, so these first-year C8s are definitely going to be rare. Examples of the all-new 2020 Chevrolet Corvette have already starting to his the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/loaded-2020-chevrolet-corvette-3lt-z51/">resale market</a>, and they are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2020-corvette-z51/">selling extremely fast</a>.</p>
