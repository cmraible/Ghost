          " created by Chevrolet to skirt GM regulations against performance cars and racing. This option was explicitly made for racers who wanted to show off exactly what their car was capable of despite growing concerns from the parent company, who wanted their brands to stop making racing cars. But, of course, telling a speed-hungry American not to do something is a sure-fire way to get them to do it anyways, which is precisely why we love this secretive program so much. However, in the 1960s, few people knew about the program, which meant that few cars were made with these options. This vehicle pays tribute to the legacy of the COPO program with its performance and build quality, and now you may have the chance to get behind the wheel."

          ", it's got all of the goodies you might expect from what was essentially a factory race car in its time. Under the hood, you'll see a massive 427 cubic inch V8 engine which came in the COPO models in the 1960s. It was tough to get your hands on something this fast back in the day, though companies would eventually loosen up a bit and provide better performance than in previous generations. Another pretty cool feature of this car is the four-speed automatic transmission which would have been perfect for drag racing at the time. Even back then, a good automatic transmission was a great choice for any racing or spirited daily driver looking for some fun on the track. "
