Once you get inside and turn that ignition key, you immediately understand why this wasn’t your average Camaro but instead was almost like a spaceship for the mid-80s. It has a part digital dash, control pods for things like the turn signals and headlights, and a futuristic radio face which swivels side to side. Oh, and those control pods slide in and out, so you can position them how you like. On the roof are more controls made to be like what you find in aircrafts, plus a map light just like what you probably used on your last nighttime flight. The interior controls were very advanced for 1984."

Then he launches into complaints about another company offering to help with his site, which if you look at really does need some serious help. It just adds to the overall entertainment factor of the video, although we’re not sure if buying a car from him might push someone over the edge or not."
