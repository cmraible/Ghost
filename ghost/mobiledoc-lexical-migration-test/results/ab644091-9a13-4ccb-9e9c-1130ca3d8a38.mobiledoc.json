That number jumps to three as the Texas-based tuner introduces the Hennessey Venom 775. Adding to its list of trucks that include the VelociRaptor, Maximus and Goliath, Hennessey's Venom 775 delivers sinister styling and insane performance."

The power increase is achieved through a 2.9-liter supercharger, but the engine has also received improved cooling and fuel delivery. These upgrades definitely paid off with this big 4x4 Crew Cab able to accelerate from 0-60 in just four seconds to go along with a quarter-mile time of 12.1 seconds."

To finish things off, Hennessey gave the Venom 775 an imposing presence with a six-inch lift and 20-inch wheels wrapped in 35-inch tires, and this truck also adds unique front bumper with integrated LEDs and distinctive Hennessey graphics. Options include the $5,950 ram air hood, $4,950 custom interior, $2,950 power-folding side steps and $2,450 custom rear bumper."
