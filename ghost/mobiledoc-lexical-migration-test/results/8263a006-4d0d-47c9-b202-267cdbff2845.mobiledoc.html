<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This weekend, something big happened: <em>The Daily Poster</em> was on CNN explicitly calling out corporate media’s corruption. The moment illustrated just how much of an impact our accountability journalism is making —  and why we need our free subscribers to <a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/048cc06618f4fb43ee0">use this special discount RIGHT NOW</a> to help us expand our work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/10/31/david-sirota-critiques-coverage-of-dc-budget-battles.cnn">Watch the CNN clip here</a> — you’ll see me using an appearance on CNN to show how corporate media has been refusing to mention that Big Oil and Big Pharma are bankrolling the lawmakers trying to kill climate and drug pricing legislation. The appearance followed our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-spin/">reporting</a> on how corporate media has been helping its industry sponsors try to kill legislation on Capitol Hill.</p>

And as one top legislator <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1444001859480469519">recently noted</a>, our work is having a major impact.</p>
