If that’s not compelling enough to make this supercar a highly sought-after collectible, the fact it was gifted by Honda to AMA Superbike Champion Miguel Duhamel when the rider snagged the number one spot in the AMA Superbike and 600 Supersport races for the Daytona 200, despite the fact he had a broken leg. That’s an amazing story to go with this vehicle."
