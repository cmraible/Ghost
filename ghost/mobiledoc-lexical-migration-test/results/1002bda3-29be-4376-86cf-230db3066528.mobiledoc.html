<p>Some are wondering if the astronomical selling price this Supra fetched on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/cascio-motors-is-selling-a-50th-anniversary-cobra-at-no-reserve-on-bring-a-trailer/">Bring A Trailer</a> was due to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/used-car-pricing-insanity-update/">crazy-high used car prices</a> we’ve seen lately. While that might seem like a possibility, we haven’t seen much evidence of the price inflation affecting higher-end collectables. But markets are complex since they’re driven by human behavior, which is also complex.</p>

<p>What definitely had an impact on this car’s top bid was the fact this MK4 Supra was still in the possession of its original owner, who only racked up 7,000 miles on the odometer. How this person exercised that kind of self-discipline is a mystery. It’s sat in a clean garage and obviously has been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/toyota-supra-parts-program/">impeccably maintained</a>, with the Renaissance Red exterior and ivory leather interior looking absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p>As people have been pointing out, back in January of 2019, another MK4 Supra with just 7,000 miles on the clock sold on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/cruise-the-coast-in-style-in-this-1964-corvette-convertible-on-bring-a-trailer-2/">Bring A Trailer</a> for $121,000. Does this mean the market is skyrocketing, or was this last sale a fluke? We’ll have to see what happens with other MK4s as they cross virtual or physical auction blocks in the near future before declaring a verdict either way.</p>
<p>About the only drawback to this ’95 Supra is the fact the Michelin Pilot SX tires are old. That didn’t hold back the wave of bids, which eventually drove the price up to a level we might be marveling at for some time.</p>
