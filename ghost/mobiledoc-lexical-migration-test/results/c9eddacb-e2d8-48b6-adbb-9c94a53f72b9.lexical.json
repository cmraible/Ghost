The 38 year-old man reportedly used a front loader to break into a facility and trash about 50 Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles, causing considerable damages we’re sure will total a large sum. It all went down at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vitoria, which is in the middle of Basque Country in the northwestern portion of the country.",
