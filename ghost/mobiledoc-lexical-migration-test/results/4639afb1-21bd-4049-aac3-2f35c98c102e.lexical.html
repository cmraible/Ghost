<h3 id="crypto%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cuseful-stooge%E2%80%9D">Crypto’s “Useful Stooge”</h3>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/julia-rock/">Julia Rock</a></p>
<p>Within days, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/10/crypto-megadonor-sam-bankman-fried-00066062">Democratic megadonor’s</a> cryptocurrency empire came crashing down. Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange platform FTX, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/ftxs-ftt-token-plunges-80percent-wiping-out-over-2-billion-in-value.html">once valued</a> at $32 billion, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/crypto-giant-ftx-file-bankruptcy-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-steps-rcna56749">filed for</a> bankruptcy. Customer funds <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/exclusive-least-1-billion-client-funds-missing-failed-crypto-firm-ftx-sources-2022-11-12/">vanished</a> from the exchange overnight, and all deposits <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/put-money-ftx-now-money-frozen-maybe-wiped-rcna57251">have been frozen</a> indefinitely.</p>
<p>Reports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/13/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-quietly-used-ftx-customer-funds-without-raising-alarm-bells-say-sources.html">suggest</a> that Bankman-Fried was using consumer deposits from FTX to make risky bets through his separate crypto research and trading firm, Alameda Research, and using digital tokens issued by FTX as leverage, despite them having <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-14/ftx-s-balance-sheet-was-bad">little real value</a>.</p>
<p>The unfolding story of Bankman-Fried and FTX is one of alleged fraud on the scale of Bernie Madoff’s notorious Ponzi scheme — a comparison being made by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/binance-executive-compares-sam-bankman-fried-to-holmes-and-madoff.html">crypto executives</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/business/ftx-madoff-bankman-fried-bair/index.html">former regulators</a> alike.</p>
<p>But like Madoff’s scheme, the problem is far bigger than one person.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>The rest of the crypto industry and the people who helped launder Bankman-Fried’s image would like you to believe the problems with cryptocurrency are confined to one man — or perhaps one man and his polycule. But as <em>The Lever</em> has been carefully detailing, Bankman-Fried is not where the scandal and potential criminal behavior ends.</p>
<p>“[Bankman-Fried] is part of this whole gross network of people,” Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, explained on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tales-from-the-crypto/">this week’s episode of <em>Lever Time</em></a>. “Basically, anybody who ever pushed crypto is part of this network of Silicon Valley goons and they really want to focus on [Bankman-Fried], not just because he was an important player, but because he’s a useful stooge.”</p>
<p>Stoller added, “It’s easier to go after him than to go after Harvard, than to go after, Andreesen Horowitz, or Sequoia, or Brookings, or you know, the Federal Reserve, or any number of institutions that would not say, this is fake nonsense, this is ridiculous, and it shouldn’t exist.”</p>
<p>That <a href="__GHOST_URL__/washingtons-32-billion-crypto-scam/">network also includes</a> former President Bill Clinton, Sean McElwee of the polling outfit Data for Progress, Sen. Kyrsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and other Washington power players, as <em>The Lever</em> reported last week.</p>
<p>Clinton appeared at an event with Bankman-Fried, then reportedly said that regulators should adopt a “do no harm” approach to crypto regulation. Gillibrand has pushed legislation to lessen regulatory oversight of crypto. And Democratic Party operatives worked for Bankman-Fried on his efforts to help elect crypto-friendly politicians.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s downfall might be exceptional, but don’t be fooled by the people who would like you to believe he’s the only one who should be scrutinized in the wake of the FTX scandal.</p>
