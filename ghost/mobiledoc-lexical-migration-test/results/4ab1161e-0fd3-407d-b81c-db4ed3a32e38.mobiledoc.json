The charges and bond amount could increase now that a third death has been confirmed."

It seems like nowadays, people can't resist showing off in the stupidest ways, and this is coming from a huge showoff behind the wheel. So here we are, reporting on, yet another, modern muscle car making everyone else look like irresponsible delinquents who can't handle their own car. As a result, two have died from a Chevy Camaro crash in Harris county, Texas."

A Camaro is seen racing down an access road/off-ramp, and violently smacking into a Malibu, that was pulling out into the road. The Malibu was hit so hard that debris damaged a second Camaro in a nearby parking lot. "

          "Reports are conflicting about what happened to the passenger, with a reliable source saying the passenger is seen thrown from the Camaro in the video. A local news station notes that two bystanders, at least one hit by the Malibu, have now died, with another airlifted from the scene, one being a 16-year-old boy. While a different Houston news site allude to the passenger of the Camaro being the other person who died. Comments on his Facebook page (which we won't link to for obvious reasons) mention that a third teen has also died in the last few hours. Meanwhile, the grown man, who appears to actually be a father, who was (poorly) driving the Camaro is a-okay - he has been charged with manslaughter and aggravated assault."

Surely in his multiple decades on this planet, he's heard of drag strips, road courses, and at least private property to flex on, but I guess that would be less thrilling without the squealing teens cheering him on."

Here's to hoping this is a wake up call to someone tempted to engage in these spectator filled drive bys. On a long enough timeline, you're going to hurt someone or destroy your car, that's not something a real auto enthusiast would even risk. "
