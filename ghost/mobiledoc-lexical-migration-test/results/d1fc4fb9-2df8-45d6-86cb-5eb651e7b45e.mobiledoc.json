For protection, the entire vehicle was coated in a custom Avocado Mist Body Armor Coating. The color, though not usually available in Body Armor, was a factory option in 1978. The frame was also blasted and an epoxy undercoat has been applied. All of the hinges, latches, and hardware has been replaced with high-quality 316 stainless steel."
