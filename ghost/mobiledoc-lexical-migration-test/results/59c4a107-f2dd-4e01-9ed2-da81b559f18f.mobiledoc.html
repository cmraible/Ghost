<p>Back in the mid-1960s as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminal-fleeing-wrecks-mustangs/">Ford</a> was riding high on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">success of the Mustang</a>, there was serious consideration within the halls of the Blue Oval to make a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/artist-makes-camaro-zl1-wagon/">wagon</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/baywatch-dodge-challenger/">shooting brake</a> version of the pony car. That might sound ridiculous now, however we have an all-electric SUV wearing the Mustang badge and name, so think about that for a moment. Back in the 60s station wagons were popular and Ford was searching for ways to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-mustang-sedan-is-coming/">broaden the Mustang’s appeal</a> so it could get more of that sweet, sweet consumer cash.</p>

<p>There were several different Ford Mustang station wagon concepts considered in the 60s. One was turned into a running prototype using a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/flared-1966-mustang-fastback/">1966 Mustang</a> coupe and it’s the one featured in the photos. AS you can see, it doesn’t look half bad and unlike the Mach E it preserves the overall look of the Mustang.</p>
<p>Another prototype, which we unfortunately don’t have photos of, apparently incorporated some of the upcoming model updates Ford had planned out through the end of the 60s.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Ford says none of the Mustang wagon concepts had more than three doors. Even back then, designers realized a four-door pony car was ridiculous, even if it were a wagon. Adding more doors takes away from the sportiness of the Mustang, making it a horse of an entirely different color. That wisdom has been lost today, because it looks like we’re getting a Ford Mustang sedan soon.</p>
<p>Captivated by what might have been, many enthusiasts have taken it upon themselves to build Ford Mustang wagons. There are also aftermarket kits for converting a classic Mustang into a wagon. They all vary in their approach, including one that’s a Shelby GT350, but they demonstrate perhaps Ford should’ve taken the plunge at least made a limited run of the things.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/grjbWL3LVNs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
