Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California, often referred to as VMC, was the sort of place where violent assault at the hands of patients was a near-daily occurrence. Kamara, a nine-year ER nurse at the facility, had watched the 300-employee department chew up and spit out plenty of lackadaisical suburban doctors, and when he worked his first shift with Chien in 2016, he did not have high hopes. Twelve hours later, he was a believer."

On January 14, US Acute Care Solutions, the private equity-backed physician staffing monolith that had taken over the hospital’s ER contract last June, sacked everyone’s favorite boss — with a cruel twist. The Ohio-based contract management group, which emergency doctors refer to by the acronym USACS, fired Chien as medical director, but kept him on the schedule as a doctor. So Chien continued to show up to work because, as someone who had basically been fired for no apparent reason, he seemed scared not to."
