<p>Every once in a while you run across a car so compelling, well-presented, and with an amazing background that it would make an invaluable addition to your collection. That’s what makes this <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0020-1971-jensen-intercepter-ii-saloon/820684?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 Jensen Intercepter II Saloon</a> so exciting, especially since it will be auctioned at no reserve by <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">RM Sotheby’s</a>.</p>
<p>This Jensen Intercepter II Saloon certainly looks impressive, especially after it went through a restoration process, which apparently was light and only addressed some cosmetic areas. In other words, this classic vehicle has been meticulously maintained throughout its life and is ready to be fully enjoyed by its next owner. A binder with extensive documentation including service records, magazines, and brochures is being included with the sale.</p>
<p>With an Estoril Blue over red leather scheme, this Jensen is striking to behold. That color combination flaunts the curves nicely, while a Chrysler 383ci V8 and TorqueFlite automatic transmission make it a joy to drive on the open road. Many luxurious features have been included from the factory, like air conditioning, power windows, and more.</p>
<p>Even better, this Jensen hails from the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Elkhart Collection</a>, an amazing array of over 240 cars in impeccable condition. All those vehicles were carefully accumulated over decades and represent a highly scrutinized selection process. Some of the most well-respected British and Italian car brands are represented in the Elkhart Collection, with a nice array of sports cars, luxury models, microcars, classics, supercars, coachbuilt vehicles, and more. Most lots in the collection are going to the auction block with no reserve. That impressive collection heads to the auction block October 23 and 24.</p>
<p>Also included in the collection are numerous automotive collectibles.</p>
