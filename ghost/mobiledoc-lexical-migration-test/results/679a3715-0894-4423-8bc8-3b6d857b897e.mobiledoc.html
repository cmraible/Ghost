<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It is Saturday morning, a brief moment of quiet in a noisy world of information overload. Righteous protests fill our streets, rage fills our social media feeds and propaganda blasts at us from our televisions — all while we try to take care of the kids, make ends meet and somehow remain sane.</p>
<p>I just wanted to take this brief moment of quiet here at my kitchen table to say thank you — thank you for reading, thank you for sharing our work with your friends, and thank you for all the input and feedback. And if you haven’t already, I hope you will consider going to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> to become a supporting subscriber — because we are aiming to expand.</p>
<p>In the first two months of this project, we have had some big successes — including this week, in our reporting on how corruption and greed has worsened the pandemic emergency.</p>
<p><strong>As the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-pennsylvania-gop-scandal-hidden-data-pandemic/">American Prospect</a> wrote yesterday, the journalism work we do “dares to go into hidden corners to expose deceit, for which we should all be grateful.”</strong></p>
<p>None of this would be possible without your support. Indeed, because many of you have been willing to pitch in — whether as an annual subscriber or a monthly subscriber — we have been able to build out what we are doing. We’ve brought on investigative reporter Andrew Perez and we’ve forged a partnership with Jacobin magazine. We have subscriber-only content (you’ll get the weekly must-reads tomorrow morning, as always!). And we have other plans to expand in the works.</p>
<p>The point is simple: whether you are a supporting subscriber or just helping spread the word about our work, your support is making a real difference.</p>
<p>We know the old model of journalism is dying — and we know that corporate- and billionaire-funded media will never consistently scrutinize corporations and billionaires. Your willingness to support this project is helping us do our part to build a different kind of model — grassroots-funded journalism that challenges power.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being part of this effort — in these dark and crazy times, we all must try to do our part to build a better future. That’s what we are trying to do here.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
