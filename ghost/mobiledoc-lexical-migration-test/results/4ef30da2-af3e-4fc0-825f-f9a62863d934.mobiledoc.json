The way OIS works on iPhones is it uses a gyroscope to measure movement of the device while you’re taking a photo. The lens moves accordingly, cutting down on or sometimes eliminating any blurring. This is especially a factor when you’re taking a photo while holding your iPhone with just one hand."

          "The other vulnerable system is closed-loop autofocus. That technology helps the camera maintain a sharp focus on the subject of your photos and videos despite vibrations and the effects of gravity. To do that, on-board magnetic sensors measure both gravity and vibration, determining what position the lens should be in so compensating motion will be set accurately. The end result is fewer photos and videos which are out of focus, even if you’re not manipulating any of the camera settings on your iPhone."

I’m not sure if Android phones would have problems under the same situations, but it might be possible. Also, Apple says the sensors are only damaged over “long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations” as they “degrade the performance of theses systems.” That means a gradual reduction in photo and video quality, so it’s not something which happens overnight."

It’s recommending using a vibration dampening mount on those vehicles, but apparently that’s not enough to protect your device when mounted to a motorcycle with a high-powered or high-volume engine. Some even claim their iPhone has been damaged after they’ve mounted it to the handlebars of their bicycle."
