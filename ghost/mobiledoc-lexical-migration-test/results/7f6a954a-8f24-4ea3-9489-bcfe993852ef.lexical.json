As described, it’s both a place to blog yourself and to gather stories from the paper. A workspace? A social network? A bit of both? From the looks of the pics on Flickr it resembles a blog-centric social network, like [Vox](http://www.vox.com). But Shane’s not giving too many details.\n\nIt certainly has the makings of a significant expansion of a major national newspaper into the user-generated content field, although the legal ramifications of all this blogging under the Telegraph’s name must have given them pause for thought.\n\nBut, worries aside, it could also be the idea that triggers mainstream adoption of blogging by the British public. And that’s pretty damn exciting.\n\n\n"
