And other than the darkly tinted windows (including the windshield and engine cover), this C8 is 100 percent bone stock. Since there's nothing better than a little red Corvette, this C8 is painted in Torch Red with black wheels and lots of carbon fiber trim."

Starting with the C8's fully loaded 3LT trim level, this Corvette also adds the optional Z51 Performance Package that adds performance suspension, performance brakes, performance rear end gears and an electronic limited-slip differential. The 490-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 is mounted behind the front seats, and it is bolted to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. With the Z51 Performance Package, the Corvette is able to accelerate from 0-60 mph time of under three seconds, which is the highest performance you can get from a C8 at this time."
