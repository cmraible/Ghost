We attribute these free vacations handed out by automakers to journalists for why so many just freely shill for companies blindly, almost like they’re not actually being critical of products like they should be. Then there are instances like this dyno run for the Rivian R1T done by a Youtuber, which doesn’t go as planned, and it's refreshing to see something that isn't heavily scripted."

This isn’t one of those dyno run videos where the engine explodes (there isn’t one and the electric motors aren’t under compression anyway) or where the vehicle suddenly catches on fire. Instead, the end result of this dyno run is super underwhelming."

That’s disappointing considering Rivian says these trucks can produce over 600-hp and 600 lb.-ft. of torque. Put does that mean they’re lying? Well, it’s a bit more complicated than that."

As Aaron O’Neal pointed out, there’s no dyno mode, so the safety systems are just going nuts as the wheels are spinning fast and objects are detected all around the thing. In other words, he couldn’t get a clear read on what kind of power the Rivian R1T actually makes, so it’s likely way more than 526-hp and 563 lb.-ft. of torque. Hopefully Rivian provides an update with a dyno mode, then a proper test can be done. Until then, we’re just left to guess."
