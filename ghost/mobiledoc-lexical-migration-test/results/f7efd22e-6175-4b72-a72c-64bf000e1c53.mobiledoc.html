<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We have some exciting news — as part of our expansion plan, we have changed our name and launched our new upgraded publication: <em>THE DAILY POSTER</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This project is 100 percent grassroots funded — so if you like the accountability journalism we’ve been doing, please help us hire more reporters by subscribing at <a href="#/portal/signup">dailyposter.com/subscribe</a>. You’ll get all of our new subscriber-only content.</strong></p>
<p>You can find all of our archives at our new dedicated URL: <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com">dailyposter.com</a></p>
<p>You can follow our new Twitter feed at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/dailyposter">@dailyposter</a></p>
<p>Over the last 6 months, our grassroots-funded journalism project has grown from a small one-person newsletter into its own media outlet that produces big stories and scoops on everything from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-trump-donors-firm-got-big-postal">Trump corruption</a> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity">pandemic profiteering</a> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-war-against-the-climate-movement">climate policy</a> to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-backtracks-after-tmi-report">2020 election</a>. Our accountability journalism has busted open big stories that have prompted New York to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-limit-cuomos-corporate-immunity">backtrack</a> on its corporate immunity law, Joe Biden to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-backtracks-after-tmi-report">back off</a> using GOP talking points, and congressional Democrats to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trumps-usps-chair-grilled-after-tmi">grill</a> Trump’s postal service appointee.</p>
<p>To build off these successes and accelerate our expansion plan, we decided on our new name because it summarizes our ethos.</p>
<p>Our new name is not a publishing schedule — it is a way of life and a code. In the age of the Internet, we are all daily posters — we post, we comment, we retweet, we email, we text, and sometimes we even reply all. We all live on the Internet, and when we have something to say, we post it online.</p>
<p>The quintessential poster is one who rejects bullshit and tells the truth, whether people like it or not. That is our commitment to you — and we couldn’t do it without our supporting subscribers. Thanks to them pitching in, we have been able to bring aboard journalists Andrew Perez, Julia Rock, Walker Bragman and Matthew Cunningham-Cook.</p>
<p><strong>We are now working hard to expand even further and hire more reporters, which means we need as many free subscribers to become supporting subscribers at $5 a month or $50 a year. So here’s my ask:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> and become a supporting subscriber? When you become a supporting subscriber, you get access to all of our subscriber-only content.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request — and please send us any feedback you may have about our new upgrade. We are excited to launch this new phase of our journalism project — and hope to have you as a supporting subscriber.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. If you want to still receive the limited free version of this newsletter, you don’t have to change anything. You’re still on the list.</p>
