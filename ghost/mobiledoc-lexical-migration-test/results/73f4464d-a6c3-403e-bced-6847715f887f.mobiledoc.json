          "The whole point of the Porsche 928 was that it provided a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout in a lightweight package. That’s why the German automaker used aluminum for the hood, doors, and other body panels. It was also designed for aerodynamics, hence the rounded shape of the headlights, rear fascia, etc. With a water-cooled V8, these cars are a blast to drive on the open road or even on surface streets."

Plus, only 3,800 928s for the 1980 model year wore this color, so it’s not exactly common. With a deep shine showing in the pictures, the owner seems to have understood how special this car and its paint are. The listing says it was always a garage-kept vehicle and its appearance testifies of that."

That means the interior isn’t worn out even though it’s all original. In fact, you can see the switchgear looks not too far off from how it did back in 1980. We really don’t like how the term “time capsule” is applied too often to cars, but this one seems to qualify, which is really impressive."
