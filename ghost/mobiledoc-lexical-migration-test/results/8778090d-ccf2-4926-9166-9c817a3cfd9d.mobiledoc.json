For this car, a Sean Hyland Motorsports 2.3-liter supercharger has been added for about 10 psi of boost. The powerplant is tuned for 620-horsepower and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, more than enough to provide a good time. As you can imagine, a good number of the internal components have been swapped in favor of aftermarket options. Also, there’s a TKO600 5-speed manual transmission to help the driver get the thrill of a 3-pedal experience."
