<h3 id="dom-and-his-crew-are-back-for-the-ninth-fast-furious-feature-film">Dom and his crew are back for the ninth Fast & Furious feature film.</h3>
<p>The first official trailer for <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em> went live last week during a massive concert/party in Miami. This ninth installment in the <em>Fast & Furious</em> movie franchise will hit theaters on May 22, 2020 with new twists, insane stunts and plenty of cool cars.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Vin Diesel's character, Dominic Toretto, is once again behind the wheel of a Mopar shown by this 1970 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Dodge/Charger">Dodge Charger</a> 500. A short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEkmI7e36PE" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a> shows Dom wrenching on a vintage Massey Ferguson tractor attempting to live a quiet life with his son and Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez), but the tension is obvious. In these posters, Rodriguez is leaning up against a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Yamaha" rel="noopener">Yamaha</a> dirt bike.</p>
<p>Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson are back as Tej and Roman, respectively. Ludacris is shown with a 2018 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Acura/NSX">Acura NSX</a>, while Gibson is pictured with either a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Jeep/Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Jeep/Gladiator">Jeep Gladiator</a> â€“ either way, this Jeep has been heavily modified and looks cool. Jordana Brewster returns to a starring role for the first time since <em>Furious 7</em> as Mia Toretto, and she's paired with a 1970-72 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Nova">Chevy Nova</a> SS. Even Nathalie Emmanuel is back as hacker Ramsey, and she's lucky enough to get to drive a Noble M600 supercar.</p>

<p>Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron reprise their <em>Fast & Furious</em> roles, and there are many new faces joining the cast for <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em>. John Cena will play a major role in the film as he's shown in the posters flexing in front a blue <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/Mustang">Ford Mustang</a>; this is a bit of automotive irony, though, as Ford sued Cena over his attempt to sell a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/GT">Ford GT</a>. Other additions to the cast include Michael Rooker, Finn Cole and Cardi B.</p>
