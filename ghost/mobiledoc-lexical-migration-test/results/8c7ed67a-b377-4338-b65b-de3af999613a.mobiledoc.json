          "Resto-modded muscle cars from the late 1960s have become extremely popular in mainstream car culture for many reasons. On the one hand, you have the classic styling and great looks of the older models. However, vintage vehicles can often be notoriously outdated. Thankfully, you also get the other hand which holds modern technology's incredible performance and reliability. It's a beautiful thing to be able to swap whatever drivetrain, suspension, and interior components you like. Those must've been the exact thoughts of this young man who took it upon himself to restore and modify a car that had been in his family for generations."

          "The classic car in question is a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle built by a dedicated father and son team into a monster that is hard to beat. Under the hood, you can clearly see a 6.2-liter LS3 V8 engine which utilizes several modifications to make some big power numbers. One of these upgrades includes a \"hot cam,\" which operates a performance design to increase horsepower and torque numbers. You can thank that camshaft for producing 525 horsepower, which spins the rear wheels with tons of smoke. All that power is sent through a six-speed manual Tremec transmission, which fits with this build's autocross style. While the car has some extraordinary power, this car was made for tight turning and hard Gs."

          "That's why this Chevelle features SpeedTech suspension components and a roll cage that adds rigidity. Oddly enough, this incredible vehicle still boasts its original frame, which you definitely wouldn't expect with such a thorough build. This was a deliberate choice on the part of the father and son team, as the vehicle is still in the process of growth. Everything about this car, from the lovely sound of its idling camshaft to the heart-wrenching backstory, makes it the perfect classic car for the owner and his family. Having been owned first by the grandfather for 25 years, this young man eventually inherited the vehicle in an attempt on the grandfather's part to continue car culture for generations to come, and he has done it right."
