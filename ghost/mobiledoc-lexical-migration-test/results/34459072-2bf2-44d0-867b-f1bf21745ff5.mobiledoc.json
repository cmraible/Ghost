          "Over the weekend, a rare 1968 Holden HK GTS Monaro 327 Bathurst Coupe crossed the auction block at the Lloyds in Australia. The numbers-matching Australian muscle car caused quite a stir ahead of the auction, thanks in no small part to its breathtaking presentation. While it would be easy to believe it had been restored, the Holden was in fact an unrestored survivor with mostly original paint, if you can believe that."

Since it’s an iconic car for enthusiasts Down Under, many believed it would command more while on the auction block."

Considering the listing states only 57,593 miles showing on the odometer, it’s obvious the owner has used the muscle car gently in its impressively lengthy lifetime."
