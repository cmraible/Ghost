<h2 id="working-with-us">Working with us</h2>
<p>Advertising on BestTechie isn’t like most other places on the Internet. When you advertise on BestTechie, we consider you a lifetime partner of the site no matter how long your campaign with us may be. We only want to work with advertisers whose products and/or services we like and feel comfortable recommending, therefore, even when your campaign ends, chances are you can expect us to still talk about/recommend your product and/or service in the future. And because we’re picky about who we work with, you can expect to be in good company.</p>
