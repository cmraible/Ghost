<p>According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Labor compiled by the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the minimum wage is worth less today than it has ever been, compared to the average wage being earned by U.S. workers. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. minimum wage also lags behind that of the rest of the developed world. If it were raised to $15, it would rank third, behind Turkey and Chile.</p>
