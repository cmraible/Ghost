<p>Readly, the bundled news and mags digital subscription service, has <a href="https://news.cision.com/readly/r/readly-expands-its-portfolio-of-uk-newspapers-with-reach-plc-adding-four-titles,c3215417">added four Reach newspapers to its offer</a>: The<em> Daily Express, Daily Mirror, Sunday Express </em>and<em> Sunday Mirror. </em>A bunch of consumer mags are also (re)joining it: <em>Country Life, Horse & Hound, Wallpaper </em>and<em> Decanter.</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of skepticism out there about this style of product, which includes Apple News, but they certainly have the potential to grow revenue, as long as you have a viable additive strategy — “this is a way of getting revenue from people who wouldn't be regular readers” — that has built into it ways of making your core target audience direct subsribers: what can you offer them that isn't just the content in the app?</p>
<p>I suspect that these products <em>could</em> be a slow-burn success over time — but there won't be a lot of winners, if any. </p>
<h2 id="mmmm%E2%80%A6social-media-stats">Mmmm…Social Media Stats</h2>
<p>Lots of lovely crunchy goodness in a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/10/20/more-than-50-of-humans-in-the-world-use-social-media-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">new global social media snapshot</a>. I'm not going to attempt to summarise it here; if you need to know this level of data, dive in. </p>
<p>However, I do want to highlight this chart:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/06-Social-Platform-Ranking-DataReportal-20201018-Digital-2020-October-Statshot-Report-Slide-50.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/06-Social-Platform-Ranking-DataReportal-20201018-Digital-2020-October-Statshot-Report-Slide-50.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/06-Social-Platform-Ranking-DataReportal-20201018-Digital-2020-October-Statshot-Report-Slide-50.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/06-Social-Platform-Ranking-DataReportal-20201018-Digital-2020-October-Statshot-Report-Slide-50.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/06-Social-Platform-Ranking-DataReportal-20201018-Digital-2020-October-Statshot-Report-Slide-50.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>There won't be an awful lot of surprises for most of you reading this about the top end, but the bottom of the chart might be unexpected. It's interesting how (relatively) small Twitter use is, isn't it? It's below Pinterest, and only just above Quora. But I bet most people have a Twitter strategy, but not one for the other two sites…</p>

<h2 id="google-tools-for-journalists">Google Tools for Journalists</h2>
<p>Google has launched its journalist studio, which is basically a front end for a couple of interesting tools:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://commonknowledge.appspot.com"><strong>The Common Knowledge Project</strong></a> — a (US-only) tool that builds charts from local data using the <a href="https://www.datacommons.org">Data Commons</a>, an open data project. Potentially very useful to local journalists. Let's hope they have something similar coming to the UK and other countries. </li>
    <li><a href="https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/about"><strong>Pinpoint</strong></a><strong> —</strong> this is the really interesting one right now. It allows you to use advanced search techniques across libraries of documents and audio you upload into the tool. It's using AI-powered tech, as well as doing text recognition and audio transcription. As a way of extracting stories from big sets of files, this could be invaluable. </li>
</ul>
