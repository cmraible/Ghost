For those who are only familiar with cars, a simple turbo upgrade is something which provides a little bit more get-up-and-go but doesn’t absolutely transform a vehicle. However, on a motorcycle it can add quite the altering dimension of performance. That’s why it’s entertaining to see Bikes and Beards do just such a thing."

Sean is the brash one, the dreamer who makes the mess Craig has to then straighten out, yet these two seem to make it work. But can they make this boosted Harley work?"

All that combined made for a whopping 223-horsepower and 217 lb.-ft. of torque. Yeah, we know the Honda guys will brag their ride makes about that much, but keep in mind it ways multiple times more, so who’s laughing now?"

          "However, big power figures alone don’t make for an enjoyable or engaging ride. Just like with a car, if you’re creating gobs of horsepower and torque but can’t control it then all that is really for nothing. Considering the horsepower alone increased by 180% over stock, one would quickly realize some adjustments to other components, if not outright swapping them out for upgrades, would be necessary."

That was made possible by the axle getting a little squirrely with all that extra power. Long story short, they didn’t have a solution for that yet, but they decided to add racing fuel to squeeze as much power out of the setup as possible. Hey, they have their priorities straight."
