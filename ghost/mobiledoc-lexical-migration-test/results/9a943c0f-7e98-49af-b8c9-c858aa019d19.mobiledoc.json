Mechanically, it’s quite a standard first-person shooter but to make things unique, you can also use your trusty sword to slice and dice your foes with a tap of the X button, as well as repel attacks, reflect bullets by holding R bumper and even manipulate enemies with your mech arm, dragging enemies closer and using your EMP to obliterate them (which is very cool). There are also a few other skills that you’ll unlock later on after discovering scattered green artefacts that allow you to unlock new abilities and secondary ammo types for your guns later in the game.

You can use one of five different types of guns, such as an assault rifle, shotgun, handgun, sniper rifle and unique ammo types like sticky bombs and incendiary grenades (and don’t forget your trusty sword). During the first stages, you’ll be fighting armoured humans however, you’ll soon be introduced to the supernatural element which are these strange undead soldiers brandishing swords, axes, shields and crossbows among other ancient weaponry. Encounters against these supernatural monsters are really cool but not as cool as the mini bosses against the Chinese Guardian Lions or the towering mace-wielding giant. These encounters are equally thrilling and visually stunning to behold. "
