<p>It’s another day and yet another Dodge Charger Hellcat was stolen in the Detroit area, more specifically Sterling Heights. According to police, they gave chase to the Mopar muscle car on November 1 at about 4:20 pm after the owner was carjacked. The victim called 911 and claimed men with guns took the vehicle from him on Seaglass Drive close to 15 Mile and Van Dyke.</p>

<p>As one can imagine, police treat that kind of situation seriously. If suspects with guns were willing to use them to steal someone’s car, they’re definitely dangerous. Finding and arresting the suspects before they can seriously hurt or kill a victim is a pressing need.</p>

<p>According to the victim, one of the suspects got into the Hellcat and drove off with it. Three others got into a white car, but the report doesn’t mention what kind it was. We’d be interested if it was another Stellantis product, like a Charger, Jeep, etc.</p>
<p>Police started combing the area when they spotted the Hellcat. Since it’s black with red stripes all over it the thing sticks out like a sore thumb. A chase ensued and one patrol unit successfully deployed a stock stick, deflating at least one of the tires. With the car disabled, pursuing officers were able to stop the Dodge and arrest the driver.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, police tracked down the white car to some apartments in the area of 12 Mile and Van Dyke. The three suspects were arrested with the help of Warren police. One of those arrested is a juvenile and the others are adults.</p>
<p>That’s all the information the local news had about the chase and arrests at the time of writing this article. We don’t need more details to reiterate what we’ve said countless times: car theft is bad and getting worse, particularly in areas like Detroit. Hellcats are big targets of criminals in part because they’re fast and fun, plus in part because they seem to be relatively easy to steal. They’re even easier to take at gunpoint, which is a real concern. Staying aware of your surroundings at all times and not letting criminals get the drop on you is your best defense. And remember, sitting in a parked vehicle is actually really dangerous.</p>
