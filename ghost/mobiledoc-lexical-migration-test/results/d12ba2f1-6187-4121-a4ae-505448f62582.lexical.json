However, something that you'll notice this year's event had going for it was the ever-present lineup of Lamborghinis ready to show off their performance. another automobile whose drivers were ready to turn heads where the Ford Mustang. of course you know that where there are Mustangs, ",

Just behind the American Pony car, the Lamborghini slowed down and was able to stop in time to rescue his own vehicle.",

Thankfully it doesn't look like anybody got hurt but the mustang is going to need some serious work done to get it back up and running and then race condition.
