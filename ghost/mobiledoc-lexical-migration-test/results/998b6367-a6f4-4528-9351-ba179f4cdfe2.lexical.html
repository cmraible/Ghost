<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>I was on Rolling Stone’s podcast this week with Matt Taibbi and Katie Halper — and we got to talking a lot about my book “Back to Our Future.” That book was about how 1980s pop culture deep programmed today’s politics. I encourage you to watch/listen to the podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1NwGNk866c&list=PLL0ooGQ0asg4upSXzZA1Oinn3ALqVCndA&index=1">here</a> — and you are interested in the book, you can <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/196801/back-to-our-future-by-david-sirota/9780345518804/excerpt">read an excerpt here</a>. Also make sure to check this out, because it is kind of mind blowing:</p>

<p>This coming week, the Supreme Court battle will likely provide us a teachable lesson in how the political process distracts from what the court really does.</p>
<p>We probably won’t hear much about how Barrett has been a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/02/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-business-cronyism">reliable shill</a> for corporate interests, and we will instead hear a lot about how she is <a href="https://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP/status/1315303506237161472">supposedly</a> a judge who just calls balls and strikes — even though as <em>The Daily Poster</em><a href="/barrett-crushed-gig-workers-weeks/">reported</a>, just a few weeks ago she twisted an interpretation of the law in order to help corporations avoid paying overtime to workers.</p>
<p>The entire discourse about the Supreme Court is completely dishonest, especially the debate over so-called “court packing.” That’s an Orwellian term designed to denigrate any effort to make the court more representative of popular will. Indeed, if the founders wanted the court to be frozen at 9 justices, the would have written that into the constitution — but they didn’t. That suggests they wanted to give future generations flexibility to make sure the court didn’t become a star chamber wholly divorced from public accountability.</p>
<p>Oh, and we should all scoff at any Republican who derides the idea of changing the size of the court — read <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/11/03/500560120/senate-republicans-could-block-potential-clinton-supreme-court-nominees">this</a>, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-grassley-dc-circuit_n_4311984">this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffreyASachs/status/1314274900954304512">this</a> to know that the GOP has been engaged in court packing for years.</p>
<p>I’m betting none of this will be mentioned in this week’s screamfest on Capitol Hill and on cable TV news — after all, if we’ve learned anything in 2020, it is that the truth is rarely allowed to get in the way of The Narrative.</p>
<p>Of course, that up-is-down, war-is-peace dynamic is part of what we’re trying to challenge and counter here at <em>The Daily Poster</em>. We are part of a growing effort to democratize the media through grassroots funding and make it more focused on the things that actually matter.</p>
<p>This is a long-term project — so it is going to take years. It is a marathon not a sprint, even though I’m sure you can tell that we are sprinting every single day to report out the stories that matter. Thanks as always for being part of the team that makes that possible.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>

The court just issued this new ruling that could swing the closely contested Senate race in South Carolina.</em></p>
