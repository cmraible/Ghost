If you’re anything like the enthusiast responsible for this automobile, then it may be one of America’s most iconic small pickup trucks, the 1969 Chevrolet C10.",

One such price of work that has certainly improved the truck's capabilities over the years is the LT5 engine that sits under the hood. Not only is this a pretty feisty V8 engine but it’s also supercharged which helps the motor put out as much power as possible.",

While that 6.2-liter powerhouse is quite an astonishing piece of engineering, the gearbox is an equally important part of the equation. That’s exactly why the truck is supported via a 10L80 10-speed automatic transmission which is known for its strength. Overall, this is a stunning truck fit for any high speed driving or racing situations and the enthusiast behind the wheel is a mad genius for sure.",
