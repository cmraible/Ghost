A T56 six-speed manual transmission shifts power through an LS7 clutch and down to the 12-bolt Detroit Truetrac posi rear end with 4.11 gears. Approximately 66,000 miles were accumulated on the LS1 motor before installation. Mechanical highlights include a new Nick Williams throttle body, black Holley valve covers, Edelbrock headers, a custom radiator, and a custom 3-gallon coolant reservoir to keep everything running cool. The car also features an LSX Concepts race drive front accessory drive that was powder-coated black to match the engine bay. Quenching the thirst of the car is a new Walbro 455 fuel pump with new fuel lines, a Ricks stainless gas tank, and a new fuel pressure regulator. This combination that generates a pavement-stomping 581-horsepower after being tuned by JBA Speed Shop in San Diego and put on the dyno. "
