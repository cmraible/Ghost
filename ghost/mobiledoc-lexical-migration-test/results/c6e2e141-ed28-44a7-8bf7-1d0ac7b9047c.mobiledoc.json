With a dual overhead cam setup, it was an oddity. As they say, the proof is in the pudding and with 385-horsepower on tap that was enough to make enthusiasts believers. A 6-speed manual certainly helped."

As MotorWeek noted with a certain amount of glee, both cars outperformed the Ferrari Testarossa, so keep that in mind before disparaging the C4."
