Since the wreck, which looks horrifically violent, the teen’s condition improved. That’s when he reportedly started bragging on social media about his ill-advised escapades."

After all, most people don’t like to brag about having horrible driving skills, let alone breaking the law, but this kid seems to think all that gives him bragging rights."

Sadly, a lot of people who pay extra to live in secured neighborhoods like that don’t take the usual steps to secure their property. We’ve seen plenty of examples of this behavior, although it sounds like the owners at least didn’t just leave the key in the cupholder. Then again, a lot of regular people don’t lock their car when it’s sitting in the garage, like the automatic opener is Fort Knox."
