          "Without any modifications, the 1966 Cadillac DeVille convertible is a slick-looking classic with its slab-sided body, long proportions and lots of chrome, but this custom job took this car to the next level. After shaving off the door handles, some of the side body chrome and the front fender turn signals, this build was slammed with an AccuAir air ride suspension system and given 22-inch American Racing wheels. Looking at that killer stance, it's no surprise that this car was exhibited at AccuAir's SEMA booth in 2014."

The front bench seat was replaced by low-back heated buckets split with a custom center console, while the front and rear seat upholstery has a unique pattern. While the Cadillac's monster 7.0-liter V8 remains unmodified with a 340-horsepower output, the engine compartment has been dressed up with a painted air cleaner and valve covers."
