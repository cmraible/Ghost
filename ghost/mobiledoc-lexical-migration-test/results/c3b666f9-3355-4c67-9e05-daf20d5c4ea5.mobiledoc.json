We know there’s plenty of controversy about police seizures of private property, and we don’t know the circumstances around this one, so we’ll just leave it at that."

Quite frankly, we’ve always felt the Demon was a huge letdown after all the buildup about how incredibly powerful it was going to be. We’ve felt the same way about the “Last Call” Chargers and Challengers. Dodge could easily push a production Hellcat to this kind of power level, even if just for a very limited-edition model, but we’re willing to bet the powers that be at Stellantis and before that Fiat Chrysler don’t like the idea for some dumb reasons."

It’s also a slick-top with the lights mounted on the cabin side of the windshield as well as in the grille, fenders, and rocker panels. We especially like the lights in the hood scoops – such a cool addition."
