The rear of the car received a similar reinforced bumper, custom fiberglass mud flaps and that totally awesome whip antenna! Custom 15-inch steelies were created for this build, and they come wrapped in somewhat meaty VR-rated tires allowing this Dino to balance traction and high speeds.",

That long wheelbase is a product of this car's 2+2 design, but this 308 Dino GT4 was equipped with the rare factory-delete rear seat option.
