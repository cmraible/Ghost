<p>If you’re a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/instead-of-a-vacation/">diehard car person</a>, it’s entirely possible you don’t know anything about Magnus Walker’s work as a fashion designer and you probably don’t care about it, either. However, you might already know the bearded British guy is an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/collector-cars-15k/">avid car collector</a>, particularly of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-the-official-porsche-birthday-party-unfold/">Porsches</a>. Actually, he says he’s a “builder, driver, and collector” of Porsches, because he does all three.</p>

<p>According to Walker, his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">obsession with Porsche</a> started about four decades ago. Over time he’s accumulated all kinds of Porsches, plus memorabilia and a ton of knowledge. He claims that not a day goes by now that he’s not doing something with a Porsche. When you see his garage/warehouse that’s easy to believe.</p>
<p>It took Walker 15 years after he first fell in love with Porsches as a child to acquire his first one. The real question is if he worked as a fashion designer just so he could get his hands on more Porsches? It wouldn’t be difficult to believe it if that were the truth.</p>

<p>A recent report from Business Insider claims Walker’s Porsche collection is worth $7.5 million. He’s been able to pull together quite a few extremely rare, low-production cars, which helps explain how his collection if worth so much. For example, he owns a 1971 Porsche 911 T affectionately known as 277. Walker has raced it all over, giving the car such a reputation it’s been reproduced as a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-hot-wheels/">Hot Wheels toy</a> and photographed plenty of times.</p>
<p>As noted before, Walker doesn’t just collect Porsches, he also builds them. The man dressed a lot of rock stars back in the day with his flair for in-your-face style, and that’s what he applies to cars as well. In fact, the cars Walker has customized often sell for top dollar on the market, proving he has a gold touch with Porsches.</p>

<p>If anything, Walker’s relentless drive to collect and enjoy the cars he loves is inspiring. After all, he’s just a gearhead like the rest of us, enjoying sharing his passion with like-minded people.</p>
