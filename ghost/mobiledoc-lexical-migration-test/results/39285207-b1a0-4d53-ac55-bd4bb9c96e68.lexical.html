<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-bel-airs-on-motorious/">The 1957 Bel Air</a> is one of the most iconic American cars ever made. When you think of the 1950s, you think of the Bel Air; you’ll even see the likeness of the Bel Air on art clips to promote the 50s to this day. It’s one of the most distinguished classes for the era, and it always surprises us to find one to pop up under barn find searches, but this barn find Bel Air is not in the rough condition we’ve seen before.</p>

<p>When we say <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1957-chevrolet-bel-air-barn-find-leads-to-field-full-of-classics/">barn find</a>, we’re talking literal barn in this car, but find is maybe a little hyperbolic, maybe more like barn forgotten, or barn parked, and then someone bought the land with the barn on it and inherited it. The current seller/owner decided to keep the car because they knew it was special, and it’s apparently been parked since sometime around 1969, stating it still has the 1969 plates on it. 1969 would have made it a 12-year-old vehicle when parked, so it was maybe getting inside the window of needing some extra maintenance, but still had tons of good days ahead of it.</p>

<p>The condition of the car is pretty decent, with the pink and blue paint needing help, and it’s likely going to need a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-restoration-supreme-court/">full restoration</a> even beyond that. Still, it’s very intact and would be a nice project to bring home.</p>
