At about 4 am on May 18 a robbery suspect picked the wrong guy to carjack. The owner of a C8 Corvette felt his life was in danger, so he pulled out a gun and shot the suspect several times. That person then jumped on a car which was driving away, but fell off it and died in the parking lot."

Criminals often use those transitionary spaces to attack, figuring you’re not as on guard and therefore an easier target. Being ready to deal with a sudden threat is the key, which appears to be exactly what happened in this case."
