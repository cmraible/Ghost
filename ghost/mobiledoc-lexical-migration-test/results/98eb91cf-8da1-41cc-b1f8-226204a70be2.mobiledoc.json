          "What a handsome machine! Finished in a beautiful shade of blue with a contrasting white roof, this 280SE was a true mark of success back in the 1960s and 70s. That huge grille and three-pointed-star serve as a substantial status symbol.  While clearly a luxury vehicle, the W108 model is certainly a touch more sporting than its W111 predecessor — 60mm lower ride hight and wider doors gave it better road presence."

Opening the door of this 1971 model highlights what great taste its original owner had, with the spacious cabin featuring blue leather and a contrasting light wooden trim. Royal blue carpeting and chimed switching complete this very special interior."

The description also says that its 3.5-liter M116 V8 engine and automatic transmission is in great working order thanks to regular maintenance. Its full documentation should give potential buyers plenty of confidence in this classic reading just shy of 81,000 miles on the clock."
