Now that’s the type of sin worthy of cancellation, but the man really blasphemed by encouraging people to keep driving their older internal combustion engine cars as a means of conservation. Outrageous!"

          "Every day, there’s a deluge of news stories designed to make it appear EVs are far more popular than they are, like people will just buy one out of sheer peer pressure. The fact is they’ve barely cracked seven percent of the market in the US, a figure that’s likely to drop as the year progresses. And while the Model Y will likely be the best-selling vehicle for 2023 that’s by far thanks to the Chinese Communist Party using both carrot and stick to herd its population into EVs. Obviously, that authoritarian regime is a model of how every government should be run."
