<p>The wonderful supercharged 6.2-liter LT5 V8 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1981-pontiac-trans-am/">crate engine</a> from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/copo-camaro-2022/">Chevrolet Performance</a> has officially been canceled. That’s a disappointing thing for enthusiasts to hear, especially those who were plotting the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/custom-chevy-impala-garage-build/">perfect build</a> with that at the center. However, even though the supercharged LT5 isn’t being made anymore, there are some out there, so if you move quickly enough you might be able to still scoop one up.</p>

<p>With a monstrous 755-horsepower and 715 lb.-ft. of torque on tap, the LT5 made its raucous debut in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-z06-driver-crashes/">C7 Corvette Z06</a>. To achieve those wondrous figures, bolted up is an R2650 TVS 2.65-liter supercharger, which supplies 14 psi of boost.</p>
<p>Many pointed out that LT5 crate engine was GM’s compelling answer to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-infused-c10/">Hellcat crate engine</a>. It seemed Chevrolet Performance would be giving Mopar a good run for its money, with enthusiasts winning out big. Why the LT5 crate engine was given the axe isn’t clear, but it sure is disappointing.</p>
<p>A leading theory is that Chevrolet Performance is getting ready to release a lineup of C8 Corvette crate engines, including the flat-plane crank V8 from the upcoming C8 Z06. That might help everyone feel a little better about this sudden move</p>
<p>Reportedly, GM was considering using it for a 6th-gen Camaro Z/28, but for whatever set of reasons that project was abandoned. It was also rumored the C8 Z06 engine was under consideration, but that’s not happening, either.</p>
<p>Camaro fans have been left to wonder what might have been had the LT5 been used in their beloved pony. Others have gauged building their own 6th-gen Z/28 using the LT5 and we’ve seen a few builds. If that’s still what you want to do, better get a move on it and also contact us once the build is done, because we definitely want to see it.</p>
