<p>We don’t know what the deal is with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/group-stealing-performance-cars/">North Carolina car dealerships</a> getting hit by thieves, but stories <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/muscle-cars-stolen-dealer/">like this recent one</a> out of Henderson are all starting to pretty much <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-hit-dealer/">blend together</a>. In this latest case, surveillance footage shows a group of several thieves break into a showroom, find the keys for several cars, and drive them right out into the parking lot before disappearing into the night.</p>

<p>The incident in question happened back on April 16. Ultimately, they got away with the Camaro, plus a Cadillac Escalade and Audi Q5. All three are expensive rides and the thieves likely knew that, which was why they looked for those specific keys.</p>

<p>For reasons not detailed out in a local news report, the thieves abandoned the Escalade the next day in Matthews, North Carolina where police found it. The suspects are still on the loose and the other two cars haven’t been recovered.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of discussion about why car dealerships don’t take more drastic measures to secure keys at night. Considering they’ve become a favorite target of thieves in the past three years or so, it’s a fair question. Surely they’re losing a good chunk of money when these cars are stolen? Or is the insurance covering everything? But wouldn’t this widespread problem lead to higher insurance rates?</p>
<p>We have heard some dealerships have started moving keys off-site during the night, but this seems to not be a common practice. Of course that opens up a whole new risk of the person who transports the keys getting held up, or wherever you keep the keys overnight becoming a target of thieves. After all, car thieves have become rather aggressive and seem to face few consequences for their actions in a lot of areas, so it’s no wonder why.</p>
