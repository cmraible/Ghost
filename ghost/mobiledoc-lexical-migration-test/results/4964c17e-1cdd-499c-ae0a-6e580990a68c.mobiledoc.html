<p>Corporate executive pay skyrocketed in 2020 during the pandemic while workers, hailed as heroes, saw their wages stagnate. New data from the Economic Policy Institute found that CEOs saw their compensation jump by 16 percent during the pandemic while average worker pay increased at a rate that just beat inflation.</p>
<p>Also, survival checks had huge, albeit temporary, effects on people’s lives, and while Joe Biden has made new moves to stem Arctic drilling, his heart might not really be in it. Learn more in today’s Midday Poster below, exclusively for subscribers!</p><!--members-only-->

<p>“Let’s be serious. Every Democrat in Congress probably has some sort of real estate investments going on or they have many wealthy friends who do and wealthy lobbyists who do. So it would surprise me if this actually does go through.” — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/talk-of-trump-2024-run-builds-as-legal-pressure-intensifies">Joe McBride</a>, head of commercial real estate finance at analytics company Trepp, on the likelihood of Democrats repealing a special tax break that allows real estate investors to evade taxes on gains made through the resale of property if they redeploy them after six months.</p>

<p>CEOs got a huge boost during the pandemic while worker compensation effectively stagnated. According to <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/preliminary-data-show-ceo-pay-jumped-nearly-16-in-2020-while-average-worker-compensation-rose-1-8/">new data</a> from the Economic Policy Institute, CEOs saw a 16 percent increase in compensation in 2020 while the COVID-19 swept the country. Workers, who were left to face the virus with little protection, saw their pay increase by a mere 1.8 percent — barely beating the <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the%20rate%20of,which%20was%201.2%25%20in%202020.">1.4 percent inflation rate</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, while corporate executives were raking in money and corporate America was offering lip service to frontline workers, calling them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/arts/pandemic-ads-salute-you.html">heroes</a> in emotional ads, those same workers weren’t benefitting at all from the wealth they were generating.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, amid reports that many workers are declining to return to low-paying jobs, corporate America has been lobbying to end the $300 pandemic unemployment assistance. Last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the biggest business lobbying group in the country, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/us-chamber-of-commerce-rips-300-jobless-benefit-calls-for-repeal.html">joined the fight</a> to strip workers of their federal unemployment benefits and force them back into unsafe, low-wage jobs.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>Survival checks substantially improved American life according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/politics/stimulus-checks-economic-hardship.html?fbclid=IwAR0_b89p2z64k8MumEZ6fJ-OFpIE6Hhds6S2FReor7vlQzhMFvtG57kfW4o">new analysis</a> of U.S. Census data. After the $600 and $1,400 checks went out, there was a 42 percent decline in the number of households with children experiencing food shortages from January to April, a 43 percent decline in financial instability, and a more than 20 percent decline in anxiety and depression. However, these improvements were only temporary, because the checks were one-time payments.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>Eleven years ago, on June 15, 2010, President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127862326">addressed</a> the nation to discuss the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which he called “the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.” Promising BP would pay for the damage, the president said that disaster proved the time had come to “embrace a clear energy future.”</p>
<p>"We can't afford not to change how we produce and use energy — because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater," Obama said.</p>
<p>Five years and two months later, however, Obama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/29/obama-arctic-drilling-alaska-trip-climate-change">allowed Shell to drill</a> for oil in the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska. As he was leaving office roughly a year and a half later, Obama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/20/barack-obama-bans-oil-gas-drilling-arctic-atlantic">tried to reverse</a> himself, banning new drilling in the Arctic before Donald Trump took office.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Interior Department <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/01/biden-anwr-alaska-oil-491498">announced</a> that Biden is suspending all oil and gas leases in Alaska’s National Wildlife Refuge in order to better study the environmental impacts. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/climate/biden-alaska-drilling.html">days earlier</a>, the administration filed a brief to defend in court a Trump-era oil and gas drilling project by ConocoPhillips in the North Slope of Alaska, which environmental groups claim did not take into account environmental impacts. The Interior Department is arguing that the Trump administration complied with environmental requirements and that ConocoPhillips’ lease is valid. The project, known as Willow, is set to produce 100,000 barrels of oil per day for the next 30 years. In January, Biden issued an executive order to examine “legal deficiencies” in the leasing program.</p>

<p><strong>• NINA TURNER HOLDS COMMANDING LEAD:</strong> A new poll from Tulchin Research <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/nina-turner-leads-poll-11th-congressional-district-race/95-5842fe8f-4824-4185-8020-c0f16a47da96">shows</a> that former Bernie Sanders surrogate and state senator Nina Turner holds a commanding lead in her race for Congress. According to the poll, Turner has the support of 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in Ohio’s 11th congressional district.</p>
<p><strong>• CUTTING UNEMPLOYMENT PROBABLY WON’T HELP BUSINESSES: </strong>Cutting off federal unemployment during the ongoing pandemic is cruel, and it may not push many people back into the workplace, either. New research from the <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/05/27/job-search-activity-jumps-states/">Indeed Hiring Lab</a> found that “job search activity on Indeed increased, relative to the national trend, in states that announced they would end federal UI benefits prematurely,” but the “increase was temporary, vanishing by the eighth day after the announcement.” States cutting off unemployment are also <a href="https://twitter.com/pelhamprog/status/1400437514666745862">rejecting billions of dollars</a>, which will mean fewer customers.</p>
<p><strong>• DEREK CHAUVIN LAWYER SAYS KILLER COP SHOULDN’T GO TO PRISON: </strong>In a new court filing, the attorney for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murdering George Floyd, has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/02/derek-chauvin-sentence-attorney-argues-probation-no-prison-time/7512199002/">requested</a> that his client avoid prison time or serve less than the maximum sentence. Chauvin is the product of a “broken system,” the filing argues. Sentencing is set for June 25.</p>
<p><strong>• SACKLER FAMILY POISED TO GET IMMUNITY FROM OPIOID LAWSUITS: </strong>A federal judge in New York <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/02/1002085031/sackler-family-empire-poised-to-win-immunity-from-opioid-lawsuits">moved a controversial bankruptcy plan forward</a> for Purdue Pharma that included third party, non-debtor liability shields for the family members and more than 170 companies and more than 160 financial trusts they are associated with. Final approval of the plan is expected by August.</p>
