Despite manufacturer claimed top-speeds of all three cars being over 130-mph, these particular cars were all only able to get up to the mid 120s."

          "With a finely tuned suspension and enough weight to corral its power, the Camaro proved to be 9/10-second faster than the Trans Am and a full second faster than the Mustang. Davis’ final consensus in this 1985 battle of the muscle cars is that the Mustang is the fastest and the Camaro IROC-Z is the most refined, while the Trans Am falls somewhere between the two. At the conclusion of this golden retro review, Davis hopes for an unending debate about who builds the best muscle car. Although Pontiac has since bowed out of the fight Dodge has recently stepped up and this brawl is still going strong."
