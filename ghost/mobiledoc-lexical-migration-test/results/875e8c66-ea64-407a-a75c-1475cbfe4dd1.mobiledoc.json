The month before the Dish moved, it was 27 million pageviews for the Beast vs 21 million for the Atlantic. The gap in pageviews between the two sites has gone in one month from 6 million to 24 million. Since ads are sold on pageviews, that has got to mean something long-term. Quite what I don’t really know.</div>\n\nI’m sure you can come up with one or two suggestions…\n\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top:10px;height:15px\">[![Enhanced by Zemanta](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2011/05/zemified_a4.png?w=960)](http://www.zemanta.com/ \"Enhanced by Zemanta\")</div>\n"
