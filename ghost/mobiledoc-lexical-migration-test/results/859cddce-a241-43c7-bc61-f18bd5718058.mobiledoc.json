However, it only takes a single day before everyone is dragged into the game's plot as the metaverse has returned and somehow people are taking advantage of it to control the general public. The story already has me hooked due to Igor currently absent from the Velvet Room, the metaverse returning, and catching up on all the characters that made me fall in love with the game. The flow of the plot feels relatively natural for the characters to meet up on their summer break, however it is still yet to be seen whether it feels forced due to the metaverse returning with no explanation so far."
