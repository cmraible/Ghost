<hr>
<p>The Corvette is an American hero in the sports car market. This model came out swinging against the notion that a car can have performance and a certain level of luxury, while also being made in America. What the moniker has evolved into is basically an affordable exotic or supercar, but it's where it came from that we're talking about today. Here are some of the coolest classic Corvettes for sale on Motorious. </p>

<p>Here we see a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/217355/1967-chevrolet-corvette-convertible">1967 Corvette</a> with the stinger hood. Born as a power example Corvette with a matching numbers 427 390-horsepower engine, correct Holley Intake and carburetor and 4-speed Muncie transmission. It has the classic Sting Ray look. Nimble, very fast, and the look from 1967, Harley Earl's team was definitely at the top of their game, and this car is at the top of the power chain. Exterior Deep Tuxedo Black painstakingly applied shows beautifully and is definitely the deep end of the pool as to paint quality.</p>

<p>The popularity of some of America's greatest muscle cars has grown to the point that components, and even complete replicas, are produced as entirely new assemblies. Of course, being an astute enthusiast, you already knew that. Think about it: when was the last time you saw an original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby Cobra</a>? The replicar phenomenon gained even more momentum when Congress passed the Low Volume Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Act of 2015 and, finally in 2019, outlined regulations that will pave the way for niche builders to assemble complete cars. With that in mind, it seems perfectly logical that this killer Superformance Corvette, a GM-licensed continuation of Zora Arkus Duntov's legendary first-<a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/217318/1963-superformance-corvette-grand-sport">generation Grand Sport</a>, happily prowls the streets as a 2018 Chevrolet.</p>

<p>Awarded a Top Flight in 2017 at an NCRS Sanctioned event. Purchased locally from the man who oversaw the restoration of this car that spent most of its life in Nebraska we are proud to have it in our inventory. The seller holds a 1976 Nebraska title that was transferred to our local owner in 2012. Then he started down restoration road and he had only one goal- Top Flight. He did it and the car is magnificent. What could possibly be better than a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/217124/1957-chevrolet-corvette">black Fuelie</a> with red interior and silver coves? Not much in our humble estimation.</p>

In 1976, the IMSA sanctioning body changed the rules of road racing to allow full tube frame cars to compete in the premier North American Road Racing series. John Greenwood saw a major opportunity to design and build the next generation of racing Corvettes.</p>
