Around back is a full-size spare on a swing-out carrier, so you have full access to the flip-down tailgate."

Other modern features include three-point seatbelts in the front and rear, dual cupholders, lockable center console, new AC, Dakota Digital gauges, and a Kenwood double-din stereo connected to a backup camera mounted on the tire carrier.

Enhancing drivability further is a complete overhaul of the suspension with Bilstein shocks, plus the steering and brake systems. The whole thing rolls on big 33-inch tires, perfect for wheeling in just about any environment."
