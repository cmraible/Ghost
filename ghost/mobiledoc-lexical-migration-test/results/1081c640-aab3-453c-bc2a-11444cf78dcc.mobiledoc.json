The 2002 pickup  is based on the 10th generation for the F-Series Ford trucks, but it got  a special supercharged 5.4-liter that helped it lay down 380-horsepower  and 450 lb-ft of torque from the factory. This example has been  modified to reach 450-horsepower and over 480 lbs of torque. Backing the  engine is a four-speed automatic transmission that feeds power to the  rear tires, and it rides on a custom suspension to keep it grounded."
