Like we’re talking the muscle car is probably a salvage at this point and she didn’t even crash it… much. Stories like this makes us wonder if these criminals just really hate their car or are sadistic or just plain evil or something – we’re traumatized. To understand why, read on, but you might want some tissues handy."

The officer remembered that Chelsea Davis was known to drive just such a car and that she had a felony forgery warrant, so he pulled his vehicle in front of the Chevy, trapping it in the spot."

Raising the tension further was the fact Davis locked the doors and refused to get out. That’s when the officer told her what she probably already knew: she would be going to jail that night."

When she asked to call her dad the officer agreed and walked off, going back to his car, getting out a spike strip, and positioning it in the parking lot by his vehicle. That’s pretty tricky."

          "Taking surface streets, the fourth tire gave out and that’s when Davis got the empowering idea to get on Interstate 30, because that’s what you should do when driving on alloy wheels and quickly deteriorating rubber compound. Thinking she was Steve McQueen, maybe because she listens to Sheryl Crow too much (which would be at all), Davis pushed the poor Camaro to almost 100 mph. Now, a sane person would know they’re caught and driving like this is incredibly dangerous, but being a faithful Sheryl Crow fan she wasn’t about to let the system beat her. Nevertheless, she persisted."

She should also be charged for wantonly desecrating a Camaro. Someone get us in touch with the Texas legislature, we have an idea for a new law."
