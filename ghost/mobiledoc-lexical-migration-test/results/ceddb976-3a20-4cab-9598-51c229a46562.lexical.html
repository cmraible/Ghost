<p>Hello, all,</p>
<p>Here's a quick update on what's happing with the members-only section of the site. I'm sorry for the paucity of updates in recent weeks. Like so many others, I've been reinventing my business on the fly, as the mix of lockdown and the schools being shut have halved my available working time, while my diary emptied with alarming speed, as the bottom fell out of the face-to-face training and consultancy market.</p>
<p>I've long loathed the tech startup world's obsession with the world "pivot" - but that hasn't stopped me pivoting like a drunken tango dancer on a cruise ship in high waves…</p>
<p>It's pretty clear that - if I'm going to remain solvent - I need to find sources of income that aren't dependent on me standing in rooms in front of people. The membership offer here is one part of that, and running online courses in another. I've run two now, and am warming to the format. There's a value in delivering things in smaller chunks, which people can then explore in their work before the next session, I think. </p>
<p><em>(And "hello" to the people from the Analytics course that was one of those two, who have free membership of the site for a year, to allow them access to the notes, and for being lovely enough to stick with the course after a sudden change in format…)</em></p>
<p>I have a big project delivering some training videos coming up, but after that, getting the site up and running as a paid proposition is my main priority. The formal launch is mid-May, but I will be putting pieces in place, and gently promoting it in the meantime. </p>
<p>In future, the members' updates will be more prosaic than this, lagely listing new member-exclusive content. But I hope you'll excuse me the personal touch in this one. </p>
<p>Out of the gate, this is what I'm going to be offering:</p>
<h2 id="the-one-man-his-blog-offer">The One Man & His Blog offer</h2>
<p>This will be the launch members' content:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A minimum of three member's only "news you can use" emails a week. These will be a mix of <em>highly</em> curated links with accompanying analysis (my feedback group made it clear that they are time-poor and the most useful links are what they are after) and <em>actionable </em>analysis/opinion pieces. I'll be delivering free content only once I'm sure I can hit target on the member content. </li>
    <li>Evolving online guides to SEO, Analytics and (possibly - depending on time) Audience Engagement best practice. If that isn't there out of the gate, it will be there by June. You can see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/essential-analytics/">the Analytics resource taking form here</a> - but you'll need to be logged in. Keep checking back. I have four more pages in draft, and hope to publish them soon. </li>
    <li>I'm also planning on running free online seminars for members only, addressing single relevant issues in detail. These will be available afterwards as both videos and written articles. The frequency will depend a lot on how many members I manage to acquire. </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you lot are getting all that, too.</p>
<p>New subscribers will <em>also</em> get the warm fuzzy feeling of helping support my on-going work and research, and helping feed my lovely daughters, for less than the cost of a couple of posh coffees. </p>
<p>That's the plan. What do you think? </p>

<p><em>The header image - for the curious - is my old Famous Five Club membership card, probably from the 70s.
