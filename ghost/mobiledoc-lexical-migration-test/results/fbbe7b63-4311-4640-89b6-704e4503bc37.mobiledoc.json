As a works Ford man, he was routinely the fastest Escort driver out there. His hat-trick of wins on the RAC Rally of Great Britain in 1973-75 was testament to this. Nevertheless, Mäkinen lost his seat with Ford to Bjorn Waldegard in 1977 before winding down his career."

          "Given that he was 30 years old by the time he won a round of the WRC, the 1994 1000 Lakes Rally, you could argue that this Finn was a late bloomer. He more than made up for lost time, though. From 1996-99, he soared, taking four consecutive titles for Mitsubishi. He became inextricably linked with the marque to the point that it produced a Tommi Mäkinen edition Lancer Evo VI to commemorate his greatness. Nevertheless, he took his final WRC win driving for arch-rival Subaru, claiming honours on the 2002 Monte Carlo Rally after on-the-road winner Sébastien Loeb was penalised."

          "Loeb began rallying in 1995, and in 2001 he became the Junior World Rally Champion. A year later he was driving a works Citroen – and the rest is history. He took his maiden WRC win that same season on the Rallye Deutschland, and in 2003 he missed out on the WRC title by one point to Petter Solberg. He made amends in 2004 and owned the WRC thereafter to 2012. His tally of nine consecutive WRC titles is unlikely to be beaten any time soon. What’s more, during the period of 2005-12, he failed to win only three rounds that were staged on asphalt."

          "Forever remembered flying the friendly skies in a Lancia Stratos in Alitalia war paint, Munari won the 1967 and ’69 Italian Rally Championship titles before scooping the European series in 1973. The Italian took his first Monte Carlo Rally win in a Fulvia HF in 1972, before taking a further hat-trick in 1975-77. He was also garlanded with the 1977 FIA Cup for Rally Drivers’ title. His career petered out during the early 1980s, with the veteran competing in everything from a Dodge Ramcharger to a Porsche 911 as and when the mood took him."
