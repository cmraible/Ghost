<p>There’s no denying the appeal of a classic Corvette Stingray. While this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/111289/1965-chevrolet-corvette-prostreet" rel="noopener">1965 Chevrolet Corvette</a> has a striking design with a red on silver paint scheme, what’s under the hood will truly blow you away once you lay the hammer down. Available currently from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/162973/1991-acura-nsx">Streetside Classics</a>, this C2 is looking for a new home.</p>
<p>Breathing life into this build is a fiery 468 cubic inch V8 that was built by Robert Norez. Among the impressive upgrades are a Holley 780 Dominator four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, 454 heads made of aluminum, aluminum pulleys, steel braided lines, a Stewart high flow water pump, big aluminum radiator, and a Moroso 7 quart drag race oil pan, to name just a few.</p>

<p>There are even headers connected to a side-exit exhaust, emphasizing this isn’t just some street cruiser but instead is a serious build for destroying tracks. Transferring all of that power to the rear wheels is a Hughes Performance Pro-Glide Powerglide transmission - it uses a Hughes Flexplate, plus a Hughes trans brake and 4,500 stall.</p>
<p>Of course, you want to tear up the asphalt and not your suspension, which has been upgraded to handle the additional power. Up front, improved A-arms help with steering duties. In the rear the four-link setup has been reinforced. With adjustable coilovers at all four corners of the car, you can choose the best setting for pretty much any situation. Four-wheel disc brakes also help keep the massive power in check.</p>
<p>There’s a full NHRA roll cage, announcing to everyone that this isn’t your typical Corvette, plus it’s hinged for easy access to the interior. A color-matched hardtop is available, in case you want to attempt driving this car in cooler weather or feel like making the car more of a sleeper.</p>
<p>Even the interior is all business. Two racing seats and Simpson racing harnesses keep you securely in place. A Grant sports steering wheel and Precision Performance shifter give you a sense or superior control. Thanks to the AutoMeter Sport-Comp gauge package and Auto Rods Controls Model 4000 touch panel control, you can keep an eye on all the car’s vitals.</p>
<p>This professionally-built ‘Vette comes with restoration photos plus a reproduction build-sheet, so you know it was built correctly by some of the biggest names in the business.</p>
