<p>Following the Pontiac GTO dominating the muscle car world, GM needed some kind of car to compete in the pony car class against the Mustang and Cougar. In 1967, they did just that by introducing the Pontiac Firebird, and it's cousin the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dead-chevy-camaro/">Chevy Camaro</a>. Since then, the pony car wars have carried on, with models like the Dodge Challenger joining the niche, and Pontiac dropping out of the race in 2002, but the Camaro carrying on nonethless. </p>

<p>In 1992 the Pontiac division of GM changed its decade old theme line from “We build excitement” to “We are driving excitement.” This new campaign shifted emphasis from overall branding to supporting individual models.

This is in the form of a 2002 Firebird Trans Am collector's edition. Approximately a mere 2,391 units were produced, (1,396 manual, 995 automatic), <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/235729/2002-pontiac-firebird-trans-am">and this one</a> is a completely stock.</p>
