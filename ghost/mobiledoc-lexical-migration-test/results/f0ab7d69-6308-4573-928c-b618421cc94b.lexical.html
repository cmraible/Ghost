<p>The 1969 Jaguar XKE saw plenty of changes from the two prior model years due to an abundance of safety and emissions regulations from the United States. This included larger front turn signal lights and taillights all relocated to places above or below the bumper, along with side marker lights as part of the design. For safety, seats now came with headrests.</p>
<p>Finished in a brilliant red, this classic Jaguar was once repainted with the body showing in fantastic shape. In fact, only 3,000 actual miles have accumulated on this stunning vintage vehicle. Contrasting tan leather can be found throughout the cabin and shows in immaculate condition. </p>
<p>Powering this elegant Jaguar XKE II Roadster is a 4.2-liter XK inline-six topped with dual Stromberg carburetors and mated to a 4-speed manual transmission. An aluminum radiator with dual side electric fans keeps everything running nice and cool. Capable of 246-horsepower with 263 lb/ft of torque from the factory, this classic convertible is no slouch. </p>
<p>While under the knife, everything was restored on this gem including the engine, transmission, rear, and clutch. All of the parts found on the car were ordered directly from England. In October 2019, Performance Racing brakes were installed with 11-inch rotors, aluminum piston calipers, new upper and lower ball joints on the front end, two power performance boosters, and master cylinder. The shocks, brakes, and calipers were replaced earlier in 2019.</p>
