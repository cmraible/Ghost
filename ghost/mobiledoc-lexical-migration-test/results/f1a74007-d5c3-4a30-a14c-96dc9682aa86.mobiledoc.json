Are the global shortages simply the effect of pandemic-related shutdowns, or is the planet’s production system in need of a massive overhaul? In this edition of Weekend Reader, we highlight several stories that delve deep into the supply chain woes spreading across the globe — and explore how part of the blame can be traced back to corporate monopolies and neoliberal outsourcing policies."

It’s a political and policy story. The consolidation of power over supply chains in the hands of Wall Street, and the thinning out of how we make and produce things over forty years in the name of efficiency, has made our economy much less resilient to shocks. These shortages are the result.”"

Today, whole industries in the West—from medical equipment to chip and car makers to food—rely on China for finished products and key components. When China cannot (or decides not to) supply these parts, whole industries suffer debilitating supply chain shortages. The notion of a rational, self-regulating market system is unraveling and may yet presage the demise of the prevailing neoliberal era.”"

In practice, these arrangements have tended to enrich the foreigners while doing little to deliver on the promised benefits, said José Luis Palma Herrera, a Honduran researcher who has written about ZEDEs. This year, skeptical Hondurans organized weeks of anti-ZEDE protests across the country. They fear cities like Próspera will leave ordinary people no better off than they were before, while ceding to profit-driven investors the power to decide what’s in the public interest.”"

If the festival didn’t get to be the stuff of legend for their generation, maybe it could be for the next. ‘He’s on this mission to tell these stories as sort of a larger restoration project of Black history, and to show that Black history is American history.’ Thompson encourages us to imagine a world in which Black music history isn’t merely consumed but is venerated and treated like the cultural monument it is — like the way it already exists to him.”"
