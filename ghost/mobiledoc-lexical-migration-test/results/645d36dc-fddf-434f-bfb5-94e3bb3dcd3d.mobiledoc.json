This distinctive muscle car is powered by a numbers-matching 403-cubic-inch V-8 engine and is shifted by an automatic transmission that twists a 2.41 rear axle. Even more, power brakes bring everything to a halt, and power steering allows easily maneuvering of those corners. Inside the car sits a black vinyl standard interior complete with an AM/FM radio and air conditioning."
