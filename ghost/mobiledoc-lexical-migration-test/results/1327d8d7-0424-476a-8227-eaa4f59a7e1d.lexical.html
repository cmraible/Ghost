<p>We’re not big fans of <em>Friends</em> of Jennifer Aniston’s brand of “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/kevin-hart-mint-condition/">comedy</a>” but we did find it amusing when she recently told the media about buying a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Mercedes%20Benz/280%20SL%20Roadster">Mercedes-Benz 280SL</a> with her first paycheck from <em>Friends</em>. The actress had her eye on the classic German convertible, which she said “had a for sale sign on it for almost two years.” That’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/drive-these-cars/">red flag</a>.</p>

<p>Aniston was shocked to learn the Mercedes wasn’t exactly in tip-top shape. For $13,000 in the late 90s, we’re not sure just what kind of condition she expected the 280SL to be in. After driving it twice, the car “never drove again.”</p>
<p>She said the classic car “was a lemon.” We’d love to know what exactly was wrong with the vehicle, but Aniston didn’t disclose that in her interview. We wonder if she had any idea. Instead, she wrote the car off, probably selling it to someone who took the time and care to figure out the problem and fix it.</p>
<p>Hey, we’re not complaining that some people just throw away cars like they’re used shoes once they stop working. That gives us an opportunity to buy them for cheap, fix the problems, and enjoy a great vehicle. Considering that 280SL is likely worth a small fortune today, we don’t advise going to Jennifer Aniston for advice on what to do with your ride.</p>
<p>It sounds like she might still not understand what kind of opportunity she blew. Aniston kept getting plenty of paychecks from Friends and so was likely able to buy a new Mercedes or BMW or whatever she wanted at the time. After all, those will work if you just put gas in them and drive, at least for a little while. Then it’s time to blow another paycheck on a new car.</p>
