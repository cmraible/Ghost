It's ok if you've never heard of the 1997 Dodge Ram Richard Petty Signature Series as only 500 examples were built that year (in addition to the 1,400 made in 1996) featuring NASCAR style and Richard Petty branding. If that wasn't good enough, this one was personally signed by Petty in 2005."

Gold decals with Petty's signature can be found on the doors and tailgate, and this truck also features carpeted cargo bed sides with a rubber cargo floor insert."

Pictures show both Richard and Kyle Petty posing with the truck back in 2005 during an event where Petty signed the glove box. Under the hood, this Dodge Ram has the 5.2-liter V8, and despite the truck having almost 140,000 miles, it shows really well in pictures even when it comes to the undercarriage."
