<p>Hardcore Honda enthusiasts should instantly recognize this <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0177-1972-honda-z600-coupe/820421?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1972 Honda Z600 Coupe</a>, which along with the N600 was the first Honda sold in the United States. While small, the fuel savings this kei car provided was mighty for its time, and since the oil crisis was in full swing many consumers flocked to Honda for relief at the pump. There was the added bonus of this car being extremely affordable, making them popular with people just getting a start in life. Today finding one today isn’t exactly easy, but this well-sorted example is being offered to the public at no reserve through <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">RM Sotheby’s</a>.</p>

<p>Making a big impression with a nice bright orange exterior over black interior, this little Honda will surely impress. Thanks to a high-quality restoration which concentrated on details, this is the kind of ride that’s worthy of taking to shows, classic cruises, and anywhere else. It’s the kind of car that brings back memories for those who see it, especially since they might not have been in the presence of a Z600 in a long time.</p>

<p>Powering this kei car is a 598cc SOHC two-cylinder air-cooled engine. Thanks to a snappy four-speed manual transmission and power brakes, combined with its miniscule curb weight, driving this Honda is incredibly entertaining.</p>
