It was the first big step away from the original roadster design and it gave America’s sports car many attributes that defined much of the thought process that went into most of the following generations. If you really think about it, what was referred to as the mid-years kind of defined the Corvette into current times. 1963 was the first year for the hidden headlights, a design that hadn’t been used since 1942 and would continue on the Corvette until 2004. Likewise, the first discussion of a mid-mount engine design first came up when laying out the second generation. Ultimately this didn’t happen until 2020 but "
