After you set up your defenses, waves of enemies will come in and attempt to take down your HYPER-COREs and after each wave, you go back to rebuilding your defenses.

The game allows you to hold two weapons at a time which you can either find around the map, in the toy packaging you spawn in on the map or as a random prize from the slot machine found on each map. Most maps start you off with an assault rifle which, while serviceable, has a lot of recoil, making it difficult to shoot accurately. HYPERCHARGE also doesn’t have iron sights; you can zoom in to get a more accurate shot but it doesn’t centre the gun to the screen or zoom into the scope like most modern FPS games do. Imagine my surprise when I found a sniper rifle and all it did was zoom in the camera a little bit more...kinda disappointing, if you ask me. I will say though, the shotgun is the most satisfying gun I’ve used in quite a while - shooting it feels like God slamming a car door.",

You can unlock new playable figures, skins, heads and weapon colours by reaching certain ranks on each level but the most important unlockables are new levels and buildable defences. As much as I love being able to work towards unlocking things, this system can become very annoying very quickly. How it works is dependent on how well you do in a level; you will get a ranking (usually silver to gold to platinum, etc.) and getting a certain amount of a particular rank will unlock something. For example, three gold ranks will unlock a new buildable or four platinum ranks will unlock a new level. The thing is, each difficulty has its own ranking system, e.g. normal gives you Gold and Platinum ranks while hard will give you Emerald and Ruby ranks. So what ends up happening is you’ll get pretty far through one difficulty and start encountering new enemies that require specific buildables to exploit their weaknesses (i.e an anti-air cannon for flying enemies), only to find out you can only unlock the thing you need by going on a higher difficulty and starting again. This constant switching of difficulties can be quite jarring to some and could gate-keep progress from lesser skilled players. Personally, I could forgive this if these difficulty-based unlockables actually scaled downward, but going on a harder difficulty and getting two Emerald ranks and one Ruby rank and having that not unlock the needed buildables for lower difficulties where I’d only need Gold or Platinum rankings seems like a glaring design flaw.",
