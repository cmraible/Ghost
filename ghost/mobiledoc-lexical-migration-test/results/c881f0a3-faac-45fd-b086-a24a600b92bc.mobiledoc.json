Those fenders, along with the hood, bumpers, front splitter and more, are created from carbon fiber, while the taillights, door handles and fuel cap are a custom billet. Even the Mustang logo in the front grille has a brushed finish with a carbon fiber background. Inside, the car is fitted with a European-inspired leather interior crafted by Gabe’s Custom Interiors, and it has the latest audio system with Bluetooth and iPod connectivity."
