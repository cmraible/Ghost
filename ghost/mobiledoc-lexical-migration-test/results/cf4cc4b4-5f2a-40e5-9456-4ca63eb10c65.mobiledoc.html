<p>On our latest weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a><em>, </em>David Sirota was joined by <em>New York Times</em>’ global economy correspondent <a href="https://twitter.com/petersgoodman">Peter S. Goodman</a> to get to the bottom of the ongoing inflation crisis — and to determine who is to blame.  They also took questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>

<p>We had listeners call in to give us their on-air take about some big questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are the supply chains still disrupted?</li>
    <li>Do working class people have too much money right now?</li>
    <li>How much corporate profiteering is too much?</li>
</ul>
