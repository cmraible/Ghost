Suck Bang Blow, a popular Murrels Inlet biker bar, faced the possible revocation of its alcohol licenses after the South Carolina Department of Revenue went after it for alleged violations of the governor’s executive order prohibiting concert venues and nightclubs from being open in July of 2020. The bar advertised it was hosting several free live concerts during the week of the rally. Reportedly, the bar didn’t limit attendance or do anything else to comply with the governor’s Executive Orders. Thankfully, Suck Bang Blow and the state settled out of court last month and the bar’s alcohol licenses haven’t been revoked."

In fact, Atlantic Beach police clerk Kim Mujas told the media, “We don’t want them here.” That’s pretty clear-cut, even though in years past the city has been very welcoming to bikers and their dollars. However, as mentioned before, the city has officially canceled its Bikefest, known as Black Bike Week, two years in a row, making it clear that keeping the city COVID-19 safe is more of a priority. However, Mujas did also say, “We hope by next year we can open up full swing, but not this year.” The song and dance about there’s always next year has been going on for over a year now, and it appears some haven’t tired of it yet."
