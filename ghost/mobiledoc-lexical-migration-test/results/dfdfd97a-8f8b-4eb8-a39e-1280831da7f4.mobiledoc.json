To be clear, this type of remote should have its own design – it shouldn't look or feel like an iPhone. If that could be a product Apple is working on, the question becomes: do they offer it as part of the Apple TV (or a special line of it) or do they just sell it as an add-on product? If they were sell it as an add-on, it likely wouldn't be cheap. I could see Apple charging between $150 and $250 for a product like that. "
