<hr>
<p>The Suburban is one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorious-dream-car-picks-classic-offroaders/">original sport utility vehicles</a>. It was built to haul lots of people – and their stuff – across <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-raptor-with-tracks/">difficult terrain</a>. Now that SUVs are more popular than ever, it's easy to understand why <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-finds-santa-in-1968-photos/">the classics</a> are so in demand.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/181072/1966-gmc-suburban">this 1966 Suburban</a> that we found right here on Motorious. It was recently subjected to a "no expense spared" restoration, and is likely one of the nicest early Suburbans in the world at this point.</p>

<p>1966 marked the final year for the panel truck body style seen here. As early Suburbans go, it's the rarest of the rare.</p>
<p>According to the ad, it was restored in 2006 at a cost of $50,000. In 2015, it was repainted in Stealth Blue, which added another $15,000 to the receipt folder. In our opinion, the modern steely metallic blue color goes well with the equally modern five spoke steel wheels.</p>

<p>There's also a custom modern interior, making the interior of this classic SUV a more pleasant place to spend time. All of the modern conveniences are here – comfortable power seats, air conditioning, and a great stereo. Who wants to go on a road trip?</p>
<p>Under the hood, you'll find a 454 cubic inch big block V8 fed by a four barrel carburetor on an aftermarket aluminum intake manifold. It's got plenty of power to move this machine around and then some.</p>

<p>Three-pedal fans rejoice: there's a five speed manual transmission behind that massive V8. This thing should be an absolute riot to drive.</p>
