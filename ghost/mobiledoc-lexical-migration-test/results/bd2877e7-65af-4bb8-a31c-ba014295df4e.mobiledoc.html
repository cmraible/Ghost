<p>Once slathered in gray, this car featured a few different colors. From gray, the car was then partially finished in red, and then was given the black hue that it sports now from back in 2015 after bodywork was performed by RDB LA of Los Angeles. Exterior-wise, the car features widened steel fenders with carbon fiber wheel flares, and has been fitted with a Saleen lower front air dam. We must disclose that there are a few chips in the paint and windshield. A set of 18-inch HRE wheels on all four corners. </p>
