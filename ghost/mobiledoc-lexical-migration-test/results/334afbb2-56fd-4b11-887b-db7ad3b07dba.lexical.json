            "text": "Here’s another tidbit of Porsche history. Max Hoffman, who worked for Porsche in the 50s, wanted to create a model to compete with other popular purpose-built cars at the time, like offerings from MG, Austin-Healey, and Triumph. Essentially, he was looking for something that was fast, without being too frou-frou. The Speedster was born, which ended up being one of the most beautiful models Porsche ever made, while also being incredible to drive. The T2 model, a.k.a. the kind offered here, is among  the best within the Speedster category. It has undergone a crazy-good restoration to enhance the car’s performance while retaining its factory-original appearance. It has a rare factory color and a powerful, upgraded engine. It’s a real stunner and a real Speedster all in one.",

It was the last of 10 examples ever built, with a very extensive racing history in the 70s– it earned top 10 finishes at Sears Point and Pocono, as well as 3rd Place at the Daytona Finale. This model has a whole lot of swag. In 1978, this 934/5 was updated with 935 style-bodywork, before being stripped down right after. Finally, it was meticulously and completely restored to its proper 1977 specification, as well as the Desperado Racing Livery. It has been built and restored by true Porsche specialists, granting it the highest levels of historic competition, while also making it a rare and beautiful bird. Porsche lovers, there’s more where this came from. You can peruse the ",
