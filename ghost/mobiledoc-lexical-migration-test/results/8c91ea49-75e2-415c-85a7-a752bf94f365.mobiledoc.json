As the entry level car for the brand, the Comet was looked down upon by many, an attitude which persists to one extent or another today. For that reason alone, a lot of enthusiasts would pass this ’73 up, especially given its condition. However, RevStoration isn’t like most enthusiasts, so we get to see them bring this little thing back to life."

Their property is littered with old family cars and acquisitions, which we’ve seen them miraculously get running again. After doing that so many times, they want a real challenge. That’s where the 1973 Mercury Comet GT comes in."

Lest you think the whole scene is staged, there are small trees growing aroound every side of the Comet, so it they would’ve had to drop it in using a crane or helicopter."

However, this was the father’s car when he was dating the mother, so there’s some sentimental value wrapped up in it. Plus, it’s a challenge for them to get it running. It of course comes with some curve balls, but they do finally get the ol’ girl running."
