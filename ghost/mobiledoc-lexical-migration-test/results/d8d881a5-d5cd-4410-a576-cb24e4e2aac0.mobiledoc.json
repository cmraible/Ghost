I’m getting about an extra day’s worth of traffic a week from Apple News (you can [sub to *One Man & His Blog* there](https://apple.news/T3_0JneE7SBW19YcSBnw97g), should you wish.)\n2. My wife – a Facebook refusenik – now uses Apple News as her major news-reading interface.\n\nSomething’s happening here.\n\n\n## The Need for Notifications\n\nAnother interesting point in the piece:\n\n> “The main growth has been driven by the iOS10 update and a combination of our new strategy,” said Bridge. Several publishers recorded traffic increases since the iOS10 update last year, partly because of the introduction of notifications. “In the modern age, people look to consume content through notifications. That doesn’t mean they will always open them and click through.”\n\nFor breaking news – you need to have a notification strategy, but one that doesn’t get your notifications switched off.\n\n\n"
