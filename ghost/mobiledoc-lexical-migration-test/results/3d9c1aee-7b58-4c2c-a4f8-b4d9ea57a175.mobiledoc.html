<p>On paper, the Biden administration has delivered several successes in its first year. Even though they’ve all been watered down by corporate meddling, the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the potential Build Back Better framework all promise significant government investment in progressive priorities, from an expanded social safety net to much-needed climate action. President Joe Biden also pulled the country out of the Afghanistan quagmire and has significantly cut back military drone strikes. So why does it feel like the Biden presidency is such a colossal failure?</p>
<p>In this week’s Weekend Reader, we highlight a thoughtful <em>New York Times</em> opinion column that suggests an answer: Biden’s efforts are nowhere near as ambitious as they need to be to address our mounting crises — and the power structures put in place by Republicans and big business might not let Biden do any better.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/opinion/joe-biden-political-time.html"><strong>Why the Biden Presidency Feels Like Such a Disappointment</strong></a><strong></strong></strong>(The New York Times) <em>— “There is a sense that however large his spending bills may be, they come nowhere near to solving the problems they are meant to address. There is also a sense that however much in control of the federal government progressives may be, the right is still calling the shots. The first point is inarguable, especially when it comes to climate change and inequality. The second point is questionable, but it can find confirmation in everything from a conservative Supreme Court supermajority to the right’s ability to unleash one debilitating culture war after another — and in the growing fear that Republicans will ride back into the halls of power and slam the doors of democracy behind them, maybe forever.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/"><strong>Trump’s Next Coup Has Already Begun</strong></a> (The Atlantic) <em>— “The prospect of this democratic collapse is not remote. People with the motive to make it happen are manufacturing the means. Given the opportunity, they will act. They are acting already. Who or what will safeguard our constitutional order is not apparent today. It is not even apparent who will try. Democrats, big and small D, are not behaving as if they believe the threat is real. Some of them, including President Joe Biden, have taken passing rhetorical notice, but their attention wanders. They are making a grievous mistake.”</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/the-millions-of-tons-of-carbon-emissions-that-dont-officially-exist"><strong>The Millions of Tons of Carbon Emissions That Don’t Officially Exist</strong></a><strong></strong></strong>(The New Yorker) <em>— “By 2019, biomass accounted for about fifty-nine per cent of all renewable-energy use in the E.U. The Dogwood Alliance estimates that sixty thousand acres of trees — trees that would have otherwise sequestered carbon — are burned each year to supply the growing pellet market. Global demand for wood pellets is expected to double by 2027, to more than thirty-six million tons. And although the entire premise of burning wood as renewable energy hinges on the assumption that trees grow back, there is no binding governmental or industrial oversight for replanting trees at all. ‘There’s no requirement that Drax or anyone has to replant trees, and no requirement that whatever they’re planting has to come back as natural forest,’ Quaranda said."</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eliot-higgins-syria_n_4269417?1384795474=">Inside The One-Man Intelligence Unit That Exposed The Secrets And Atrocities Of Syria's War</a> (HuffPost News) <em>— “On paper, Higgins — a 34-year-old with a 2-year-old daughter — brought no credentials for the job. He had no formal intelligence training or security clearance that gave him access to classified documents. He could not speak or read Arabic. He had never set foot in the Middle East, unless you count the time he changed planes in Dubai en route to Manila, or his trip to visit his in-laws in Turkey. Yet in the 18 months since Higgins had begun blogging about Syria, his barebones site, Brown Moses, had become the foremost source of information on the weapons used in Syria's deadly war. Using nothing more sophisticated than an Asus laptop, he had uncovered evidence of weapons imported into Syria from Iran. He had been the first person to identify widely-banned cluster bombs deployed by Syrian forces. By</em> The New York Times' <em>own admission, his findings had offered a key tip that helped the newspaper prove that Saudi Arabia had funneled arms to opposition fighters in Syria.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164408/young-intellectuals-illiberal-revolution-conservatism"><strong>The Radical Young Intellectuals Who Want to Take Over the American Right</strong></a> (New Republic) <em>— “Hochman is a rising a star of what is being called, rather unimaginatively, the New Right. He and his comrades are populist culture warriors, cohered as much by temperament as ideology—and by certain fiercely held enmities. Some are ‘national conservatives,’ who, like ‘Reformicons’ of the 2010s, support pro-family welfare policy and reject the GOP’s tax-cutting orthodoxy. (NatCons, as they’re known, also tend to be China and immigration hawks who want an “industrial policy” for the heartland.) Others are “postliberal” localists, in the vein of Patrick Deneen, who wrote </em>Why Liberalism Failed<em>, and Rod Dreher, the irascible Eastern Orthodox blogger and author of </em>The Benedict Option<em>, a spirited argument for Christian retreat from the turpitude of public life into virtuous communal separatism. And others are Roman Catholic integralists, aspiring to a theologically ordered politics; Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule and University of Dallas politics professor and </em>American Affairs<em> editor Gladden Pappin are their touchstones.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theracket.documented.net/p/exxon-is-still-denying-climate-scienceincluding"><strong>Exxon Is Still Denying Climate Science — Including Its Own</strong></a> (Documented and HEATED) <em>— “Last month, the Washington Post obtained a recording of top Exxon lobbyist Erik Oswald telling a gathering of industry peers that he doesn’t believe climate change poses ‘catastrophic, inevitable risk.’ But Exxon’s own internal documents from the 1970s and 1980s acknowledge that climate change poses catastrophic risks, and climate scientists say catastrophic risks are inevitable if humans don’t rapidly transition away from fossil fuels, a joint investigation from </em>HEATED<em> and </em>Documented<em> has found.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2021/12/08/national-champions-movie-review-college-athletes/6430939001/"><strong>‘National Champions’ Shows Us What A College Athlete Boycott Might Look Like</strong></a> (USA Today) <em>— “The notion of college athletes potentially protesting a championship football or Final Four basketball game has been around since at least 1991 when UNLV was rumored to be considering a boycott if it made the championship game (a loss to Duke in the semifinals made the point moot). The possibility still pops up now and then in various forms, prompting a series of questions about how the movement would take hold within a team and what the NCAA would do in reaction. To this point, nobody’s tested the theory in real life.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-europe/the-uncertain-fate-of-an-alpine-mountain-lodge"><strong>The Uncertain Fate of an Alpine Mountain Lodge</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “In total, the Italian border with Switzerland and Austria has now moved in more than a hundred places, according to reports from I.G.M. In the first year of the agreement, a ski-lift landing situated in Italy suddenly found itself on Swiss soil. Subsequent land shifts have consisted of uninhabited terrain, scattered plots of rock and scree about a few hundred feet long. The moving border has not run into any people or commerce, with one exception: the Rifugio Guide del Cervino, a traditional mountain lodge in the Pennine Alps. It’s situated on the edge of the Testa Grigia peak, atop a cliff that drops off toward Italy and descends into Switzerland on the other side. The building itself may be located in Italy, Switzerland, or both.”</em></li>
