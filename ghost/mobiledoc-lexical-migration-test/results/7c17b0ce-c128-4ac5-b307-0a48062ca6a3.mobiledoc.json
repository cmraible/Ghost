The new Euro 7 standards seek to dramatically drop the amount of pollutants exiting the tailpipes of vehicles across the continent, especially nitrogen oxides. Some have framed the battle as a crusade for public health, but others portray it as a vital step to stop the oceans from consuming land masses as the planet’s temperature inches up faster."

          "Another point of contention these transport ministers discussed was the 2035 deadline to phase out any vehicle which directly emits CO2, famously known as the ICE ban or EV mandate. It’s a move California and other places have made as well with government officials proclaiming that if it’s law, automakers will find a way to manufacture electric cars to be more economical. Again, the problem is not everyone is convinced such mandates are practical, with many pointing out poorer individuals would be squeezed the hardest."
