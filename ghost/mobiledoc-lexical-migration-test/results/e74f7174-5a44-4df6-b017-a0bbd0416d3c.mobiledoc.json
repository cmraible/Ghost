Thankfully, after a few short steps into the first stage, we’re introduced to the first of many interesting mechanics that Youropa will explore in the form of a golden paint can. This acts like a checkpoint system that allows you to paint directly onto your character’s face and body, creating your very own individual with a splash of your own creativity - you can make anything your imagination can come up with.
