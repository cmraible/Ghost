While the debate among fans of the different Big Three brands can get intense, there’s still a lot of banter between American muscle car enthusiasts and those who prefer the European flavor of performance. To help settle at least part of that debate, Throttle House decided to put a Dodge Demon and 2019 BMW M5 Competition through several performance tests. With such a supposedly objective approach the idea is it would be easy to determine which is the better car.",
