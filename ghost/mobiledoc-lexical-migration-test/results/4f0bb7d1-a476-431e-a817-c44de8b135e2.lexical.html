<p>A new era brought ever progressing enemy combatants to the front lines. What had been working for the mighty U.S. military was not so relevant anymore. One of the major changes badly needed by our troops was a better way of getting around the harsh terrains of the modern battlefield than the outdated jeeps of the past and in 1985 that need was met in the form of an AM General designed <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/5202-cha/1987-am-general-m998-hmmwv-humvee?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">M998 Humvee</a>.</p>

<p>Before awarding AM General with a contract to outfit the U.S. Armed Forces with Humvees, the M998 was put through rigorous testing. 600,000 miles of off-road torture in desert and arctic conditions was not a problem for the new revolutionary truck, cementing the Humvees place in Military and off-road history.</p>

<p>The nostalgia surrounding the Humvee came almost immediately, catching the eye of every off-road enthusiast with or without a military background. Unfortunately, the M998 was not available in street legal form until 1992 and even then it was not a true M998. The first true M998 was not sold publicly until 2014 and was strictly for off-road use only making it difficult to tag. Even with registration issues pending 25 former military use vehicles sold on December 17th, 2014 at an average of $30,000 each.</p>
