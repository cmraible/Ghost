<p>Over 9 days, the 2023 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction was yet again held, bringing in huge crowds as hundreds of lots <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-corvette-zl-1-auctions/">crossed the auction block</a>. Many highlights made for another memorable year of Arizonaâ€™s largest car auction.</p>
<p><strong>Check out the classic Corvette that recently auctioned for $3.14 million <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1969-corvette-zl-1-auctions/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>The top slot in the auction went to a gray <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/">Ferrari F40</a> which hammered at $2.75 million on Saturday, January 28. Other lots which exceeded the million dollar mark included a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT at $1,595,000 and a 2019 Ford GT at $1,320,000.</p>

<p>Another big ticket item was a 1966 Shelby Group II Mustang built for Ken Miles, which hammered at $770,000. Two other cars matched that price, a 1967 Chevy Corvette custom convertible and a 1969 Camaro ZL1. Not too far behind at a hammer price of $748,000 was a 2012 Lexus LFA, showing the Japanese supercar is aging rather well with time.</p>
<p>Plenty of attention was yet again focused on the charitable auctions. In particular, the first build slot for the 2024 Ford Mustang GT really grabbed the spotlight, netting $490,000 as it crossed the block on the night of January 28. Additional charitable contributions brought in $565,000 for research into type 1 diabetes.</p>

<p>As for the first production 2024 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1, that went for a cool $500,000 as several parties bid fast and furious for it. Fund from that sale went to Tread Lightly, a non-profit dedicated to responsible off-roading practices.</p>
<p>A 1969 Pontiac Firebird was named Ultimate Best in Show for the 2023 Barrett-Jackson Cup competition. Built by Troy Gudgel of BBT Fabrications, it hits hard with a 482 twin-turbo Butler Performance Pontiac crate engine and T56 6-speed transmission. There are plenty of interesting details about the car, but the most unique is that even though it was made to work as a street car it can also be used in land-speed racing. Currently, the Firebird is a class record holder for ECTA standing mile at 199.027 mph.</p>
