Well, prepare to have such shortsighted comments shutdown by this seriously potent pony car. This 2018 Ford Mustang Petty’s Garage King Edition packs some power, all while its occupants enjoy the sunshine."

          ", this Mustang immediately makes a statement with its meshed grille and trunk spoiler detailing the GT profile. The deep shade of red that envelops this model is accompanied by contrasting black decals and HRE FlowForm alloy wheels for a truly devilish appearance. Combine all of that with the 2018 Mustang’s hood vents and raked headlights, and you’ve got a great looking convertible. Roof up or down, this Mustang means business."

Swapping cogs comes curtesy of a 10-speed automatic transmission. A new Cold Air Kit, Magnaflow catback exhaust, additional bracing, coil-over suspension, and some sticky tires all serve to boost overall performance."

These enhancements aren’t too overbearing like those found on some modified Mustangs, meaning that the car’s day-to-day usability hasn’t been compromised. Other luxuries fitted include cruise control, rear parking camera, heated seats, and satellite radio."
