<p>There’s a lot to love about how this Corvette looks. It’s the final year Chevrolet made the C3 with chrome bumpers, so if you’re a fan of that subtle detail, this is a good one to grab. The Classic White paint looks excellent, but it’s not the original Sunflower Yellow applied in the factory. Still, the repaint was obviously professionally done and isn’t showing signs of wearing out. It pairs excellently with the black interior, something which is very important with convertibles.</p>
<p>Pop that long, curvaceous hood and you’ll find a numbers-matching 350ci V8 with an Edelbrock 4bbl carb mounted. A dress-up kit makes everything look quite presentable. Thanks to a rebuild in the 1990s and the installation of high-performance heads in 1999 this engine runs strong. The stainless steel exhaust and Magnaflow mufflers made custom for this car in 2010 provide the right kind of burble. Topping all that off is a nice 4-speed manual transmission, perfect for a fun sports car.</p>
<p>You might not suspect it without trying the car, but this is a comfortable vehicle for taking out on the open road. Both bucket seats feature newer leather upholstery, matching the leather center console. Factory air conditioning is nice for the summer. Free of any damage and working correctly, the convertible top provides coverage in the event of inclement weather. Even the plastic rear window is free of distortion, so you’re not struggling to see what’s going on behind while driving. A period-correct Pioneer Supertuner AM/FM cassette player adds to the nostalgic charm.</p>
<p>If you do decide to get this Corvette, it comes with services receipts dating back into the 1990s. The current owner is driving it weekly, a testament to its excellent operating condition.</p>
