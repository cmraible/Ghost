R33s have just crossed the 25-year threshold that allows vehicles of that age or older to be imported regardless if they are to FMVSS standards.

Being a Japanese import, the car is right-hand drive and has instrumentation that reads in kilometers, with the odometer currently reading 81,000km or around 50,000 miles."

That performance is sent to the rear wheels via a 5-speed manual transmission, allowing for a 0-60 sprint in around 6-seconds. While not a coveted GT-R model, this Type M certainly has enough punch to be entertaining."

          "The advert states that this car \"shares a lot of parts with the 1993 240SX and 1993 300ZX and is one of the easier to maintain Skylines in the United States.\" A recent service saw the spark plugs, fuel filter, and oil changed, with a timing belt service occurring 12,000 miles ago. An interesting perk that this car currently has is a valid ‘Shaken’ test certificate, meaning that it’s still legal to drive in its homeland until June 2019. Shaken is the notoriously difficult to pass safety inspection all road cars must undergo in Japan."
