<p>This truck was built by hand and is completely made of steel, not fiberglass or anything else which won’t hold up as well. It has that iconic look everyone recognizes, and from a distance would fool people into thinking this is a regular semi-truck, until it gets closer.</p>
<p>The cab has quite a few cool features, like air windows, air horn, air brakes, and air seats. It’s a sleeper cab with a bed behind the front bucket seats, in case you want to spend the night in this or just need a quick snooze.</p>
<p>A matching Featherlite trailer car trailer matches the cab perfectly. It’s also loaded with air conditioning, propane, a roll-up side awning, bathroom, sink, cabinets, and closet.  A steel countertop has a bench vice bolted up, perfect for keeping your toys running smoothly while you’re out and about. An onboard generator means you can keep the lights and everything else running for quite some time.</p>
<p>Under the hood is a turbocharged 3208 Caterpillar diesel engine. Bolted up to that is a tough Fuller Road Ranger 10-speed transmission with overdrive. That’s the perfect setup for pulling your toys and gear to the track or anywhere else you need to be.</p>
<p>According to the seller, this Betterbuilt has never been sold before, so this might be your one and only chance to make it yours.
