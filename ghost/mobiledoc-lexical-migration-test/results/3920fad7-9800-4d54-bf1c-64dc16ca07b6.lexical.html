<p>All muscle-car-era Mopars bring a lot of attention at auctions, but the 'Cuda is perhaps one of the best. While the big-block and Hemi 'Cudas are by far the most desirable, examples like this <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28703/1970-plymouth-cuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1970 Plymouth 'Cuda</a> convertible with the 340 V8 are a more cost-effective way experience the rarity of a 'Cuda without having to empty your bank account. How much this one goes for will be determined on Saturday, November 9 as it crosses the <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a> auction block.</p>

<p>Painted in the high-impact Lemon Twist Yellow color, this '70 'Cuda would stand out anywhere, but this car is even more rare being a convertible with the 340 CID V8 with a four-barrel carb and the three-speed automatic. Of the 548 'Cuda convertibles produced in 1970, only 155 were said to have come from the factory with this combination. This 275 horsepower engine had the lowest rating of the available 'Cuda engines, and that's also why this model is more affordable. At the end of the day, it's still rare, it's still a 'Cuda and it's still convertible.</p>
<p>The 'Cuda, of course, was the sportiest offering of the Barracuda lineup, and it is distinguishable by the "BS" to start the VIN. In 1970, Plymouth produced almost many 'Cuda coupes as it did the standard Barracuda coupes, but the convertible versions of the 'Cuda and Barracuda Gran Coupe were produced in very low numbers.</p>

<p>What really makes the 1970 Barracuda lineup so special is that it was intended as Plymouth's economy car of that time. Thanks to cool styling, low production and the availability of some high-output engine options, these Barracudas are some of the coolest cars to emerge from the early 1970s.</p>
