After all, he collected $4.2 million from the insurance company after investigators couldn’t prove he was involved. In fact, a woman who wasn’t identified claimed to know it was an inside job since the owner owed millions to a bank that was foreclosing on one of his properties. His warehouses in New Jersey were searched, but the car didn’t turn up. Pugliese scoffed at the claims, saying he could’ve simply sold it if he needed the money. At the same time he admitted that after trying to arrange for its sale earlier he realized a deep connection to the DB5 and couldn’t part with it.",
