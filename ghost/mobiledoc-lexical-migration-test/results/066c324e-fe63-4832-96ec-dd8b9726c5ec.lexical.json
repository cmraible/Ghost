            "text": "Also interesting, if Tom Cotter looks a little different it’s for good reason. This is the first episode of Barn Find Hunter that’s been filmed in a year, which is crazy to think about. We’ve been living off outtakes from other episodes and other filler content, so finally we’re getting fresh videos from Tom and crew. That does mean we get to hear a muffled Tom as he wears a mask, even though this Steve guy doesn’t. However, this episode is a hell of a way to kick things off again, so let’s hope it sets the right tone for a tremendous season of Barn Find Hunter which hopefully will include even more motorcycles (Tom sounds like he got the hint).",
