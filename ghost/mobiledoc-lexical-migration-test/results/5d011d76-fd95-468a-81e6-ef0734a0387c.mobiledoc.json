          ", then you’ll know that it’s not exactly the kind of movie that strikes you as having enough money to throw away four Ferraris. That’s exactly why they used replicas, fiberglass bodies that used Ford V8 under the hood. Regardless of if they were “real Ferraris “these cars became icons of their time And pretty much symbolic of fun loving youth. Nowadays, one of the four replicas used in that movie has come on to the market and you might not wanna miss this one."

          " Ferrari replica has already been sold, however it really is the price tag that makes the story interesting. In total, that car was sold for US$313,000. It might seem kind of obvious that a car from such a spectacular film would have been more than capable of raking in the big bucks. However, it’s not exactly like it was built by the real Italian brand themselves. Rather, it struck some as odd but in a cool way that, despite not being a true Ferrari, it still fetched super car numbers."

In case you weren’t counting, that’s about 57 times the value of the Ferris Bueller go car. Fans of Ferrari might point out the obvious and say that the 250 was given that value mostly because of its nameplate and true to form design, well Ferris Bueller lovers might try and contradict that. However, this is not a question of if it was a justified purchase but rather just pointing out the irony that its replica model was purchased for an unfathomably lower price than the original."
