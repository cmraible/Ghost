Thank you to the Park Center for Independent Media for recognizing our reporting and what we are working to build.</p><p>I‚Äôve worked as a journalist for the past nine years, mostly at smaller news outlets. Like most of my colleagues, I have been laid off a few times, but I‚Äôve managed to mostly stay employed by developing a beat covering money and influence.</p><p>I‚Äôve been fortunate to work for organizations that allowed and encouraged me to report stories challenging power, corporate interests, and both political parties, which is our mission every day now at <em>The Lever</em>.</p><p>I got to work with <em>Lever</em> founder and 2015 Izzy award winner David Sirota several years ago at <em>International Business Times</em>. And I was the first person to join David in 2020 when he started writing the newsletter that would become <em>The Lever</em>.</p><p>The Park Center for Media has spotlighted <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs reporting on ‚Äúdark money influence on the Supreme Court.‚Äù</p><p>In 2017, when I was a reporter at a campaign finance watchdog group, one of my colleagues let me in on the world of Leonard Leo, an executive at the Federalist Society, and his dark money network, known as the Judicial Crisis Network.</p><p>Soon after, I went to the Federalist Society‚Äôs annual lawyers convention in Washington ‚Äî and between sessions, I pressed one of Leo‚Äôs acolytes for their dark money group‚Äôs new tax return. She was so annoyed she went home and blocked me on Twitter.</p><p>But they had to give me this file ‚Äî and what it showed astounded me. Leo‚Äôs operation had raised more than $30 million in 2016, including $28.5 million from one anonymous donor. That year, Leo‚Äôs network led a PR campaign supporting Senate Republicans who refused to hold a vote on Barack Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.</p><p>Now, Leo was serving as Donald Trump‚Äôs judicial adviser and helping Trump select Supreme Court nominees. At the same time, his dark money network was helping boost those justices‚Äô confirmation campaigns with TV ads and donations ‚Äî and lobbying the Supreme Court to issue ultra-conservative decisions and take up cases designed to smash precedents.</p><p>He was building a permanent conservative judiciary, using a seemingly endless pool of secret money, and receiving almost no public scrutiny.</p><p>I wasn‚Äôt alone in covering Leo‚Äôs dark money operation, but it would be years before he became a household name.</p><p>People know Leonard Leo now because he and his network built the Supreme Court‚Äôs 6-3 conservative supermajority, which last year overturned federal protections for abortion rights, &nbsp;invalidated gun control laws, and gutted environmental regulations.</p><p>Leo and his network accomplished all this while successfully hiding their donors. The public had no idea who was funding these efforts.</p><p>Last year, our team at <em>The Lever</em> worked with <em>ProPublica</em> to expose the first-known donor to Leo‚Äôs network ‚Äî the relatively unknown Chicago billionaire Barre Seid, who effectively converted his electronics empire into a $1.6 billion donation to a trust run by Leonard Leo.</p><p>Seid donated his company to the Marble Freedom Trust, led by Leo, which then sold the company for $1.6 billion. If Seid had sold the company, he would have owed $400 million in taxes. Instead, there were no taxes on the sale ‚Äî creating, in effect, a giant public subsidy for this conservative advocacy project.</p><p>There was no record that the trust even existed, because trusts do not have to publicly register anywhere. This transfer was the biggest known dark money donation in U.S. history.</p><p>We were able to expose one of the most consequential stories in American politics because small, adversarial news outlets like <em>The Lever</em> continue to chase stories about dark money and corruption in our political and judicial systems.</p><p>I‚Äôve been proud to find there is an audience hungry for this coverage. We have seen it at <em>The Lever</em>, where we have managed to build a small, subscriber-funded newsroom that regularly punches well above its weight.</p><p>With support from readers, we are competing with some of the biggest outlets in media ‚Äî and we are doing so without compromising. We are reporting the news how we believe it should be covered.</p><p>In giving us the Izzy award, the Park Center for Independent Media wrote: ‚ÄúNo news outlet is as thorough and relentless as <em>The Lever</em> in exposing the corrupting influence of corporate power on government and both major parties.‚Äù</p><p>That is far too kind ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also exactly what we are aspiring to be every day. Thank you for reading and recognizing <em>The Lever</em>, and thank you for letting me speak here today.</p>"
