So there‚Äôs a number of folks in the party who were with us in the beginning, to be very clear. I believe I have more elected officials supporting me than all of the candidates combined in the primary. So even as we came out of the primary to the general, there were a few holdouts. There are a few folks who were never going to support me for what their personal reasons are, but the mass majority truly are and truly have been in the trenches with us and fighting."
