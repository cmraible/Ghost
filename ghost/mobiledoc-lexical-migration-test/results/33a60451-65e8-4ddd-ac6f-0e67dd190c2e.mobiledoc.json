Those same courts had also empowered a class of unelected bureaucrats dubbed the ‚Äúadministrative state‚Äù to impose needless regulations and to endow the federal government with too much power. Like his close friend Justice Antonin Scalia, Leo argued for an originalist view of the Constitution ‚Äî namely, that the country‚Äôs founding document should be interpreted strictly based on how its 18th century authors understood its words at the time."
