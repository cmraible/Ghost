Of course, the incredibly rare car was being sold to gain a whopping $125,000. Rick, the showâ€™s star, stated many times that he loved the car with the seller even pointing out that Carroll Shelby himself signed the dash. However, he was unwilling to produce the $125,000 and offered up a lower price of $100,000. Paul, the seller, finally surrendered this beautiful car for the agreed-upon $100,000 price."

It is quite clear that Rick was infatuated with his new prized car, and this vehicle will live forever as one of the coolest finds ever captured on Pawn Stars. This is an incredible piece for the Pawn Stars to add to their vast collection of antique classic cars and vintage products."
