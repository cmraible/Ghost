It was also painted orange and black apparently to honor the state of Oklahoma. Nelson lost the car back in 1990 when the IRS seized it and most everything else he owned. It’s been floating around in the collector market, recently appearing in a Vicari Auction event."

Just the exterior of the tour bus is a work of art, from the bald eagle soaring across a blue sky on the rear to the cowboy murals on the sides. Covering the dash is tufted leather, while the rest of the interior features red velvet, dark wood, brass light fixtures, and stained glass. Honestly, it’s more like a pub than a bus, so the man really traveled in style. The bus is no longer owned by Nelson, with the last appearance we know of being a Craigslist ad from 2014."
