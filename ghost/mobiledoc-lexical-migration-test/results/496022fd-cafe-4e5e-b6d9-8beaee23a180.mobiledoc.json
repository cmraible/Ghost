While the Shelby GT350 and GT500 continue to use the pre-facelifted Mustang (2015-18), the Signature Series Mustang is based on the 2020 Mustang GT with the updated design, so that's another selling point for those who like this look more. Adding to this more aggressive styling is a redesigned front grille with winglets, splitter and air ducts, a functional ram air hood and aluminum fenders with heat extractors, while side extensions, a taller rear spoiler and restyled rear bumper finish off the Shelby-specific design."
