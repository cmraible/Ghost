<p>Hey, did you realize that the words “sex” an “six” were only one letter apart? You did? In fourth grade? Well apparently Samsung hired a whole middle school for its latest ad campaign for the Galaxy S6 smartphone, which has started showing up on the sites for <a href="https://explore.t-mobile.com/samsung-next-big-thing-is-almost-here" target="_blank">T-Mobile</a> and <a href="http://www.att.com/cellphones/samsung/six.html" target="_blank">AT&T</a>.</p>
<p>Behold:</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/six-appeal-t-mobile.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-41675 aligncenter" src="__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/six-appeal-t-mobile-300x92.jpg" alt="six-appeal-t-mobile" width="300" height="92" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/02/six-appeal-t-mobile-300x92.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/02/six-appeal-t-mobile.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<p>See, “six appeal” sounds like “sex appeal,” like something is sexy, but it’s a phone.</p>
<p>We came up with some other possibilities for the next few days while we wait for Samsung to officially unveil the Galaxy S Sex – oh, wait, haha, I mean 6:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SIXUAL HEALING</li>
    <li>I’M TOO SIXY FOR THIS PHONE</li>
    <li>SIX, DRUGS, AND ROCK AND ROLL</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that <em>is</em> worthy of note: we get a really good look at this edged phone, and it seems like there’s a lot less actual functional display real estate than there was on the Galaxy Note Edge that came out late last year. We’ll know more for sure on March 1, so until then, let’s just keep on going with these great ad campaign ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SIX IN THE CITY</li>
    <li>SIX AND CANDY</li>
    <li>LET’S ENGAGE IN SIXUAL INTERCOURSE</li>
