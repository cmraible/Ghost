Punching things up further are the modern HID headlights, so you don’t struggle to see on a dark road. As you no doubt have noticed, this Chevy has been lowered for better handling, making it more of a street machine than a trail runner. Nice polished wheels and a removable top make this SUV absolutely fantastic to take to any show.",
