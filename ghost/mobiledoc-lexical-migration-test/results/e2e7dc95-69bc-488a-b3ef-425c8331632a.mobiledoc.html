<h2 id="an-exception-to-the-rule-in-chicago">An Exception To The Rule In Chicago</h2>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/rebecca/">Rebecca Burns</a></p>
<p>A $20 million war chest, the <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2023-04-05-brandon-johnson-defeats-obama-machine-chicago/">backing of the political establishment</a>, and tacit anointment from <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-paul-vallas-mayor-runoff-endorsement-20230317-n3kmsazzqfd4jchpft3ngyza3u-story.html">the corporate media</a> — when candidates enjoy all of those advantages, it’s vanishingly rare that they lose.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly what happened in Chicago on Tuesday, when former public school teacher Brandon Johnson beat <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-vallas-helped-wall-street-loot-chicagos-schools/">serial school privatizer Paul Vallas</a> in the race to become the city’s next mayor.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>The secret to Johnson’s improbable success? Even Vallas’ camp was forced to admit that, sometimes, organized people power can beat <a href="__GHOST_URL__/in-chicago-mayoral-race-plutocrats-spend-big-against-new-taxes/">heaps of plutocrat cash</a>.</p>
<p>Thousands of volunteer foot soldiers from unions and progressive groups provided “a level of dedication and passion that exceeds people being paid to do it,” Vallas backer and City Council member Brian Hopkins <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2023/4/4/23670664/chicago-mayor-election-johnson-defeats-vallas#:~:text=After%20an%20exhausting%2C%20five%2Dweek,Public%20Schools%20CEO%20Paul%20Vallas.&text=With%2099.6%25%20of%20precincts%20reporting,15%2C872%20votes%20of%20557%2C422%20cast.">told the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em></a> the morning after the election.</p>
<p>“It’s the way they want to reshape society,” said Hopkins. “They believe it’s possible. And they’re fired up.”</p>
<p>What fired up many Johnson supporters is that he’s one of their own: a member-turned-organizer for the powerhouse Chicago Teachers Union whose campaign platform crystallized a decade of demands from the city’s unions and social movements.</p>

<p>Challenges abound, but there’s <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/elections/ct-chicago-mayoral-race-fox-32-forum-20230323-bqs2kyiltncyvpb2rdngpr64rm-story.html">real reason to hope</a> the new administration will make quick work of passing some stalled progressive priorities, including funding homeless services with a “mansion tax” on the sale of luxury homes, as well as reopening public mental health clinics closed under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.</p>
<p><em>The Lever </em>doesn’t always cover local races, but Wall Street’s flagrant attempt to buy the mayor of the nation’s third-largest city — and much of the local media’s <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-paul-vallas-endorsement-mayor-chicago-20230203-eyt23pelurgmhceze5jtuqervy-story.html">fawning treatment </a>of Vallas, who <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2023/02/09/vallas-faces-questions-about-whether-he-lives-chicago-officials-launch-probe-tax-breaks">does not even reside</a> in Chicago — made the stakes of this contest crystal clear.</p>
<p>So while the private equity-owned <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/elections/ct-chicago-mayor-race-brandon-johnson-water-bills-20230401-rpqdisk74rfstkje3lrordg43i-story.html"><em>Chicago Tribune </em>zeroed in on the supposed scandal</a> of Johnson’s unpaid water bills and parking tickets, <em>Lever </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-vallas-helped-wall-street-loot-chicagos-schools/">reporter Matthew Cunningham-Cook</a> exposed the staggering financial mismanagement of Chicago Public Schools under Vallas, who helped Wall Street firms extract more than $1 billion in excess interest payments from the school system.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/in-chicago-mayoral-race-plutocrats-spend-big-against-new-taxes/">Matthew also reported</a> on the $1.6 million in campaign contributions that flowed to Vallas from executives at six financial trading firms that could be impacted by Johnson’s proposal to tax high-frequency financial trades as part of his plan to fund public services with<a href="https://apnews.com/article/chicago-mayor-election-brandon-johnson-paul-vallas-0f57a9345f66aaa2b1d3b2fbf6d7b6b5"> $800 million</a> in new taxes on corporations and financiers.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Matthew and I joined podcast producer Jared Jacang Maher for a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/analyzing-brandon-johnsons-surprise-victory-in-chicago/">special <em>Lever Time Premium </em>episode</a> breaking down the Chicago election and the lessons it holds for other cities. Among those lessons: This is no time to tack right. Johnson’s victory flies in the face of the corporate media narrative, pushed in the wake of Eric Adams’ win in New York, that even reliably Democratic voters are uniformly embracing tough-on-crime candidates and punishing progressives.</p>
<p>The stunning victory in Chicago notwithstanding, the Democratic Party seems to be willfully ignoring that lesson.</p>
<p>On Thursday, David Sirota <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-aoc-slams-bidens-rightward-lurch/">interviewed</a> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and asked about President Biden’s rightward drift on issues ranging from the recent railroad labor dispute to drilling on public lands in Alaska. Ocasio-Cortez called this a “profound miscalculation.”</p>
<p>It’s also a predictably cynical one that prioritizes the party’s donors above the constituencies that get its politicians elected.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s worth taking a moment to appreciate what just happened in Chicago, where a labor-grassroots coalition believed that a different way of doing politics was possible — and just happened to be right. <br></p>
