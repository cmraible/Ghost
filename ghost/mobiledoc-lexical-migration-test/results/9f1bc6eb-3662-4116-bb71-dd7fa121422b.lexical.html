<p>It's a one-owner 1971 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mini-muscle-cars-ford-falcon-xb-gt/">Ford Falcon</a> GTHO Phase III, unearthed as part of an estate liquidation. To many, these represent the ultimate Australian Falcons, and only 300 were built to quality the model for race use.</p>
<p>Today, fewer than 100 examples of this rare performance car are thought to exist. That's why this car, despite its numerous deviations from stock, is expected to sell for big money.</p>

<p>The 1971 Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III was originally sold with a 351 cubic inch V8. the original engine and transmission for this car are, sadly, long gone. Barring a miracle, there's little to no chance that this will ever be restored as a "numbers matching" car. From one of the photos, it appears that this car had a shaker hood scoop, possibly hinting at a big block under the hood.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that it's effectively a rolling shell at this point, numerous body modifications will further harm the value of this rare machine. Still, given the prices other Falcon GTHO Phase III cars have demanded, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/887292/barn-find-1971-ford-falcon-gtho-phase-iii-to-fetch-in-excess-of-300000/">Car Advice</a> thinks it will still fetch major dough at auction.</p>

<p>Just a few short months ago, a perfect Falcon GTHO Phase III sold for $640,000 AUD ($449,000 USD), with prices still on the upswing. With a careful restoration, this one may be worth as much as $500,000 AUD ($351,000 USD).</p>
<p>Regardless, the next owner will have a long road ahead of them. Once the restoration is complete, though, they will rest easy knowing that they've preserved an important piece of Australian muscle car history. </p>
