<hr>
<p>Most restomod builds are started as simultaneous projects that restore a classic car while adding performance and handling attributes of a modern sports car. This <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851591-1967-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Resto-Mod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1967 Chevrolet Chevelle</a> isn't your typical restomod, however, as it started as a fully restored muscle car that was probably already a show winner, but then the builder took things up a notch by modifying almost every performance aspect of this Chevelle while retaining the car's stock look. If you like what you see, this monster muscle car is up for grabs through <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Awesome Joe Auctions</a> at the Spring Carlisle auction that will start on June 21 at 7 p.m..</p>

<p>This Chevelle underwent a frame-off restoration back in 2011 built as a big-block SS clone, but that apparently wasn't good enough for this builder. In place of the big-block V8, this Chevelle is powered by a supercharged LSA V8 that started with a 6.0-liter displacement and was then bored and stroked to 408 cubic inches (almost 6.7 liters). This engine received LS3 heads, a custom camshaft and upgraded internals resulting in 597 horsepower measured at the rear wheels on a dyno. A 4L80E automatic transmission was built up to handle all that power, and a Ford nine-inch rear end with a Detroit Locker helps send all that power to the ground.</p>
<p>If not for the V-spoke wheels and four-wheel disc brakes, it would be impossible to tell this Chevelle was a built-up restomod. The Marina Blue paint job is perfectly accented with gorgeous chrome elements, and the all-blue interior looks as good as it did back in 1967. This cabin was upgraded with digital gauges and an aftermarket sound system, but the seats, center console and steering wheel are all stock.</p>
