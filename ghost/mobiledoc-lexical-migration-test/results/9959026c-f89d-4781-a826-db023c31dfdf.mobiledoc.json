This crossover event was hinted at a while ago on social media as Sean Kerr traveled from Pennsylvania to southern Utah and hung out at Matt’s shop. While he was there, he saw Ed’s vintage motorcycle, a Rokon, and decided he had to help get it running again."

That and they are incredibly capable, even when you’re dealing with an area with absolutely no trails. In fact, some areas designate Rokons as tractors."

You can tell he has many fond memories of the motorcycle and is excited to get back in the saddle. Plus, they have on hand a modern Rokon Trail-Breaker, so you can see that in action."
