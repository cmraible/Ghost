<p>Astute regular readers might have noted two things from my last post:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ghost 3.0 has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/10/ghost-3-0-has-built-in-membership-and-paywall-tools-to-build-engaged-journalism-sites/">built in memberships and subscriptions</a></li>
    <li><em>One Man & His Blog</em> runs on Ghost</li>
</ul>
<p>So, yes, one of the reasons I've been tracking this functionality in Ghost so closely is that I intend to add a subscriber element to this site in the near future - possibly even this week. </p>
<p>The OM&HB you know now will remain free, as it alway has for the last 16(!) years. But I intend to start building out (indeed, have already prepared) some members- and subscribers-only resources. When I do training and consultancy work, people often express regret that they can't keep me on, or bring me in more often. This is a way of continuing to provide the digital journalism and online publishing communities with a greater depth of practical resources and anlaysis, for a pretty low monthly price.</p>
<p>The more subscribers I get, the more time I can devote to building out both the free and paid elements of the site. I have no intention of dropping my training and consultancy work - I enjoy them too much - but an additional income stream is always welcome. And I've been hankering to practice what I preach for a few months now. So, hence my move into being a hyper-niche publisherâ€¦</p>
<p>I actually started the groundwork for this earlier in the year with the launch of a paid newsletter - <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/adders/members"><em>Engaged Reading Time</em></a>. Subscribers to that will be automatically migrated to also being paid subscribers here, at no extra cost - and paid subscribers here will also get the newsletter. </p>
<p>Yes, it's an experiment. Yes, it might fail. But I hope there are enough people out there passionate about the future of engaged, digital journalism that they'll be willing to support this resource.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates later in the week. </p>
