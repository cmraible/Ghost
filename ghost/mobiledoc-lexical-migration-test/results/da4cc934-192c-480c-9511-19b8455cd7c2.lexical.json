This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I would prefer silence over a video game noise track. My mind gets too busy thinking about the exact process which causes exhaust noises and how you can alter that with a header swap, oh but this thing doesn’t have headers, so maybe a y-pipe to replace the x-pipe…oh it doesn’t have that either.

Kuniskis assures the crowd and viewers at home that this is the electric car \"they\" don’t want you to have, and if  \"they\" means my kids when they have to be seen with me in public, I guess he’s got a point.
