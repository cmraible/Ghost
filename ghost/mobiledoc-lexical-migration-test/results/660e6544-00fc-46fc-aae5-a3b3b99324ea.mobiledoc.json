          "Rickey Jensen was the owner of RJ and C Metal Fabricators in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a quiet and private man who reportedly mostly kept to himself. He had an extensive collection of scrap metal and other junkyard items, but in the business of welding and fabricating, that collection is simply stock. Some apparently may have observed the man to be “a bit of a hoarder” which, given the historic discovery, seems like just a slight understatement."
