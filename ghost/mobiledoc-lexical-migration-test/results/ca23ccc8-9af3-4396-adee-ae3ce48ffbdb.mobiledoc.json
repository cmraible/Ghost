This exclusivity has led to the creation of a list of celebrities who, for various reasons, have been denied the privilege of owning a Ferrari straight from the factory."

Despite owning an extensive Ferrari collection and being a self-professed fan of the brand, Ramsay was famously denied a chance to purchase the hyper-exclusive LaFerrari Aperta. Ferrari's decision was based on the fact that Ramsay, known for his fiery temperament, could potentially harm the brand's image."

His turbulent past and negative media attention led Ferrari to deny him the opportunity to own their cars. Bieberâ€™s reputation for reckless driving, including a high-profile incident involving a Lamborghini, is believed to have played a crucial role in Ferrari's decision."

The renowned Canadian electronic music producer and DJ was given a cease and desist letter by Ferrari after he customized his 458 Italia, dubbed the 'Purrari,' with a Nyan Cat theme wrap. Ferrari viewed this as a defacement of their brand, leading to his ban."
