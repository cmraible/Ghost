Your attachment to what constitutes the Mustang is now irrelevant, just remember that."

I’m not complaining that changes being made to the Mustang since that’s the whole point of different generations. Some of the rumored changes for the S650 sound great and are things I have been wanting to see happen for a long time, like all-wheel drive being added. However, there’s certainly a sense of dread that Ford’s going to go in the wrong direction here, although that will make everyone’s S550 all the more valuable in the future, so there’s always a bright side."
