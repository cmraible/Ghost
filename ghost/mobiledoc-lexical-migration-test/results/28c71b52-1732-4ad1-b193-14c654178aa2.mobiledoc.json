Since the International Race of Champions series ended in 2006, it may not make sense for the IROC-Z to make a comeback. Digital artist Oscar V recreated a modern recreation of the third-generation IROC-Z. "

The rendering features four-segment headlamps, rectangular roofline, and the rear window is reshaped. Much like the original IROC, it was given a small blade rear spoiler. "

          "As you know, the IROC-Z hasn't been around for decades, but the closest version would be the modern high-performance 1LE that comes equipped with plenty of modernized parts one would find on the third-gen IROC. Stopping power comes from big Brembo brakes on all four corners, and it received a performance-tuned suspension comes with stiffer bushings, springs and stabilizer. Even more, the 1LE also features an electronic Limited-Slip differential (eLSD). Exterior-wise, the car features a front splitter and a rear spoiler. Of course, the car is clad with Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires."
