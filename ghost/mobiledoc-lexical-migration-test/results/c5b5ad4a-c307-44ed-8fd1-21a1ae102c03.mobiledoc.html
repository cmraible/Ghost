<hr>
<p>Some people try to sneak <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">JDM import cars</a> past the United States government before they’re legal to import, thanks to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/paul-walkers-nissan-skyline-r34/">infamous 25-year rule</a>. When those people are caught, the cars are then <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/seized-corvette-and-camaro/">seized</a> and that seems to be the end of the story. However, once at least some of those seized cars get auctioned off by feds to the public. In other words, one person’s loss could be another’s big gain of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/900-hp-nissan-r34/">Nissan R34</a>and many other vehicles.</p>

<p>Just such an auction took place on September 20 up with 20 exciting vehicle lots. The catch is the buyer can’t keep them in the country but instead must <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ship-carrying-luxury-cars/">ship them somewhere else</a> immediately. That was a big sticking point for a lot of people, but determined buyers with connections outside the US were more likely to find a way.</p>

<p>There just so happened to be a Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 in this auction. Seven of the lots were Nissan <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-rocket-bunny-nissan-silvia-s14-looks-a-little-mopar/">Silvia S15s</a>, so if you know someone who’s a fan this could be their shot at one or more. Most of the other cars were not nearly as exciting, such as a Toyota Artisto V300 and a Nissan Stagea wagon. Why someone so desperately wanted to import these vehicles isn’t known, but it’s possible an enterprising person thought they could sell the illegal rides for top dollar.</p>

<p>The other catch with these auction vehicles is they’re all in some state of disassembly. We’re not sure if the people trying to import them did that to try throwing off customs officials, but if so it obviously didn’t work. Considering their condition, you could probably swing some pretty sweet deals.</p>
