<p>The fight to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg isn’t just a fight over the Supreme Court and the trajectory of the law. It’s a fight over what your days are like.</p>
<p>You want your feet to hurt less at the end of the day. They want to crush the union fighting for your breaks to be longer and your pay to be higher. That’s why they want to steal this seat.</p>
<p>You want to wake up in the morning thinking about the business you’re going to start. They want you to wake up in the middle of the night sweating about the health benefits you’d lose if you did, so that you keep working for them. That’s why they’re desperate to steal this seat.</p>
<p>You want to learn what you need to be a good citizen and get ahead in a tough economy. They want you balled and chained with debt, paying them interest forever. That’s why they will do anything to steal this seat.</p>
<p>You want to bring life into this world when it’s the right moment for you and your family. They want to control your body to buy the votes of certain religious people so that their tax cuts benefiting many fewer people can pass. That’s why they will violate their own past vows to steal this seat.</p>
