Emails will sort automatically in the app based on the split-inboxes you create, for example, I have: \"Important,\" \"News,\" and \"Other,\" so your inbox will always be organized and cleared in no time. My favorite feature by far is Snippets – a simpler way to respond. We've all received emails back to back that require almost the exact same response (especially if you "

Downie can also download videos (or even, just the audio) from over 1,200 more sites, including Instagram, Facebook, Vimeo, and others. It also features a \"User Guided Extraction\" feature so you can download videos Downie isn't able to do on its own. It's super useful! Additionally, unlike many other YouTube downloaders, Downie can handle even 4K resolution videos. It's also tightly integrated into another app I love, Permute, a powerful media converter. To convert the video you’ve just downloaded to a different format or stitch parts of it into one file simply download with Downie and directly open in Permute. "

          " is the smarter sibling to copying and pasting. I find that multiple times a day, I see or read something that would be great to save, use, or share. The issue there is that if I forget to paste the first text I copied, then copy something new, it's gone. And sometimes, it's really difficult to dig and find it again. Paste solves that issue. It keeps everything you copy and stores it for future use. With extended clipboard capacity, things like quotes, recipes, vacation ideas, or future purchase goals are all stored worry-free and synced between all of your devices. You can also edit the copied data in the app before pasting it elsewhere. For things you will be using regularly, Paste offers a \"pin\" feature to keep the important data at your fingertips."
