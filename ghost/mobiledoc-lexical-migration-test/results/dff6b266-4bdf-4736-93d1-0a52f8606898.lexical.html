<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at Cloud M1’s <em>Ayo The Clown</em>. The game is slated to release in August 2020 on PC and Nintendo Switch if the stretch goal is reached. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p><strong>Ayo the Clown is about courage, love, friendship, and the amazing things that happen when you never give up. </strong></p>
    <p>With Ayo the Clown, we’d like to reintroduce you to the incredibly fun platformer games of the ‘90s where platforming is accompanied by an inspiring and memorable story. </p>
    <p>Ayo the clown has a very unique and <strong>cute art style</strong> that everybody loves. Expect the unexpected as this clown takes you through a world of imagination. Just think, if <strong>Super Mario Bros., Yoshi, Kirby, and Little Big Planet</strong> had a child, this would be it.</p>
