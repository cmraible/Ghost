Back in the day Plymouth dealers would play the following propaganda to show visitors who were even considering the 1970 Chevrolet Camaro how silly they were. After all, the 1970 Plymouth ‘Cuda and Barracuda were far superior muscle cars, at least according to the experts at Chrysler."

After all, with how overwhelmingly popular the ’69s were, GM apparently felt reskinning them was a wise move. Then when the true 1970 model was unveiled with high expectations, people quickly turned sour on the new Camaro and its heavy European design influence."

On the plus side, 1970 was the absolute pinnacle for the ‘Cuda, but sales for the high-performance muscle car weren’t stellar. Overall, E-Body sales failed to hit the lofty 225,000 units in a single year projection Chrysler brass had been targeting."

There are other pluses with the Plymouth, like a rear quarter-panel window, contoured front seats with a headrest, and a built-in rollbar structure in the roof."
