<p>Two men carjacked a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jeep-trackhawk-durango-hellcat/">Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk</a> recently in Spring, Texas and in the process shot the owner. It’s a scary scenario which should be a reminder we all need to be aware of our surroundings at all times and take extra precautions to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-sale-carjacking/">protect</a> ourselves.</p>

<p>The crime happened back on the night of January 31 at about 9 pm. While we don’t know if the carjackers struck in the driveway of the Jeep owner’s home, we do know the attack took place in a residential area, so that’s entirely possible.</p>
<p>In the process of separating the man from the Jeep Cherokee Trackhawk, one of the suspects shot the victim in the leg. All we know if the Jeep owner was taken to a hospital, hopefully in good condition and is already recovering.</p>
<p>Deputies chased the suspects in the stolen Jeep down Highway 249. However, the suspects must have fairly good driving skills because they lost the deputies. It probably didn’t hurt that they were driving a much faster vehicle. We’re hopeful investigators are able to track down and apprehend these guys because if they get away with this, the likelihood they’ll do it again is quite high.</p>
<p>An unfortunate part of reality is that car theft in many areas is still ridiculously common. Not content just to break into vehicles and steal them in the middle of the night, some criminals have decided carjackings are a better way to go. That means they’re willing to use violence to separate you from your ride, which is truly scary.</p>
<p>Criminals will often strike when you’re in transition areas, like getting into or out of your vehicle. You’re more likely to be distracted and not paying attention to your surroundings in those situations, leaving you open to attack.</p>
