Think the big Q for outlets is whether to feed the beast or not after many tried and failed doing that with FB in the past. YouTube, though, is slightly different since it boosts a site's SEO (owned by Alphabet after all), so if played right -- and there's no easy answer to the 'right' way -- it should actually help outlets. The Sun, by way of example, have done some good original interviews on their YouTube channels."
