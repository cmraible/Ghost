<p>The CJ-2A looked very much like a civilian version of the MB tailgate and side-mounted spare tire. One major difference between the MB and the CJ-2A was the grilles of the two vehicles. The MB had recessed headlights and nine-slot grilles while the CJ-2A had larger headlights flush-mounted in a seven-slot grille. In place of the MB's T-84 transmission, the CJ-2A was equipped with the beefier T-90 three-speed transmission. The CJ-2A was still powered by the reliable L-134 Go-Devil engine.</p>

<p>Looking for an alternative to the Ford Bronco because the prices have gotten out of reach, but still want an iconic American SUV…here is your opportunity. The K5 Blazer was produced from 1969 until 1991 where the “Tahoe” badge took over. These were built to perform for the “Blazer” (pun intended) while they went into the woods to explore, hunt, fish or rip down some two-tracks.</p>

<p>Fresh from a dry barn to our hallowed halls we offer for your consideration a 1965 coupe version of Ford's famous pony car. In a faded fair quality respray of Caspian Blue over the original Springtime Yellow, a 289ci V8, and a 3-speed manual you couldn't ask for more in the way of a project that can be made any way you want it. Exterior Faded Caspian Blue covers the fairly straight steel panels that mind their gaps nicely. Body lines that form the classic Mustang cove that is still in use today are true and straight.</p>

<p>This 1995 GMC Sierra is a beast that lived its entire life in California and well over 20 years of red dust is still underneath the truck. While this one might not be a show truck, overall it has held up very well. You will find some chips from the over-sized tires, etc. This rock solid Sierra has just over 70k miles on the odometer, leaving plenty of life left for someone to enjoy it.</p>
