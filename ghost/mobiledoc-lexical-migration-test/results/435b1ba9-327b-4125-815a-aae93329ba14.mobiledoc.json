Built by Mike Harrah over the course of seven years, this semi is packing 12 superchargers and 3,974-horsepower. Matching its extreme ways is the extreme price it fetched at auction, $13.2 million."

          "In the beginning, Thor started off as a 1984 Peterbilt 359 Ultra Custom TT Crew Cab. If you know your trucks you can see that, after you look past the many customizations. One of the most prominent features is the two 14.0-liter Detroit Diesel engines with 12 superchargers bolted up, plus the rows of exhaust pipes on both sides. As the flames shoot out things get pretty wild. If that’s not enough, this thing is packing nitrous."

This thing wouldn’t even be legal to drive on quite a few bridges. Of course, it’s really built for showing off and maybe hitting the drag strip, which is what the four 12-foot parachutes around back are for."

There are a lot of other details, but the mural on the back of cab portrays Thor and some other people in “Viking” garb fighting. It’s so kitsch the art on this semi could’ve been lifted off an 80s D&D manual cover."
