For Afghanistan’s population of about thirty-eight million, the defeat has been incomparably more consequential. The Taliban are reimposing strict Sharia law on the country, which has lost billions of dollars in foreign aid, and the nation is now gripped by a spreading famine. The debates and decisions in Washington, Kabul, and Doha that preceded the Islamic Republic’s fall took place largely in private. Hundreds of pages of meeting notes, transcripts, memoranda, e-mails, and documents, as well as extensive interviews with Afghan and American officials, present a dispiriting record of misjudgment, hubris, and delusion from the very start.”",

For a significant number of investors, it’s a powerful attraction. Yet there’s virtually no connection between MSCI’s ‘better world’ marketing and its methodology. That’s because the ratings don’t measure a company’s impact on the Earth and society. In fact, they gauge the opposite: the potential impact of the world on the company and its shareholders. MSCI doesn’t dispute this characterization. It defends its methodology as the most financially relevant for the companies it rates.”",

But it appears that two of the four people may have another reason to oppose Biden's plan: They work for fossil fuel companies. ‘Maribeth’ appears to be Maribeth Anderson, who heads government relations for Antero Resources and once headed the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association. Antero describes itself as an ‘independent oil and natural gas company’ and operates both in Colorado and in West Virginia. ‘Mackenzie’ appears to be MacKenzie Morley, marketing director for CJ Hughes. According to its website, CJ Hughes was founded as a ‘drilling contractor for the gas and petroleum industries’ and now does construction for the ‘water, sanitary, natural gas and petroleum industries.’”",
