<hr>
<p>The scary, sci-fi action is one reason to watch Netflix's <em>Stranger Things</em>, but if you're like us, the true joy is watching the amazingly accurate <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/80s/">1980s</a> references – especially the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic cars</a>. With a fourth season on the way, the show is creating a little more hype for fans with a new "drive-into experience" that promises to bring all of the horror of Hawkins, Indiana to Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>As we head into the season normally filled with parties and haunted houses, the Stranger Things: The Drive Into Experience might be the perfect way to celebrate Halloween in a socially distant manner from the safety of your own car. The website promises "a brand new event concept where you drive into the world of Hawkins and experience the upside down" with "mind-blowing audio and visual effects." </p>
<p>The teaser for the experience shows a frontage similar to the Starcourt Mall featured in the most reason season of <em>Stranger Things</em>, as well as all of the kids, cars and creatures from the show. This unique experience seems to combine the elements of a haunted house, drive-in movie and an amusement park ride all in one, and it looks awesome!</p>

<p>The hour-long experience will take place at a currently undisclosed location in central L.A, and it opens in October with tickets being released on August 26th starting at $59 per car. A dedicated Facebook page for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/strangerthingsdriveinto/">Stranger Things: The Drive Into Experience</a> states that "right now, the experience will be in Los Angeles only, but nothing is out of the question in the future. We recommend you to stay tuned."</p>
