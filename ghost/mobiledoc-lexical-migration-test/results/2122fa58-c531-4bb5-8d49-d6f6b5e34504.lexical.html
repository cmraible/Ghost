<hr>
<p>If anyone on December 31 thought 2023 was going to finally be a normal, sane year they were sadly disappointed. And while we’ve had everything from Chinese spy balloons to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-body-shames-leprechauns/">Dodge body shaming leprechauns</a>, I don’t think anyone thought they would fill that spot on their 2023 bingo card of reality TV star Honey Boo Boo being in a Dodge Charger that ran from cops.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, you were probably hoping you’d never hear about Honey Boo Boo again. I’ve never watched whatever <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/car-social-media-influencers/">“reality” show</a> she was on, but I’ve heard so much about the girl I feel like I might as well have see it. Now 17-years-old, Alana Thompson (thankfully her real name isn’t Honey) has already had an uncomfortable brush with the law in Georgia.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, she was riding in a Dodge Charger driven by her boyfriend, 21-year-old Dralin Carswell, when the guy for whatever reason decided to run from cops in Monroe County, Georgia. Thankfully, it sounds like Honey Boo Boo was only a victim in this case.</p>
<p>Everything started when a deputy ran the Charger’s tag as the muscle car was at a gas station. A misdemeanor traffic charge from another county pulled up for Carswell, so the deputy tried pulling the Mopar over. Carswell decided to see if he could live up to his surname, leading the deputy on a three-mile-long chase.</p>
<p>With superior training at his disposal, the deputy was able to PIT the Dodge Charger, bringing the chase to a close quickly. Carswell was arrested and charged with DUI, drug possession, and following too close. As for Thompson the TV star, she wasn’t charged with anything but instead is being treated as a witness. Hopefully Honey Boo Boo makes better decisions on who to date moving forward.</p>
