And while these classics aren’t nearly as expensive as some classic muscle cars, their values have been trending upwards recently. A lot of enthusiasts and collectors seem to have realized these are great cars to have in a collection, which might be why this admittedly rough 1963 Chevrolet Impala SS 327 we found on Craigslist is listed for $14,999."

We’re not sure if there are any serious rust spots, but there are so up-close pictures of the rocker on the driver’s side right behind the front wheel, which looks a little concerning, but we can't tell for sure. Otherwise, the bodywork looks pretty solid and the bumpers shine. Some people would just leave the patina for that well-earned charm."

The seller says he has plenty of parts on hand, so you might be able to pick up whatever you need. Or you could find them elsewhere. That’s what’s great about buying something so ubiquitous."

Maybe it is, but why not put that down? That absolutely affects value, so we’d ask the guy before getting serious. At least he mentions he has a clean title ready to go."
