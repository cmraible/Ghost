<p>Finished in a matte black with carbon fiber decals on the hood and trunk, this '70 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/600-hp-1962/">Nova restomod</a> has a bark as mean as its bite. Everything is in immaculate shape considering just 50 miles have accumulated on the build since completion. A set of staggered Coys wheels with a black powder-coat finish (20x14 rear, 18x7 front) occupy all four corners and come shod with sticky Mickey Thompson rubber. According to the description, the hood took 50 hours of fabricating so it could fit around the protruding intakes from attached to its menacing mill. Even more, the rear bumper took 30 hours of work, and meticulous attention to detail is apparent on this Nova's smooth body as the side markers and door handles have been shaved.</p>
<p>Powering "Black Nasty" is a large, twin-turbocharged 6.9-liter V8 engine that generates an impressive 650-horsepower. A pro-built 350 automatic transmission equipped with a super kit and the 3,000 stall shifts power down to twist a heavy-duty 8.5-inch rear end with a posi-diff with steep 4.11 gears. Many would think Pontiac in regards to the 421-cubic-inch V8 engine stuffed inside the bay, but this insane Nova <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/restomods-on-motorious/">restomod</a> is actually powered by a Dart SHP short-block crate engine full of modifications. Mechanical highlights on the Sportsman High Performance include an Eagle rotating assembly, steel crankshaft, forged pistons, H-beam rods, Comp Cams valvetrain, a Quick Fuel carburetor, and an MSD ignition. Keeping the thirst for fuel quenched is a 16-gallon fuel cell that is fed by braided lines and an electric pump.</p>
<p>This Nova restomod can dive into apexes and corner carve with the best of them. The car features welded frame connectors, tubular control arms, a narrowed rear end, and coil-over shocks. Spent gases are sent through a dual exhaust system that with an exit setup behind the front wheels. </p>
<p>Open the doors to this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1966-nove-prostreet/">Nova</a> to reveal an interior featuring upholstery that is Ostrich-textured from the competition seats down to the sun visors. Even the rear seat is completely custom with "Black Nasty" embroidered on the back of the seats. Even the interior is far from your average classic Nova. </p>
