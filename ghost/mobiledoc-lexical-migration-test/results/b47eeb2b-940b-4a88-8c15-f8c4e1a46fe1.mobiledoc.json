The learning curve is gradual and generous. The levels add different toppings and more paths at a pace that never feels overwhelming or unfair. And unlike free mobile games with similar concepts and more predatory methods, you won’t be penalised or have to sit through irrelevant ads for using a hint or skipping a level. The game is constructed in such a way that it eases you into every new aspect. This is the kind of game that is just stimulating enough to play while watching a show without being a distraction."

The music is rhythmic and soft but still manages to be stimulating; the hint and level skip systems ensure that even when the puzzles are tricky, you won’t get stuck; and the soothing voice over that narrates your journey all adds up to a marshmallow of a game - a warm blanket."
