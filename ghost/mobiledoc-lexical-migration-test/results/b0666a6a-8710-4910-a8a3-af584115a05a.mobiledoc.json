After some debate among the members of the council, that was changed to 8 Dodge Chargers, we’re assuming not Hellcats, but maybe Scat Packs? The whole thing is pretty controversial."

Since a lot of well-funded criminals drive fast cars, including Hellcats, it makes sense the police want something which can go toe-to-toe with what the bad guys have."

Before you think they’re crazy, keep in mind police vehicles have to receive unique upfits made for law enforcement, pushing the cost beyond what you would pay for a Hellcat. That price tag didn’t sit well with some members of the council, hence the alternative proposal was made."
