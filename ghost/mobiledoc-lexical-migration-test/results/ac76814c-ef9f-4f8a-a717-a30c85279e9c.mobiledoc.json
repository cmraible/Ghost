Among the impressive list of components is a custom ISKY camshaft, 750 Holley 4bbl carb, MSD ignition system, and Edelbrock intake manifold as well as aluminum heads. That setup is good for a claimed 500-horsepower, more than enough to get this pony scooting in a hurry."

That hood is made of fiberglass and features a unique scoop, while there’s a vented front valance, chrome bumpers, GT light bar, custom Boyd Coddington wheels, and dual exhaust pipes coming out of the rear valance for a completely unique look.

A custom two-tone black and white upholstery mimics the original pattern. You’ll note the custom center console with storage and dual cupholders, a nice modern luxury to have onboard. Auto Meter Phantom gauges, custom steering wheel, and a CD player help complete the upgraded feel."
