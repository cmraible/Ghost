Rather than simply riding the coattails of their previous successes, the newer vehicles are focused on constant innovation. This particular vehicle is an example of what Porsche has been able to accomplish over its reign as Germany’s greatest sports car brand. Despite the car having been made in 2010, it still keeps up with today's supercars. So what is it about this Porsche 997.2 GT3 RS that makes it such an impressive performance car for anyone with a taste for German cars?"

Spinning tires is an incredibly easy feat for the car as the Porsche sports one of the brand’s best powerhouses. Utilizing 3.8-liters of displacement, this ridiculous flat-six engine can push out a massive 450-horsepower, with components borrowed from the GT3 RSR race car."
