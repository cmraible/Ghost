<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We all thought the election was over a week ago, but Trump and the Republicans seem intent on trying to drag it out. This week, we published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trump-is-staging-a-coup-why-are-dems/">story</a> on the Electoral College shenanigans — and some called it alarmist. But as the days goes by it looks like the opposite — a necessary alarm.</p>
<p>As I wrote before, I don’t think the GOP will be able to pull it off — but there’s still a chance they could, which should be extremely troubling to everyone. Democrats’ silence is bewildering, because even if you think they are sellouts on the issues, presumably they do want to win the election. Staying silent while the GOP moves forward is just bizarre. (Sidenote: We have a live cast coming up on the evening of Wednesday 11/18 with Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser to discuss all this — so SAVE THE DATE).</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind: even if the Electoral College results do end up respecting the popular vote and giving the presidency to Biden, clearly Republicans are road testing a strategy they will try to use in the future, in the event that there is another close election. This should be a reminder that we need to get rid of the antiquated Electoral College system as soon as possible (and I’m thrilled that national popular vote legislation here in Colorado — sponsored by my spouse Emily — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/931891674/as-presidency-hinges-on-a-handful-of-states-some-have-made-a-popular-vote-pact">survived</a> a GOP ballot challenge in the election!).</p>
<p>Separately, I just want to thank everyone for your participation in this past week’s live event with Sen. Nina Turner and pollster Ben Tulchin (you can <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/what-actually-happened">watch the replay here</a> if you missed it). Thanks for bearing with us through the technical challenges — we are testing out different platforms to make this as smooth an experience as possible for everyone. There may be a few more bumps along the way — but please know we are working hard to make sure the experience is smooth for everyone.</p>
<p>It’s not easy building this grassroots media outlet from scratch — there are a lot of ups and downs and complications, and the hours are long. But I hope you can see the progress we are making, and the impact our reporting is having. I also hope you value the community we are building — the connection with Daily Poster subscribers has really made this such a great experience. I genuinely feel like we are building something sustainable and lasting — and we couldn’t do it without you.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>past week was a long year. I don’t know about you, but I’m mentally exhausted from it all. Yes, I am relieved that Trump is on his way out, but mostly I feel overwhelmed and tired — and the worst part is, we all know that money never sleeps, so if we take a rest, then nothing will fundamentally change. Indeed, these next few weeks and months could determine the next few years.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that we are in for a rough winter — the pandemic will likely get worse, Trump will probably try to do damage on his way out of office and we’re all suffering from a form of mass PTSD from the year we’ve experienced. But I still remain optimistic that 2020 could be a year that catalyzes positive change.</p>
<p>Think about it; even as we’ve been quarantined and socially isolated, this has been a year of collective experience like few others. In many years, we are going through our own lives, doing our own thing. But this year, we’ve all gone through a pandemic, a national election and a climate crisis that has touched every corner of the country.</p>
<p>Every person in America has been touched by these things — and so while we may feel particularly polarized and divided, I think there’s a chance that these collective experiences have reminded us that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s me being overly optimistic or unrealistic, because sure, there is an entire media misinformation machine designed to continue ripping us apart and isolating us in our own news bubbles. But I think the experiences have been so powerful and formative that they will have a lasting effect — and I think we may look back on this year as a time when we realized that our lives are all intertwined, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, I published a book called <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/168043/the-uprising-by-david-sirota/">The Uprising</a> — which was about how politics was becoming a competition between progressives and conservatives to try to harness populist anger at an economic system that has turned America into a feudalism. The book proved to be prescient — and I think we are once again at such a turning point, with a moment of opportunity.</p>
<p>We’re trying to do our part here at The Daily Poster to try to make sure that opportunity is seized — and we couldn’t do it without your support. The stakes are high: Whether or not we as a society seize this opportunity will determine the future of the country and the planet.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota.</p>
