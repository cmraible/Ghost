That’s why we’re fascinated with this build where a guy dropped a Dodge Demon powertrain into his Chrysler, making for one hell of a sleeper that’s sure to shock plenty of unsuspecting people."

We think it’s all about the crazy power and exclusivity of the Demon, which we’re sure was also a factor. Whatever the reason, this build is the kind we like to see."

That’s right, in Australia American muscle has an exotic flavor, although with the long line of muscle cars made in the island nation back in the day they have a familiar quality about them as well. Also, they have some Bentleys there and since the modern Chrysler 300’s design is an obvious rip-off of Bentley, there’s that strange European quality in there as well."

While that’s interesting, we would also like to see it in action doing a big burnout and some quarter-mile runs. Maybe they’ll do that next? Anyway, check it out."
