<hr>
<p>After listing their vehicles for sale online, four different owners found <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-orlando-classic-cars/">their rides had been stolen</a>. It wasn’t until the owner of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-toyota-supra-go-from-field-to-amazing/">Toyota</a> filed a report with the local police that the alleged <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">thief was caught</a> with all three vehicles in his possession. What’s more shocking is that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mechanic/">former mechanic</a> used a large stash of duplicate keys to pull the thefts off without a hitch.</p>
<p>Bharath B M alias Preetham of Channasandra, India was able to abscond with a Toyota Fortuner, a Benelli motorcycle, and two Royal Enfield motorcycles before he was finally caught by police. The man had collected all kinds of keys while working as a mechanic at a dealership. What he would do is show up to take a car for a test drive, then when he returned give a key that looked like the original to the owner while retaining the key that goes to the car. Then he would return later and take the vehicle.</p>
<p>It took authorities doing some good gumshoe detective work to track the guy down, but he’s been brought to justice and all four vehicles were thankfully recovered.</p>
<p>Car scams and theft techniques don’t just stay in one part of the world anymore, so while reading about a guy stealing cars in southern India might not sound threatening to readers in North America, a similar scheme could easily be used around here. In other words, if you’re selling a car you need to be careful. This is just one of far too many scams out there.</p>
<p>We keep pointing out that car thefts are high right now. Part of this is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">from the coronavirus shutdowns</a> since criminals like to go after vehicles which sit for a long time. Another thing fueling car thefts and which looks to be setting up <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">even more in the near future</a> is the scarcity of new cars and new car parts. With <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/used-car-prices-soar-pandemic/">more demand</a> for private vehicles as people avoid public transportation and ride sharing services, there are even more financial incentives to swipe cars.</p>
