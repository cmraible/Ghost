<p>The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) determines how to invest the retirement funds of the nation’s federal employees, including military service members, meaning it controls the largest defined contribution plan in the world. Since he has the ability to fill five seats on the board, Pres. Joe Biden has a chance to stack the body with nominees committed to making the retirement plan the largest pension fund in the world to divest from fossil fuels. The move would be a big climate win for the administration, since, as the old political adage goes, personnel is policy. But an early look at Biden’s board nominees suggests climate activists shouldn’t get their hopes up.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen a perfect world. I never will. But, I know that a world warmed by 2 degrees Celsius is far preferable to one warmed by 3 degrees, or 6. And that I’m willing to fight for it, with everything I have, because it is everything I have. I don’t need a guarantee of success before I risk everything to save the things, the people, the places that I love. Before I try to save myself.” — Climate writer Mary Heglar’s 2019 essay, <a href="https://medium.com/@maryheglar/home-is-always-worth-it-d2821634dcd9">“Home is Always Worth It.”</a></p>

<p>President Joe Biden has announced four nominees for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), the board that oversees the nearly $800 billion federal pension fund. The appointments are significant because these board members will decide how to invest the retirement funds of the nation’s federal employees, including military service members.</p>
<p>Moreover, as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-is-ignoring-an-easy-climate-victory/"><em>The Daily Poster</em> recently reported</a>, the current FRTIB board members have so far resisted divesting the pension fund from fossil fuels and shielding it from climate-related financial risks.</p>
<p>Biden had a chance to fill the board with nominees committed to make the retirement plan the largest pension fund in the world to divest from climate risks. But an <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/biden-picks-fintech-speculator-and-morgan-stanley-alum-for-federal-pensions-board/">early look</a> at the nominees by the Revolving Door Project, a government watchdog group, suggests that several of Biden’s picks, including a financial technology speculator and a former Morgan Stanley portfolio manager, are going to need to be pressured into divesting the fund.</p>
<p>“​​We should hope that a President who signed an executive order on greening the financial system would respond appropriately to the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]’s dire new report and put his government’s literal money where his mouth is,” the Revolving Door Project wrote in a blog post about the new nominees. “The actual names we’ve gotten, however, are a mixed bag... While some nominees appear to have workers and the planet’s interests at heart, they may have to fend off those looking to use civil servants’ nest eggs as more fuel for their speculative investment engines.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

    <li><strong>MOULTON SLAMS BIDEN ON AFGHANISTAN REFUGEES: </strong>Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/08/17/seth-moulton-joe-biden-afghanistan-evacuation/">said</a> he agreed with Joe Biden’s speech Monday defending his decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, but sharply criticized the president for suggesting that the tragic scenes of Afghan people desperately trying to board U.S. aircraft was the fault of those individuals not wanting to leave sooner. Moulton called the remark “utter BS,” noting that there has been a “backlog of Special Immigrant Visa applications for over a decade.” The administration is under increasing pressure from <a href="https://twitter.com/OurRevolution/status/1427694212653326339?s=20">Democratic lawmakers</a> to expedite the process of bringing in refugees from Afghanistan as the Taliban returns to power in the country. On Monday, the administration <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/568125-biden-authorizes-500m-more-for-afghan-refugee-relocation">authorized $500 million</a> for refugee relocation.</li>
    <li><strong>WHITE COLLAR CRIME PROSECUTIONS CONTINUE LONG-TERM DECLINE:</strong> The latest data from the Justice Department suggests that while white collar crime prosecutions may be recovering slightly from their dip during the pandemic, they have continued to follow a <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/crim/655">downward trend</a> that has been ongoing since 2001. According to the report, prosecutions have fallen nearly 25 percent in the last five years, thanks in part to the FBI focusing much of its attention on combatting terrorism.</li>
    <li><strong>WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS WON THE AFGHANISTAN WAR: </strong>An <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/08/17/investors-us-weapon-makers-only-clear-winners-afghan-war?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1629225325">analysis</a> by the watchdog group Public Citizen found that weapons contractor stocks saw massive returns in the two decades the U.S. was at war in Afghanistan. Lockheed Martin saw the biggest returns, with a 1,236-percent stock bump. Northrop Grumman, meanwhile, boasted 1,196-percent returns. According to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/08/16/pakistan-united-states-afghanistan-taliban/"><em>Foreign Policy</em></a>, most of the $145 billion spent by the U.S. on reconstruction and related activities in Afghanistan was siphoned away by the defense industry: “Because of heavy reliance on a complex ecosystem of defense contractors, Washington banditry, and aid contractors, between 80 and 90 percent of outlays actually returned to the U.S. economy.”</li>

    <li><strong>SACKLER FAMILY CONTINUES BANKRUPTCY SHAKEDOWN:</strong> David Sackler, an heir to the Sackler opioid fortune, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-opioids-c80801f8e19e688ea95a09a2face2ff0?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP&utm_campaign=SocialFlow">told</a> a federal bankruptcy court on Tuesday that the family would not contribute billions it promised to a legal settlement fund for victims of the opioid crisis unless his family and its business empire was freed from liability for future opioid-related lawsuits. The proposed settlement is part of the bankruptcy case of Purdue Pharma, the family business, which manufactures Oxycontin. Sackler told the court that unless the family scores a guarantee of immunity, it would litigate the bankruptcy claims “to their final outcome.”</li>
    <li><strong>MINORITY VOTERS SURGING BUT FACE GERRYMANDER THREAT: </strong>The 2020 census had some good news for Democrats in terms of demographics shifts. The white majority shrank by about 8 percent, while the country’s Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations grew by 23, 35, and 5.6 percent, respectively. In total, the multiracial population grew by a staggering 276 percent. Even so, experts are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/gerrymandering-could-limit-minority-voters-power-even-after-census-gains.html">warning</a> that Republican gerrymandering can undermine the power of minority voters.</li>
    <li><strong>DEM LEADERS SIDE WITH PROGRESSIVES ON INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY: </strong>Conservative Democrats are pushing House leaders to hold a vote on the Senate’s $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal immediately, before voting on the much larger, $3.5 trillion infrastructure budget package being written by Senate Democrats. Progressive lawmakers believe such a move would ultimately doom the bigger bill. Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/81721-0">have sided</a> with progressives thus far, insisting that the efforts remain linked. Pelosi and House leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/house-dems-pressure-campaign-budget-505614">are pressing</a> their caucus to stick together and vote next week in favor of a rule to advance the bipartisan deal and move the broader budget bill forward.</li>
