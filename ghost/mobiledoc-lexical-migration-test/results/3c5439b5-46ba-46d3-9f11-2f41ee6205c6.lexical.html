<p>Confession: I love my <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vyx4R2">GoPro Hero 7 Black</a>. It's just a lovely device. Sure, it's pricey. But I can carry it everywhere, and I can use it wherever I want, without risk. It got me footage of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glSGPOWwKkE">Shoreham Light Parade</a>, despite driving rain, that would have killed any other device I won stone dead. It did the same during a family trip last year. </p>
<p>Just this morning, I had a brief beach walk with my daughters, which probably wasn't the brightest move, given that Storm Freya was making her presence felt, and my three year old was in danger of becoming airborne. Despite that, I was happy to get a shot like this from my GoPro, in the face of wind, rain and salt spray from the sea:</p>

<p>Much as I love the images from my iPhone, it is not great friends with salt water. </p>
<p>So, I love my GoPro — but I still <a href="https://gopro.com/news/hero7-black-dusk-white-color-launch-2019">really don't understand the appeal of this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>What’s white, but not quite, and black all over? GoPro’s new limited-edition <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/cameras/hero7-black/CHDHX-701-master.html">HERO7 Black</a> camera in Dusk White, available around the world beginning March 3. This is the first time GoPro has released a special colorway of its flagship camera, which means you get all the goodness of the award-winning HERO7 Black, at the same $399.99 price, while earning bonus points for limited-edition style.</blockquote>
<p>I tend to see cameras as utility objects. I don't care much how they look, as long as they feel good in the hand, and work the way I want them to. So, making a fashion choice for something as functional as an action cam seems… strange. </p>
<p>But then, we're talking about action sports here, where things like the gear you wear can be a major fashion choice. So this is, perhaps, a smart choice. GoPro's had a pretty rough ride financially the last few years. If this keeps their latest flagship camera selling a few months into the cycle - all the better. I'd like to see the company stick around. </p>
<p>And it's hella pretty:</p>

<p>You can even accessorize it with a <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/mounts-accessories/shorty/AFTTM-master.html?dwvar_AFTTM-master_color=DuskWhite">matching grip/tripod accessory</a>. And there's a <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/accessories-2/sleeve-plus-lanyard/ACSST-master.html?dwvar_ACSST-master_color=NeonYellow">lanyard case</a> that's a collaboration with a celeb, too:</p>
<blockquote>We partnered with GoPro athlete and MotoGP legend, Valentino Rossi, to create a neon yellow Sleeve + Lanyard emblazoned with Rossi’s race number, 46.</blockquote>

<p>Which is probably going to appeal to someone.</p>
<p>You know, the more I look at it, the more it grows on me. I could be converted to this Dusk White thing. C'mon GoPro PR, you know where I am…</p>
