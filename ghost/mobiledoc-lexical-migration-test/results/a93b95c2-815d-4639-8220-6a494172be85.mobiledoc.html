<p>This 1967 Ford Mustang is an A Code car that came out of Southern Indiana and Kentucky. This is a very solid Mustang that is an older restoration that still looks great, but has some minor wear and tear from driving over the years. Some minor scratches and stone chips. This is a real A Code which means it came with a 289 V8 and 4 Barrel Carb along with 4 Speed Manual Transmission from the factory.</p>

<p><strong>$9,900</strong></p>
<p>The 1998 Trans Am was the first year model that got the LS1 engine under the hood of a T/A. From there, it was history as these cars became known for their high-performance powertrain that could blow nearly everything out of the water, at the time. This white example has just 86K miles on the clock, and looks extremely well cared for. </p>
