That’s especially true when you have two muscle cars which on paper seem to be fairly evenly matched, considering both are racing in the Factory Stock class. The Challenger RT is packing a 440ci V8 with Six Pack for a factory-stated 390-horsepower and a massive 490 lb.-ft. of torque. Meanwhile the COPO Camaro ZL1 has an aluminum 427ci V8 with a factory-stated 430-horsepower and 450 lb.-ft. of torque on tap. Both of these cars are outfitted with a 3-speed automatic transmission, which is disappointing but puts them on the same level. Plus, the Dodge has 4.30 gears versus 4.10 gears in the Chevy, giving the Mopar a slight advantage there.",
