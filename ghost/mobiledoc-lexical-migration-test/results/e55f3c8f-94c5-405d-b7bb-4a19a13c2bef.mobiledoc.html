But since then, federal fecklessness and rushed reopenings have wasted the benefits of months of social distancing…My worry from March feels less far-fetched. If America could underperform so badly against one rapidly spreading virus, how would it fare against two?”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/climate/oil-fracking-bankruptcy-methane-executive-pay.html">Fracking Firms Fail, Rewarding Executives and Raising Climate Fears</a> (NY Times) — <em>“Oil and gas companies in the United States are hurtling toward bankruptcy at a pace not seen in years…And in the wake of this economic carnage is a potential environmental disaster — unprofitable wells that will be abandoned or left untended, even as they continue leaking planet-warming pollutants, and a costly bill for taxpayers to clean it all up. Still, as these businesses collapse, millions of dollars have flowed to executive compensation.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://blowback.show">Blowback</a> (Stitcher) — <em>I did a road trip to southern Colorado last weekend, and listened to some episodes of the new podcast called “Blowback.” It looks back on the Iraq War, providing some deep history and context — and also a bit of dark humor. You should definitely listen to this series.</em></p>
