<p>With a little over 8,000 miles on the odometer, this R8 is practically brand new, and its overall condition shows that. There are no scrapes on the wheels or front splitter, and the interior looks as pristine as when it rolled off the assembly line. If you like the blue exterior color, you'll love the black leather cabin with the blue contrast stitching and diamond pattern suede headliner.</p>
<p>The Audi R8 is as luxurious as it is sporty with a cabin packed full of all the latest technology and entertainment. The gauge cluster is fully digital, and it can be reconfigured to show various information including the navigation map. Likewise, the sport bucket seats are as good at providing a comfortable ride as they are at keeping occupants in place when the car is being tossed into corners.</p>

<p>Not only does the R8 deliver all of the amenities of a modern luxury vehicle, it also packs quite a punch in terms of performance and handling. While the base R8 is no slouch with its 5.2-liter V-10 rated at 540-horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque, the V10 Plus ups the power output to 610 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. Of course, Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive helps ensure that all this power is easily manageable.</p>
