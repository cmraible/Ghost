<p>Far too many news headlines these days read like something out of one of the most famous short stories of all time, a once radical work of fiction that details the horrors of the mob mentality and public refusal to make real change. In this week’s Weekend Reader below, we examine that story and explore the work that needs to be done to finally break the long cycle of compliance and communal trauma.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2424656/mystery-behind-photo-logged-old-growth-tree"><strong>The Mystery Behind A Photo Of A Logged Old-Growth Tree</strong></a> (Outside) <em>— “The viral photo and its mounting mystery have added fuel to an already white-hot standoff on southern Vancouver Island, where more than 170 forest defenders have been arrested since May 17. An organization that calls itself the Rainforest Flying Squad is managing blockades on logging roads into Fairy Creek and Caycuse, two adjacent old-growth watersheds near the town of Port Renfrew. Fairy Creek is said to be the last unprotected, intact old-growth watershed on southern Vancouver Island. Both valleys are home to trees that rival the world’s largest. ‘No matter what government or industry tells you, they’re still logging old-growth forests on huge scale across Vancouver Island and B.C.,’ says Watt.”</em></p>

He was more than a hashtag or a name on a list of tragic victims. He was more than an article or an essay or posthumous profile. He was more than a headline or an op-ed or a news package or the news cycle. He was more than a retweet or shared post. He, doubtless, was more than our likes or emoji tears or hearts or praying hands. He was more than an R.I.P. t-shirt or placard. He was more than an autopsy or a transcript or a police report or a live-streamed hearing. He, for damn sure, was more than the latest reason for your liberal white friend’s ephemeral outrage. He was more than a rally or a march. He was more than a symbol, more than a movement, more than a cause. He. Was. </em>Loved<em>.” (Winner of a 2021 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2021/6/9/22522944/paradise-lost-anniversary-memphis-three-true-crime-documentaries"><strong>Tipped Scales</strong></a> (The Ringer) <em>— “As the first in a trilogy of </em>Paradise Lost<em> films about the case, the 1996 movie </em>[The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]<em> was a stunning example of cinéma vérité, as directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky embedded themselves with the prosecution, the defense, and the families of both the slain and the accused to put human faces on a heart-wrenching tragedy, as well as highlight the overblown worries of satanic rituals and murderous cults that proliferated throughout the 1980s and ’90s. A spiritual successor to Errol Morris’s </em>The Thin Blue Line<em>, and a forerunner of more recent documentaries like </em>Making a Murderer<em>, the film stands today as the most affecting examination of one of the most studied legal cases in U.S. history — one that put heavy metal lyrics and black T-shirts on trial and helped lay the groundwork for the current thinking around false confessions.”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster"><strong>A Message From The Daily Poster:</strong></h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>David is still off, so this is once again Joel Warner, <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> managing editor, with a few thoughts to share.</p>
<p>In response to David’s story this week, “<a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-lottery-society/">The Lottery Society</a>,” one of our supporters reminded us of Shirley Shirley Jackson’s famous short story, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/06/26/the-lottery">The Lottery</a>,” which according to <em>The New Yorker</em>, was originally published in the magazine on June 18, 1948 — exactly 73 years from the day I am writing this message.</p>
<p>Despite its age, the story has lost none of its power. For those who haven’t read it, Jackson’s story details a small village that, as part of a long tradition, has everyone take part in an annual lottery. In the particular year described by the story, a local mother is selected through the system and… well, honestly, you should read the story yourself to learn what happens.</p>
<p>The account generated more reader response than any other story <em>The New Yorker</em> had ever published. At least one country, the Union of South Africa, banned publication of the work. But if anything, the story now reads less like a radical work of fiction, and more like a modern news dispatch.</p>
<p>All too often, people these days seem to mindlessly do what they’re told to do, simply because it’s easy or it’s good for them or it’s the way things have always been done. We see that in the asinine <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-lottery-society/">college-for-vaccine sweepstakes</a> David detailed in his story this week, in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporations-kept-bankrolling-the-campaign-against-voting-rights/">violent storming of the Capitol</a> embraced by far too many Republicans and corporate donors, in our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/defending-the-climate-criminals/">communal reluctance to do what’s necessary</a> to avert the mounting climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>No wonder one of our readers wrote to us this week to complain: “It is abundantly clear that absolutely nothing will change.”</p>
<p>I get it. When you look at the dispiriting headlines, and the way those in power seem to be playing the same old games and refusing to make real change, it’s easy to want to give up and go with the flow.</p>
<p>But we can’t do that. If everything was hopeless, if nothing can ever change, we wouldn’t have bothered starting <em>The Daily Poster</em>. Yes, there is so much work left to be done, but little by little, we are beginning to win important battles — and over time, these battles will add up.</p>
<p>In “The Lottery,” the mother selected for the village’s annual tradition cries out, “It isn’t fair, it isn’t right.” But no one listens to her.</p>
<p>Now, however, more and more of us are saying “It isn’t fair, it isn’t right” — and more and more people are listening.</p>
<p>And we aren’t going to stop until our voices are heard. Thank you for joining in the call — with your help, we can break the cycle.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Joel</p>
