The cougar was built upon the same platform as the Mustang at the time and was made to be Mercury’s luxury performance model. To keep with the original idea, the Ringbrothers decided to slap a 5.0L Coyote V8 which transfers a tame but powerful 450 horsepower through a 10-speed automatic transmission which was pulled out of a Ford F-150 Raptor. Handling is made possible by the DSE suspension, HRE wheels, and upgraded brakes that help the car stop on a dime."

When others heard hard times were on the way they ran and hid, however, the Ringbrothers stayed and fought. What came out of it was an incredibly cool and elegant car fit for any car show."
