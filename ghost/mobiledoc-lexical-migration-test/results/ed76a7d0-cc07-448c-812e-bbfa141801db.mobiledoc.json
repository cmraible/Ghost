The basis for the Superbird was the Road Runner, and the nose, airfoil, and basic sheet metal was different between the Daytona and Superbird. The Superbird used front fenders from the '70 Dodge Coronet that helped lead to a better nose design that was 19-inches longer than the base Road Runner. The trunk wing was more angled, and higher, than the Daytonas. The wing was not needed at normal highway speeds, but was designed for the speedways."
