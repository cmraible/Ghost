<p>Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the conservative Democrat from Arizona, has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-group-thanked-sinema-too-soon/">emerged as a chief roadblock</a> to Democrats’ plan to allow Medicare to use its bulk purchasing power to negotiate significantly lower prescription drug prices. Her opposition, which comes on the heels of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">pro-Sinema ad blitz</a> funded by drugmakers, could derail a plan that could save the government billions and cut the cost of many drugs by more than half.</p>
<p>As it turns out, not too long ago, Sinema promised Arizona voters something very different about drug prices.</p>

<p>“Write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that isn’t comfortable… in a world that entices us to browse through the lives of others to help us better determine how we feel about ourselves, and to in turn feel the need to be constantly visible, for visibility these days seems to somehow equate to success, do not be afraid to disappear from it, from us for a while, and see what comes to you in the silence... I dedicate this story to every single survivor of sexual assault.” </p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>Before she threatened to single-handedly take down Democrats’ initiative to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7ZhR34veA">released a campaign ad</a> promising lower drug prices.</p>
<p>“We need to make health care more affordable, with access to the lowest-cost prescriptions, and fix what's broken in the system ​​— not go back to when Arizonans had no say about their health coverage,” Sinema said in the ad, which she released during the 2018 Democratic Senate primary.</p>

<p>Big Pharma’s propaganda machine is firing on all cylinders. <em>The Daily Poster</em> previously reported that the corporate front group Center Forward, which received $4.5 million from Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) between 2016-19, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">has been</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-pharmas-dems-score-ad-blitz/">running ads</a> boosting Sinema and the six House Democrats who are trying to gut Democrats’ drug pricing bill.</p>
<p>Another PhRMA-backed group, the Lupus Foundation of America, has been running ads promoting one of the House lawmakers, Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif.</p>
<p>A <em>Daily Poster</em> subscriber recently flagged a series of ads touting Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who also opposed the party’s drug pricing legislation.</p>
<p>The American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association says in one ad: “Thank you, Representative Rice, for speaking up for autoimmune patients.” The association has received nearly $600,000 from PhRMA since 2010, tax records show.</p>
<p>The Incubate Coalition is separately running ads thanking Rice “for protecting future cures." The coalition’s advisory council <a href="https://www.incubatecoalition.org/about">includes</a> a top lobbyist for PhRMA and executives for drugmakers AbbVie, Amgen, Bayer, Merck, and Pfizer.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Enbridge, the Canadian oil company, has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/enbridge-line-replacement-complete-opens-friday-80301699">announced</a> that tar sands oil will begin flowing through its new Line 3 pipeline this Friday, October 1. The pipeline zigzags across the wetlands of Northern Minnesota and will emit the carbon equivalent of 50 new coal plants. As <em>The Daily Poster</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/its-going-to-spill/">previously reported</a>, despite massive grassroots resistance and pushback from progressive Democrats, President Joe Biden has declined to use his power to stop the project.</p>

    <li><strong>CUTTING PHARMA PROFITS WON’T HAMPER INNOVATION: </strong>A new Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-08/57010-New-Drug-Development.pdf">report</a> on the Democrats’ <a href="__GHOST_URL__/follow-the-pharma-money/">plan to cut drug prices</a> found that limiting pharma company profits would have little impact on drug innovation. In particular, the report found that cutting proceeds from major drugs would reduce the number of new U.S. pharmaceuticals by less than 1 percent over the next decade, and reduce new drug development by just 8 percent over 30 years. “The dollar equivalent is taking $900 billion from Pharma today and getting just 8 to 9 percent reduction in the number of new drugs on the market 30 years from now, and less than that in the coming two decades,” said Tahir Amin, co-founder of <a href="https://www.i-mak.org/">I-MAK</a>, a nonprofit working to improve health care access.</li>

While <a href="https://media.rff.org/documents/IB_21-13_RBmUjTZ_CHOrQKd.pdf">some researchers</a> have touted an emissions-based tax on polluters as an effective way to tackle climate change, activists noted in their letter that “Fossil fuel interests support a carbon tax because they know it will allow them to continue with business as usual, by merely paying a small tax to continue spewing airborne pollutants that significantly damage the health of disadvantaged communities while continuing to contribute to the ever-present climate emergency.” The letter’s authors instead recommended repealing domestic fossil fuel subsidies to help pay for the reconciliation package, an approach the Biden Administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">gave a nod to</a> in his American Jobs Plan.</li>

When overseeing those cases, nearly two-thirds of the judges’ rulings on contested motions landed in favor of the judges’ financial interests. In light of the findings, nearly half of the judges have called on court clerks to notify parties in 300-plus lawsuits of the conflict of interest, a move that could upend past rulings and lead to new judges assigned to the cases.</li>
    <li><strong>FLORIDA LAW GIANT FIGHTS CONDO SAFETY REFORM: </strong>The Florida law firm representing the owners of the Miami Beach condominium that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/surfside-condo-collapse/story?id=80068218">collapsed in June </a>after prolonged structural damage and delayed repairs <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-ne-surfside-collapse-condo-becker-20210928-oa5xaboljrfcxaptqslzujfita-story.html">has spent several decades killing local and state condominium safety measures</a>. The firm, Becker & Poliakoff, has amassed outsized lobbying power and has played a large role in crafting Florida’s lenient condominium safety laws. According to the <em>South Florida Sun Sentinel</em>, “Since 2017, Becker lobbyists appeared at least 560 times in the Florida House of Representatives alone.”</li>

The push comes as part of an effort to pressure the company in anticipation of what could be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/upcoming-ipos/">one of the biggest</a> initial public offerings of the year. “Continuing to utilize Instacart’s services would only enable its unethical behavior, endorse its continued exploitation of workers, and reward its corporate greed,” the Gig Workers’ Collective wrote to customers in an <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/deleteinstacart-b1e138ed88f3">open letter</a> released last week.
