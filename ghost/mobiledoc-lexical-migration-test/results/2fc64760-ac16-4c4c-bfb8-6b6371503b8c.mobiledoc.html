<p>On <em>The Audit</em>, Dave, Josh, and their study-buddy audit a variety of supposedly educational products created by noxious political figures and boil them down to the good stuff. By which they mean‚Ä¶ the bad stuff. </p>
<p><strong>This season, the study group, including Nina Turner, will be auditing the</strong><strong>David Axelrod & Karl Rove MasterClass on campaign strategy and messaging</strong>. Yes, Barack Obama and George W. Bush‚Äôs chief campaign strategists got together to make a quick buck shilling their neoliberal BS on MasterClass ‚Äî and now <em>The Audit</em>‚Äôs study group will sit through the entire thing and ruthlessly tear it to pieces.</p>
