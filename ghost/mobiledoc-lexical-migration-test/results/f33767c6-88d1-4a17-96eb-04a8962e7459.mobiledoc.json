The video shows a four-door Bronco make it almost over an obstacle before having to back down and try another line. It isn't clear if the driver is being given directions off camera or if the driver is relying on the Bronco's 360-degree off-road camera system."

The three Broncos that were photographed included both two- and four-door models, and two of the Broncos were equipped with 33-inch tires while the third Sasquatch Package that includes 35-inch tires. Two of the test vehicles had beadlock wheels, and the images also show the Bronco in various levels of top/door removal."
