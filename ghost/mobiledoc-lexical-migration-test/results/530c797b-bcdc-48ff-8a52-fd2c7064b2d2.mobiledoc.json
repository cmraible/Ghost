The car rides on a fully independent suspension and a set of 15-inch steel wheels sporting black and chrome hubcaps and thin whitewalls hide four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes. Accented with chrome bumpers, folding landau bars, and front fender-mounted mirrors, the exterior is finished in black. Burl wood and chrome trim the interior and offer a good contrast to worn tan upholstery."
