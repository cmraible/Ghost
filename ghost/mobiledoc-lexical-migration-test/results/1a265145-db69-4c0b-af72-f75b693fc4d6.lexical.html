It’s also a preview for what power grids across the country could face as the climate crisis intensifies. The United States’ patchwork energy quilt will need dramatic reform to meet the challenges of both decarbonization and the extreme weather ahead. And unfortunately, the political response to Texas’s crisis so far shows how hard fossil fuel interests will fight to keep the current system in place.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/el-paso-electric-winter-storm-2021/"><strong>El Paso Heeded the Warnings and Avoided a Winter Catastrophe</strong></a> (Texas Monthly) — “<em>Being part of the Western Interconnect, El Paso Electric has an additional incentive to winterize because it’s part of an interstate network and can sell excess energy out-of-state during winter months, says Ramanan Krishnamoorti, the chief energy officer at the University of Houston, who is an expert on energy systems. On the other hand, most Texas power generators actually have a disincentive to make expensive modifications to prepare for a once-in-a-blue-moon winter storm. ‘Winterizing is a significant cost. Moreover, if you make energy a scarcity, then you can charge more,’ Krishnamoorti said. ‘It’s a very cynical way of looking at it, but in the end, it is a marketplace.’”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/now-they-love-her/Content?oid=86338723"><strong>Now They Love Her</strong></a> (Chicago Reader) — <em>An obituary for one of this era’s great labor leaders, who recently passed away.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/liberals-choosing-convenience/617934/"><strong>Liberals Are Choosing Convenience Over Workers</strong></a></strong> (The Atlantic) — <em>“Executives and owners regard Prop 22 as an obvious win: By replacing their workforces with third-party contractors, they’ll see labor costs go down and profit margins go up. Workers, however, will find no silver lining. Full-time jobs will disappear, and fired employees who take jobs with DoorDash or a similar company will face much harsher working conditions, without overtime pay, sick leave, protections against workplace discrimination, the ability to form a union, or eligibility for state unemployment insurance...Five Big Tech companies bankrolled the $200 million ‘Yes on Prop. 22’ campaign, but the idea has deep roots in the Democratic Party and in American liberalism as a whole.”</em></p>

Though his poll numbers have yet to significantly decline, the prestige media that spent so long propping him up has now turned. Even if Cuomo never sinks low enough to lose reelection next year — given his enormous war chest and New York’s horrific campaign finance laws, it’s still an unlikely scenario — he will never again be the governor feted by Ellen and celebrated by self-described “Cuomosexuals.” He’s not getting another Emmy. His moment is over.”</em></p>

Then He Lost His Job.</strong></a> (Philadelphia Inquirer) — <em>An important story about recently defeated Pennsylvania State Treasurer Joe Torsella, who used his position to try to expose how Wall Street fleeces state pension systems. “Torsella asked to see investment contracts and fee deals with outside money managers — and was told they were not public. It was as if they were somehow more confidential than a town paving contract or a sanitation worker’s salary. He found out that these financial managers were actually collecting much more than the systems had disclosed. He learned that the funds’ staff traveled the globe to keep track of investments, with their airfare and hotels booked by the money managers — and very little of that was public, too. In sum, Torsella said, he found that the pension plans, especially the teachers’ fund, treated Wall Street as a close partner rather than as a hired servant.”</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://defector.com/the-march-of-the-american-kooks/"><strong>The March Of The American Kooks</strong></a></strong> (Defector) — <em>“For all the clammy and overdetermined machinations by the aspirants to Trump’s throne, it is plain to see which people in our politics are most authentically like him. The new congressional Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn and Lauren Boebert take after Trump in their thirst and strident idiocy, but mostly in their understanding that their jobs are to sell, and complain, and post and post and post, and never to disclaim any of the lazy suspicions and secondhand gripes and idle vendettas out of which they’ve fashioned their public selves. As with Trump, the goal is in one sense more about presence than power; as also with Trump, and with Schilling, the obligation to that thirst runs far deeper than the ridiculous outward presentation would suggest.”</em></p>

It’s that millions of otherwise ordinary people from many walks of life—including many who went to and even excelled in college—have a material or ideological interest in keeping the Democratic Party and its voters from power by any means possible. And those means include the utilization of narratives, including conspiracy theories, that delegitimize Democrats and offer hope of their eventual comeuppance.”</em></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota"><strong>A message from Sirota</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This was a truly landmark week for <em>The Daily Poster</em> and the accountability journalism that you make possible by being a supporting subscriber.</p>
<p>As you may recall, while corporate media outlets spent last year <a href="__GHOST_URL__/cuomo-and-the-lincoln-project-are/">lauding</a> Cuomo, we have been investigating how Cuomo helped major industry donors shield nursing home executives from legal consequences, and then withheld information about thousands of nursing home deaths. This isn’t just a New York story — as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/exclusive-states-are-copying-and/"><em>The Daily Poster</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/exclusive-states-are-copying-and/"> first reported</a>, Cuomo’s corporate immunity law subsequently went national.</p>
<p>This scandal is now engulfing New York as Cuomo reportedly faces a <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Cuomo-15957401.php">federal law enforcement probe</a> — and our reporting has been a big part of exposing the back-room machinations. You don’t have to believe me about that. Believe Assemblyman Ron Kim, the New York Democratic lawmaker who is now allegedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/nyregion/nursing-homes-cuomo-ron-kim.html">facing retribution</a> from Cuomo for demanding answers about the questions our stories raised:</p>

<p>Another New York Democratic lawmaker demanding answers also publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/yuhline/status/1362808258285744133">thanked</a><em>The Daily Poster</em> “for continuously asking for the numbers and covering what is happening in our nursing homes and hospitals and keeping us informed.”</p>
<p>You can read our reporting series <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/exclusive-states-are-copying-and/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-senate-gop-copied-and-pasted-25d/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ny-dems-created-mcconnells-corporate/">here</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/health-care-lobby-tries-to-buy-corporate/">here</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lawmakers-unify-to-give-corporate/">here</a>. You’ll see that we are holding the powerful accountable — and we can only do so because we are completely independent and grassroots funded by our readers.</p>
<p>When we started <em>The Daily Poster</em>, we had a vision of building an independent news organization funded by readers that would let us challenge power in ways that corporate media won’t.</p>
<p>This week, we can all see proof that our vision is fast becoming a reality, and it is becoming a reality because you are part of the team. We absolutely could not do this work without the support of our subscribers — so thank you for pitching in and making this work possible. Together, we are making a big impact.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
