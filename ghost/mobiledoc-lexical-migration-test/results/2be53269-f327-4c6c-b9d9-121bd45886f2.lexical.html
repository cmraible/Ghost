<p><em>One Man & His Blog</em> is the personal weblog of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Tinworth" title="Adam Tinworth">Adam Tinworth</a>. I’ve been using it to explore the intersection of digital technology, publishing and journalism for well over 18 years – and it’s where I continue to think out loud as part of my consultancy work.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I’ve been a journalist for 25 years and a blogger for nearly two decades. Since 2006 I’ve been working-full time in digital journalism and publishing development, and I have extensive experience of change management, workflows, and technology implementation.</p>
<p>I also deliver training of journalists, publishers and other content-centric people from students up to senior management level.</p>
<p>Since 2012, I’ve been working independently as a consultant on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height: 1.618;">publishing strategy</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height: 1.618;">digital journalism</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height: 1.618;">mobile</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height: 1.618;">social media.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>My clients have ranged from international magazine publishers, to national newspapers like the <em>Financial Times</em> and <em>The Telegraph</em>, to small businesses. I’m more interested in the challenge of the work than the size of the client.</p>
<p>I’m also a visiting lecturer at City, University of London where I teach digital journalism and <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/postgraduate/interactive-journalism">audience engagement skills</a> to Masters students, including video strategy, social media, community management, SEO and audience strategy.</p>
