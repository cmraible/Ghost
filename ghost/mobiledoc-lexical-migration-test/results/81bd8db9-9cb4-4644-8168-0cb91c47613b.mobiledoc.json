As different model lines age out, Lamborghini will often churn out several special editions to commemorate the good times, so that’s not shocking at all. However, it sounds like the powers that be in Sant ’Agata Bolognese have some especially interesting ideas in mind to send the Huracan out with a bang."

It took the Huracan EVO and increased the ride height, modified the suspension, fine-tuned the LDVI system for off-road conditions, increased the track width, added underbody reinforcements/protections, added auxiliary LED lights, etc. Such a car would provide another kind of high-speed, off-road experience you won’t get with a Ford Raptor."

While that would be something we’ve already seen instead of “something different” it would be easy for the automaker to pull off. After all, the Gallardo Tecnica added carbon-ceramic brakes, a rear wing, and flashy new colors. People really ate that up, so it would make sense for the Italian automaker to do it again."
