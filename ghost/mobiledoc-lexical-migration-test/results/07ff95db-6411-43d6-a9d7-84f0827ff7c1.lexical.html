<p>Built by Rides by Kam and owned by Robert Zahabi from Queensland, Australia, the Havoc Challenger is no stranger to us at Motorious. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/restomods-on-motorious/">This restomod</a> is one of the most impressive classic Dodge Challenger builds we’ve ever seen, and Barrett-Jackson seems to agree. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/havoc-is-a-bagged/">Havoc Challenger</a> recently earned the title of “Ultimate Best in Show” by Barrett-Jackson.</p>

<p>“This year’s Barrett-Jackson Cup Competition was a testament to the level of talent of today’s custom coachbuilders,” said Steve Davis. “Over the past few years since we first hosted the Barrett-Jackson Cup, we’ve seen a tremendous surge of talent and vision take life in these custom builds. I am so honored to be a part of giving these Cup entrants the recognition they deserve. Congratulation to our winner, finalists and all of our entrants.”</p>
