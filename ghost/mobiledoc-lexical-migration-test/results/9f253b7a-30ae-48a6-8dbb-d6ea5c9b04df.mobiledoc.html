<p>Usually, by the fourth incarnation in an automotive franchise, the lineage has lost its way. Often a shadow of the original mantra, by the time a nomenclature reaches its middle-aged spread, most of the spark has gone. Arguably, we don’t feel this vehicular stereotype fits the <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28164/1969-chevrolet-impala?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Chevrolet Impala</a>. <br><br><em><strong>More Chevrolets!</strong></em><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/camaro-copo-427-rotisserie-restoration">Chevrolet’s Special Order 427Ci Secret Weapon: COPO</a><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/only-six-of-these-top-whack-1969-chevrolet-biscaynes-ever-existed">Only Six Of These Top Whack 1969 Chevrolet Biscaynes Ever Existed</a></p>
<p>Redesigned in 1965, and in production until 1970, the fourth-gen Impala set an all-time industry annual sales record; exceeding one million units in the North American market. They were <em>everywhere</em>. In fact, the 65-70 GM B platform remains the fourth best-selling car platform in history, after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T and Lada Riva.</p>

<p><br>Stylistically, the new body featured a sharper windshield and redesigned vent windows, alongside revamped full-coil suspension; small changes on paper, but the sales figures and subsequent legacy speak for themselves. Consequent models don’t appear to boast such high regard with collectors. However, we believe their time will come. <br><br>Finding a good example of any 65- 70 Impala won’t take long, but this particular specimen – <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28164/1969-chevrolet-impala?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a 1969 droptop offered by GAA Classic Cars </a>– jumps at us more than most. Powered along by a 350 CID engine mated to an automatic transmission, this white beauty also features an upgraded radio and sound system that’s hidden under the driver’s seat, with the original system still intact should you prefer a dose of retro static.</p>
