Still, the amount of investments in renewables are three to six times below what they need to be this decade, Kahn writes. However, while most technology is being developed and adopted faster than anticipated, nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage have been the exception to this rule. These technologies “have seen minimal cost reductions and their adoption has grown slowly,” according to the IPCC."
