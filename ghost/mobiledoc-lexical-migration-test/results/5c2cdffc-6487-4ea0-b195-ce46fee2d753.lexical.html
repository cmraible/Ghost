<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pro-business-law-and-economics-interests-pushed-the-courts-right/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-anti-abortion-crusade-for-the-filibuster/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
