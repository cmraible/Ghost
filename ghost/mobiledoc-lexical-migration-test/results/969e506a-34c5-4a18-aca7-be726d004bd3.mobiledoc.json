In fact, the ‘Vette in question was tracked down to Ohio where it resides with its current owner who has had it since the early 1980s."

This business of crying wolf to collect insurance money not only increases insurance rates for everyone, it victimizes the people who are targeted by thieves. While Treece hasn’t been found guilty, if he is we hope a clear message is sent to anyone thinking this kind of crime is a good idea."
