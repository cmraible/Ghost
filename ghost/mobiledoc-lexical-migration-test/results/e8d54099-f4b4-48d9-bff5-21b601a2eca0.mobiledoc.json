The different ways for you to mow down your enemies ensures that the combat never gets stale, and the way the force manifests in combat scenarios feels very intuitive and simple. The lightsaber mechanics are a little “hack and slash” repetitive but it doesn’t really bring the experience down at all because, for the most part, using your lightsaber is optional. The enemies you face are incredibly diverse as well: apart from the usual armor-clad baddies, there are a plethora of aliens and force users to test your powers against. In addition to having probably the only enjoyable quick-time events ever, the scale, aesthetics and character moments embedded into the boss fights make them truly noteworthy, not just for a "

Almost every planet is revisited more than once along your journey, but worst of all, you have to return to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which was pretty cool the first time, for a minimum of three missions. The only reason this level was cool the first time is because of the lore attached to the name, because in terms of level design, it’s the most cookie-cutter of all locations: beige walls and hallways filled with statues. At the very least, the other planets felt like cool sci-fi set pieces in a way The Jedi Temple just doesn’t. This fact is even more annoying since there’s a lack of satisfying motivation for you to return to these locations; it’s often justified by vague orders from Darth Vader or an equally vague “feeling” the protagonist has.

This bit of Felucia looks exactly the same as that bit over there, so why would I go over there? If it wasn’t for the collectible items, there would be no reason to deviate from the beaten path in what little opportunity there is, and since the collectibles are Korok-seed-under-a-random-rock levels of tedium most of the time, there’s no motivation to look for them because apart from a slightly different coloured lightsaber or a sense of rigid completionism, there’s no fun in looking for things.

I’d like to clarify before I go any further, this is not a complaint about the mere presence of a romantic storyline or a knock against the performances which were overall great; the problem is the female lead, Juno, seemingly only exists to be a so-called love interest for the protagonist. The game tells us that she’s a badass Imperial combat pilot, but we never get to see her do anything. She sits in the ship and waits for Starkiller to come back from his most recent massacre and chauffeurs him around the galaxy. Her presence in cutscenes is fairly minimal (although when she does get some meaty dialogue, all of twice it ever happens, the actress kills it) and (spoilers) when the romance is revealed at the end of the game, it’s sincerely jarring. At least we get moments of development for Starkiller within the missions because he gets to talk to people outside the ship. Juno is used as a prop in this game, and both the actress and character deserved better. The droid helper gets better characterisation than our romantic lead, which is a big problem. "

          " was something I was really excited for, but the experience itself was bittersweet. This is a game that somehow holds up enough to be fun, but shows its age enough that a modern audience is likely going to be slightly disappointed by its limitations. No matter how fun and varied the combat is, the bottlenecked nature of the level design is going to feel very constricting. Even though most of the story still reads well and is superbly acted by the entire cast, the tacked on romance and poor characterisation of the romantic lead is going to leave the audience unsatisfied.
