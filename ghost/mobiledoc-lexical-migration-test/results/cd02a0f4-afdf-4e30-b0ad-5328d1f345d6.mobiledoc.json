          "On July 5 at about 3:30 pm a Dodge Challenger that was speeding through Detroit ran a stop light, violently colliding with a Dodge Journey. That Mopar muscle car was stolen and immediately after the crash the occupants jumped out, making a run for it before police arrived. A man who witnessed the collision tried to get the men to stay on the scene, reportedly grabbing a 21-year-old passenger, who pulled out a gun and shot the good Samaritan."

          "As the man sustained a fatal wound, he pulled out his own gun and returned fire, striking the 21-year-old but not fatally. While police praised the good Samaritan for stopping to help, they also urged the public to be cautious in such situations. Trying to physically stop criminals as they flee from a scene is incredibly dangerous for anyone."

While they all survived, a nine-year-old suffered multiple broken bones. Seeing a group of guys hurt children and then try to run off instead of taking responsibility is enough to make anyone’s blood boil."

Lalone said the following about the awful situation: \"Absolutely, he is a Good Samaritan, it's a horrible, horrible incident he's a good person and we appreciate him stopping. We need witnesses more than ever again write down descriptions, routes to travel, things like that but to approach a suspect it's always dangerous and we ask not to do that.\""
