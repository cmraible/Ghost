<p>Nine months ago, <em>The Daily Poster</em> began publishing a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">deep-dive</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/ny-dems-created-mcconnells-corporate/">series</a> documenting how large campaign donations flowed from health care industry interests to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and then he passed legislation granting helping those interests shield nursing home executives from legal consequences for their profit-maximizing decisions during the pandemic. Now, a new must-read <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-covid-cuomo-nursing-homes-donations-immunity-20210224-3zbcgphqynco7leqwkuhh4ssri-story.html"><em>New York Daily News</em></a><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-covid-cuomo-nursing-homes-donations-immunity-20210224-3zbcgphqynco7leqwkuhh4ssri-story.html"> report</a> shows how those facts are taking center stage in the scandal engulfing Cuomo and New York politics.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• BIDEN BREAKS KEY PROMISE TO TEACHERS: </strong>Over a year ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/JamaalBowmanNY/status/1364734899433992198?s=20">Joe Biden promised</a> that if elected president, he would end standardized testing requirements in public schools. But <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/standardized-testing-education-department-2021/">Biden announced</a> this week that he will not allow states to cancel standardized testing amid the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2021/2/22/22296173/biden-administration-state-tests">prompting backlash</a> from teachers unions.</p>
<p><strong>• NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE PUBLIC OPTION:</strong> “At the federal level, I believe it will be hard to pass a public option at this point," Lauren Crawford Shaver, a <a href="https://www.ahip.org/speaker/lauren-crawford-shaver/">former Hillary Clinton staffer</a> who leads the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, <a href="https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/medicare-for-all-merely-a-talking-point-partnership-exec-says">said Wednesday</a>. Shaver’s front group — funded by health insurers, drugmakers, and investor-owned hospital chains — has been campaigning against the public option and just bought new TV ad spots this week in Maine, Montana, and the Washington area, as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-gift-health-insurance/"><em>The Daily Poster</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-gift-health-insurance/"> reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>• TEXAS REPUBLICANS HAVE IT ALL WRONG: </strong>The Republicans who run state politics in Texas have <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-republicans-priorities-energy-grid_n_60353af4c5b6cc8bbf3eda06">put more energy</a> into making sure the national anthem is played at public events than regulating their own energy grid, leaving their constituents with widespread blackouts last week. In fact, deregulating the state’s energy system has cost ratepayers in the state <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-electric-bills-were-28-billion-higher-under-deregulation-11614162780">over $28 billion</a> over the past two decades. State lawmakers, refusing to take the blame, are doubling down on fossil fuels, when they should really be recognizing that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/opinion/green-new-deal-texas-blackout.html">time for a Green New Deal.</a></p>
<p><strong>• FORMER CUOMO AIDE SPEAKS OUT: </strong>“Governor Andrew Cuomo has created a culture within his administration where sexual harassment and bullying is so pervasive that it is not only condoned but expected,” wrote Lindsey Boylan, a former aide to Cuomo, in a <a href="https://medium.com/@lindseyboylan4NY/my-story-of-working-with-governor-cuomo-e664d4814b4e">Medium post</a> yesterday detailing how Cuomo sexually harassed her and her colleagues. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie called the allegations <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/24/lindsey-boylan-cuomo-sexual-harassment/">“serious”</a> and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/540497-de-blasio-calls-for-investigation-into-sexual-harassment-allegations">calling for</a> an investigation. Cuomo <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/25/politics/andrew-cuomo-lindsey-boylan-allegation/index.html">is denying</a> the allegations.</p>
