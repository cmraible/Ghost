Their style combined with a laundry list of accomplishments on the racing circuit have made it quite formidable in that area. All of this culminated to a climax somewhere in the late 1980s and 1990s, particularly with their 911 series cars. One such example could be this 1989 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe G 50 but that should be something that you could decide yourself. After all, you might just end up being the next driver."

To put it simply, this is a driver‘s car which was built with the specific purpose of severely enriching its operator's life. This is very clearly shown with the G 55 speed manual transaxle which gives the driver full control over the car's acceleration and handling capabilities. Without a doubt, it’s a gearbox that truly lives up to its reputation among car people across the nation."

Of course, you can’t really beat the sound of a thumping flat-six powertrain from one of Germany’s premium track car producers. Overall, this Porsche is a wonderful combination of style and speed with heritage unlike anything else. That’s exactly why you should consider it for your automotive collection."
