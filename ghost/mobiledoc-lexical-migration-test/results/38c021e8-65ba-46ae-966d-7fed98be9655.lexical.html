<p>According to a local investigative report, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">police officer</a> responding to a shots fired call in Baton Rouge, Louisiana only to end up <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-theft-thwarted/">taking a joyride</a> in a Dodge Charger. That might sound bizarre to most people, but for car enthusiasts it’s not nearly as big of a stretch. Still, there’s more to the story than just a police officer shirking his duties to try out a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">powerful American muscle car</a>.</p>
<p>We say powerful because the report did mention the Charger in question features the 6.2-liter Hemi V8. That’s a relief, because if the officer had gotten that excited about a V6 Charger we wouldn’t be the least bit impressed. Let’s just be honest here: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">real muscle cars</a> have V8s, period.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, this wasn’t a case of a police officer being tempted by some Mopar owner wanting him to drive the car to get out of trouble. The report of shots fired was quickly determined to be someone <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/neighbor-complains-about/">mistaking the sound of the Dodge Charger for a gun</a>. Once police realized there was no violent threat, that’s when the one officer took the car for a spin without permission from the owner. If that were our vehicle we’d be furious, even if it were some jalopy.</p>
<p>Apparently, the incident in question took place earlier in the year, but the officer involved wasn’t disciplined until later and the reason was that his body camera battery was low. He was reportedly given a light discipline and that was that, instead of Internal Affairs charging him with unauthorized use of a movable, which would’ve carried a much more serious consequence.</p>
<p>Before you start saying all cops are scum and such, know that the person who turned this officer in was a fellow officer. His coworkers who were no the scene reportedly were shocked he would do such a thing and we have a feeling a fair number of them believe he got off way too easy, even if they won’t admit that in public. Law enforcement should be held to a higher standard when it comes to using private property without permission, so this whole incident was just plain inexcusable.</p>
