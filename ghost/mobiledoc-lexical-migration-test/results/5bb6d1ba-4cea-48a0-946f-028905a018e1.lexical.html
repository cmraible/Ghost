<hr>
<p>Just like so many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-1970-plymouth-cuda-drag-car-hemi/">Mopar enthusiasts</a> out there today, for Frank Badalson, it all started with a 1968 Road Runner. All it took was a glimpse of the car and all he could think about was getting behind the wheel of one and when it came time to pick up his first ride, he went straight to Mopar and never looked back. His first, a 1973 ‘<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/barn-find-1970-plymouth-cuda-roller-under-11k/">Cuda</a> with a 2-barrel 318 locked in his obsession and in 1975 he bought his first Hemi. A 1971 ‘Cuda that was sold 41 years later at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-miles/">Mecum</a> for $1,000,000.</p>

<p>Dealing with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/is-harley-davidson-on-its-last-leg/">Harley-Davidson motorcycle</a> fraud in the 1970s was quite an issue for local law enforcement, and in 1976 the FBI taught a class on how to collect and process engine and frame numbers off of Harleys. Working on the force at the time, Badalson attended that class and immediately applied what he learned to what was then just a hobby of collecting Hemis. It was this skill paired with a cataloging ability that turned a hobby into a profession for Badalson.</p>
