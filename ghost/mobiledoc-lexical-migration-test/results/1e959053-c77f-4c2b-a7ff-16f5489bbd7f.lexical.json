I&#8217;m working to gather more information on it as of now.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bringing us to now, their source had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>I was told January 10th from one source. This hasn&#8217;t been cross checked between sources. Most of my other sources are still undecided on an exact date, but certain of a Nintendo January Direct.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t all that surprising to hear that a Nintendo Direct will be happening this month as the Big N generally have Directs to kick-start the year. That being said, January 10th is only a week away and we can&#8217;t help but get excited!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Do you think we&#8217;ll be seeing a Nintendo Direct on January 10th?
