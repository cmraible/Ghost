Like the jeep, these bikes have been considered “the motorcycle that won the War” as they were instrumental both in the European and Pacific Theaters. However, just like the toll on human during WWII, many of these two-wheeled heroes were also ruined, never to be ridden again. With drained military resources as the US government turned its attention to peacekeeping in Europe and domestic issues after the fall of the Third Reich and Imperial Japan, it became necessary for the Army to use what it already had on hand when President Truman pushed for the UN to become involved in the exploding Korean conflict."

Not all the bikes were used up during the war, so the military sold off many as government surplus, as well as the spare parts. These were scooped up and often chopped by veterans, a movement many credit for the birth of the outlaw-oriented motorcycle culture in America."

WLAs used in WWII which were manufactured after Pearl Harbor all bear a “42” at the beginning of their serial number, those used in Korea carry the year of their manufacture, such as “49.”"

          "While the WLA was based on the R series, they were unique in many ways. Most notably, the military motorcycles featured special black-out lighting for riding covertly at night, leg shields, a skidplate, and an ammunition box. Since these were designed for serious trailblazing in the Korean backcountry, the forks were 2.5 inches longer for improved ground clearance. While several different fender designs were used, all were wider and featured greater clearance space to allow mud to be ejected instead of accumulating. Harley also included a more robust toolkit than what was sold with civilian motorcycles since field repairs could be a matter of life or death. Firearm scabbards weren’t installed in the factory, but they are an obvious feature not found on most civilian bikes."

          "Many other motorcycles which had been prominent in WWII faded into obscurity during the Korean War. In part, that was due to the proficient capabilities of jeeps, which were instrumental in traversing the notoriously rugged Korean Peninsula. Also, the use of helicopters in warfare soared in Korea, offering more transportation solutions in difficult terrain. In other words, while Harley-Davidson boasted the only significant 2-wheeled contribution to the war effort, modern innovations were changing how we as a nation fought."
