<p>If you’re a fan of the old Top Gear trio, also known as the current The Grand Tour cast, then you’ll care about Richard Hammond finally wrapping up the restoration of his Jaguar XK150. If you’re not a fan, maybe you’re wondering what all the hubbub is about. Well, the car is a real classic, a British beauty, so naturally Hammond screwed it up and had to pay people to fix it.</p>

<p>Well, Hammond was already paying a crew to restore the car. While the TV personality drives a lot of cool cars, he’s certainly not a mechanic or a restoration specialist of any type. He also seems to lack some sense because the man was so excited about the classic Jaguar looking so great, he took it on a vacation to France even though it mechanically wasn’t completely sorted.</p>

<p>Laugh if you must, because it’s funny, especially since Hammond’s mechanic tried to talk sense into the guy. Instead, the differential acted up and the car in general wasn’t performing as it should. He’s lucky he wasn’t stranded in the middle of the French countryside.</p>
<p>Anyway, after literally paying for that mistake the Jag is finally ready to actually enjoy. Sure, it took the better part of this year, but as the old saying goes you can either have it quickly or have it done correctly.</p>

<p>If you watch the included video, it’s obvious great attention was paid to every detail on this XK150 and the results are breathtaking. Even if you’re not a Jaguar fan (which I’m not) you have to admit this is a beautiful car, one which you would absolutely stop and admire anywhere.</p>
<p>Hammond seems to have a blast driving it in peak condition. It’s probably way more entertaining than when the mechanicals were ailing – who would’ve thought? The video’s pretty interesting and it’s short, so check it out and learn more about this classic Jaguar.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yi2_HY9nf9E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
