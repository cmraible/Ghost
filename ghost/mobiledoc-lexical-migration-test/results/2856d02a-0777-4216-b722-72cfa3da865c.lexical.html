<p>While the Democratic and Republican parties have not made climate action a priority this election season, Big Oil is on the offensive at the state level, spending big to control the narrative.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs at stake for Big Oil on November 8? Which key low-profile but high-stakes offices are fossil fuel companies spending on ‚Äî and who are the top recipients of all those dirty funds?</p>
<p>In this edition of Election Insider, exclusively for supporting subscribers, we break down the big climate races and power players spending to control the climate agenda.</p>
<h3 id="five-important-gubernatorial-big-oil-recipients">Five Important Gubernatorial Big Oil Recipients </h3>
<p>On October 6, three West Coast governors and the Canadian Premier of British Columbia signed a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23126613-10622-pcc-statement-of-cooperation">pact</a> to make the region ‚Äî which boasts <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/10/06/west-coast-leaders-double-down-on-bold-actions-to-fight-climate-crisis/">57 million people</a> and a combined GDP of $3.5 trillion ‚Äî the first area on the continent to transition to 100-percent clean electricity and a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>The actions of governors, in other words, have extensive impacts on climate change, and for meaningful transformation to happen, the number of states slashing carbon emissions must grow. That cannot happen when gubernatorial elections are being won by candidates taking in vast sums of fossil fuel money, as we highlight below.</p>

    <li>In the 2022 cycle, Texas Gov. <strong>Greg Abbott </strong>has<strong></strong>raked in <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=11281947">$16.5 million</a> from Big Oil and Gas, including more than <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&c-t-eid=11281947&d-eid=1752535">$3.5 million</a> from Texas <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/major-texas-oil-donor-emerges-this-cycle-who-is-he/">oil mogul</a><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/18/greg-abbott-texas-fundraising-governor-donors/">Syed Javaid Anwar</a>, who has made a fortune from shale fracking and has emerged as a top oil and gas donor to candidates who support the fossil fuel industry. In total, Abbott has taken more than $34 million in fossil fuel donations throughout his political career ‚Äî and the results have shown in his actions. In 2021, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-28-million-is-behind/">Abbott</a><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/">blamed</a> Texas‚Äô rolling power outages on green energy despite the state‚Äôs reliance on fossil fuels. After President Joe Biden called for stricter regulations on greenhouse gas methane in January 2021, Abbott <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-issues-executive-order-relating-to-protection-of-texass-energy-industry-from-federal-overreach">ordered</a> Texas to ‚Äúuse all lawful powers and tools to challenge any federal action that threatens the continued strength, vitality and independence of the energy industry.‚Äù</li>
    <li>Texas Lieutenant Governor <strong>Dan Patrick</strong> has taken <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=11860515">$3.5 million</a> in fossil fuel donations this cycle, and nearly <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&f-eid=11860515&f-fc=2&d-cci=33">$9 million</a> over his political career. Patrick was a major proponent of the state‚Äôs Oil & Gas Investment Protection Act, <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/dan-patrick-blackrock-investments/">lambasting</a> ‚Äúgreen‚Äù Wall Street firms <a href="https://www.ltgov.texas.gov/2022/01/19/lt-gov-dan-patrick-letter-to-comptroller-hegar-to-place-blackrock-at-the-top-of-the-list-of-financial-companies-that-boycott-the-texas-oil-gas-industry/">that</a> ‚Äúboycott‚Äù the oil and gas industry while declaring that he is ‚Äúcommitted to ensuring Texas is the top state for oil and gas in America.‚Äù</li>
    <li><strong>Mark Ronchetti</strong>, a Republican candidate for Governor of New Mexico, has taken nearly <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=54852743#[%7B1%7Cgro=">$750,000</a> from oil and gas <a href="https://ladailypost.com/oil-gas-money-continues-to-be-primary-source-of-campaign-contributions-in-new-mexico/">while</a><a href="https://markronchetti.com/gubernatorial-candidate-mark-ronchetti-takes-on-mlg-biden-in-new-tv-ad/">saying</a> he will ‚Äúunleash New Mexico energy‚Äù and fight freezes on federal oil and gas drilling leases across the United States. That money could have an outsized impact on the climate crisis, thanks to New Mexico‚Äôs historically weak enforcement of the fossil fuel industry, and the counterproductive consequences of Democrats‚Äô Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). According to a recent <em>Capital & Main <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/strongest-climate-bill-ever-may-increase-oil-and-gas-production-in-new-mexico">report</a></em>, the IRA has reduced certain land protections and positioned New Mexico‚Äôs unleased federal land as a prime target for the fossil fuel industry. Oil and gas production accounts for <a href="https://www.climateaction.nm.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NMClimateChange_2021_final.pdf">more than half</a> of the state‚Äôs climate change emissions, which are <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/uncontrolled-burning-the-role-of-oil-and-gas-in-new-mexicos-historic-wildfires#:~:text=one%20Chevron%20lobbyist%20doled%20out">driving</a> the state's historic wildfires.</li>
    <li>Florida Gov. <strong>Ron DeSantis </strong>has brought in <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=17657831">$695,000</a> from oil and gas this cycle. Roughly <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=17657831#[%7B1%7Cgro=d-id">$100,000</a> of that money came from the petroleum refining company First Coast Energy ‚Äî whose CEO, Aubrey Edge, Desantis <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2020/01/31/governor-ron-desantis-appoints-two-to-the-board-of-governors-of-the-state-university-system/">appointed</a> to the board of governors of Florida‚Äôs state university system. In 2021, Desantis <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/23/florida-governor-bill-thfossil-fuels/">signed</a> some of the country‚Äôs most draconian laws prohibiting local governments from banning fossil fuels and switching to clean energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Betsy Johnson,</strong> an independent running for Governor in Oregon, has taken about <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=56898982">$240,000</a> from fossil fuel and logging companies. While that might not seem like much money, it‚Äôs atop a mammoth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/15/us/politics/kotek-drazan-oregon-governor.html">$3.75 million</a> Johnson has raked in from Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/15/us/politics/kotek-drazan-oregon-governor.html">targeted</a> Democratic candidate Tina Kotek because of his disdain for a supposedly leftward lurch in the state‚Äôs government. Thanks to that hefty sum, for the first time in 40 years, the GOP is poised to capture the Governor‚Äôs office in Oregon, as the latest polls show how Johnson is acting as a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/15/politics/oregon-governor-election-kotek-drazan-johnson">spoiler candidate</a>, giving Republican candidate Christine Drazan an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oregon/">edge</a> in a tight race. That would be very bad for the environment: Drazan will <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/10/to-protect-constituents-the-timber-industry-betsy-johnson-repeatedly-voted-against-ambitious-climate-change-policy.html">prioritize</a> the interests of logging companies, and <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/09/16/oregon-governor-race-candidates-climate-change-global-warming-elections-2022/">plans on</a> rolling back Oregon‚Äôs commitments to reducing air pollution.</li>

<h3 id="big-oil%E2%80%99s-favorite-state-level-candidates">Big Oil‚Äôs Favorite State-Level Candidates</h3>
<p>State-level executive officers have tremendous power over environmental issues. Here‚Äôs a rundown of the fossil fuel and energy industry‚Äôs involvement in five state races that will shape how states manage energy transitions.</p><!--members-only-->
<ol>
    <li>Republican<strong> Wayne Christian</strong>, incumbent candidate for ‚Äã‚Äãchairman of the <a href="https://www.rrc.texas.gov/about-us/">Texas Railroad Commission</a>, has taken nearly <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=6582583">$1.3 million</a> from oil and gas. That‚Äôs because in Texas, the Railroad Commission is responsible for regulating the fossil fuel industry. The <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/texas-would-profit-from-bidens-climate-bill-but-politicians-prefer-cheap-plentiful-fossil-fuels">commission</a> oversees the permitting of oil and gas projects, monitors how drilling complies with regulations, and manages pipelines and oil and gas emergency response. Christian has been an outspoken advocate for the fossil fuel industry, frequently writing op-eds in <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/opinion/commentary/article/oil-gas-regulation-light-prices-low-17026280.php">favor</a> of light regulations, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.mrt.com/opinion/article/RRC-Chair-Stop-Biden-from-ending-Texas-oil-and-16871850.php">fighting</a> against radical policies like the Green New Deal and Paris Climate Agreement,‚Äù and pushing <a href="https://www.caller.com/story/opinion/forums/2021/10/01/forum-texas-carbon-capture-technology-should-expanded/5932469001/">carbon capture</a> technologies, which have been called little more than a fossil fuel handout.</li>
    <li>Republican Texas Attorney General<strong> Ken Paxton</strong> is running for re-election for his third four-year term, and he has received more than <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=6599313">$730,000</a> from fossil fuels. An aggressive <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/paxton-defeats-biden-administrations-oil-and-gas-leasing-moratorium-public-lands-marking-major-win">opponent</a> to the Biden Administration‚Äôs moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal public lands, Attorney General Paxton represents the state in matters pertaining to environmental protection, natural resources, and public utilities. Currently, the Texas Bar is <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/projects/2022/houston-texas-voter-guide-november/">suing</a> to disbar Paxton for filing false information in a case regarding Trump‚Äôs false claims of a stolen election, and such legal troubles have placed him in what is now a <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Why-Ken-Paxton-vs-Rochelle-Garza-for-attorney-17234186.php">tight race</a> against the civil rights lawyer Rochelle Garza.</li>
    <li>Texas Land Commissioner Republican candidate <strong>Dawn Buckingham</strong> has taken more than <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&f-fc=2&d-cci=33&f-eid=13725875">$120,000</a> from corporations like Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The land commissioner is supposed to preserve wildlife and manage 13 million acres of state land, much of which sits on the state's coastline in the Gulf of Mexico. The office is also responsible for <a href="https://therealdeal.com/texas/2022/05/11/texas-gave-none-of-its-federal-disaster-funds-to-most-vulnerable-communities-hud-investigation-finds/">managing</a> natural disaster relief funding, including billions of dollars Congress appropriated to Texas after Hurricane Harvey in 2017. On her <a href="https://dawnbuckingham.com/">website</a>, however, Buckingham says she will ‚Äúunleash Texas energy and fight the Green New Deal.‚Äù</li>
    <li><strong>Mike</strong><strong>Francis</strong> is running for re-election to the Louisiana Public Service Commission ‚Äî an agency that regulates utilities ‚Äî and has taken <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&law-exi=1&law-oc=Z05,Z36,Z57&law-y=2022&d-ccg=5#[%7B1%7Cgro=f-eid">$80,000</a> from energy companies. Public utility commissioners, broadly speaking, act as gatekeepers to clean energy and have tremendous control over how and whether states make just and green transitions away from fossil fuels. Only 11 states elect their commissioners, and because these races typically fly under the radar, donations have a big impact. Last month, Francis, a Republican, <a href="https://www.kalb.com/2022/08/26/district-4-psc-commissioner-mike-francis-discusses-cleco-backlash-over-aug-15-billing-cycle-issues/">faced</a> backlash from Louisianans over high electric bills charged by the for-profit, investor-owned electric utility Cleco. Francis has <a href="http://www.westcentralsbest.com/todays_country_1057/news/mike-francis-speaks-out-against-allegations/article_6d34f710-38f2-11ed-aba4-7bc80ba4927f.html">taken</a> as much as $9,000 in donations from Cleco coffers, and he has argued that lowering the electricity bills would <a href="http://www.westcentralsbest.com/957_krok/psc-mike-francis-says-energy-companies-have-to-answer-to-stockholders/article_9389c01a-2fb7-11ed-9d3c-afc4a1f83f99.html">mean</a> pulling money out of shareholders‚Äô pockets. </li>
    <li><strong>Lambert Boissiere III</strong>, a Democrat, is running for re-election for a fourth six-year term to the Louisiana Public Service Commission and has taken <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&y=2022,2021&law-exi=1&law-oc=Z05,Z36,Z57&law-y=2022&d-ccg=5#[%7B1%7Cgro=f-eid">$36,000</a> from energy firms like Atmos, Cleco, and Valero ‚Äî companies he is supposed to be regulating. Boisseiere‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_d981f97e-4bdd-11ed-bf9d-67733fc00e3f.html">challengers</a><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/5-state-level-races-that-could-alter-the-energy-transition/">argue</a> that dirty money is inhibiting the state‚Äôs transition to renewables and low energy energy costs.</li>
