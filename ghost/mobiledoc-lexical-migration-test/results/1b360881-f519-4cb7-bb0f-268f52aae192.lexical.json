Get mad at Stellantis and while you’re at it give Ford, BMW, Volvo, and Honda a piece of your mind since those automakers have been at the forefront of sacrificing automotive performance on the altar of climate alarmism. If automakers said no and pushed back against this insanity, it would be over quickly. Instead, Tim Kuniskis and other auto executives play the game, throw up their hands, and say there’s nothing they can do once the government tells them how it’s going to be. You’re being played and the price is you can kiss V8s goodbye as you pay more for less power and eventually have to wait in an hours-long line to plug in your “muscle car” so you can drive another 200 miles on a road trip which used to take you a few hours and is now a two-day trek.
