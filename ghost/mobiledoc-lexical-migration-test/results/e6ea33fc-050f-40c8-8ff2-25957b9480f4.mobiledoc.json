          "So often, people take a special car they were driving regularly and stick it in the old barn, shed, garage, or wherever else with the intention of fixing something wrong with it. But then life happens, they might procrastinate some, and after a few decades the thing is dusty, has a family of raccoons living in the engine compartment, and it’s still not running. That’s how amazing barn finds like this 1970 Dodge Challenger come to be, and thankfully we have a video showing us what it’s like to uncover such an automotive treasure."

Their looks are iconic and so someone might actually like the lack of power, or even better they might be looking to turn such a ride into a powerful restomod using a modern V8."

Yeah, yeah, with the slant-six this thing doesn’t have any muscle, but we’re hoping someone treats it to a V8 soon."

This guy is able to dig up all kinds of amazing finds like this ’70 Challenger and everything isn’t highly staged, overly dramatic, over-the-top nonsense. Yes, he has to contend with a possibly rabid raccoon hiding somewhere and the barn floor has deteriorated, but the guy really focuses on how amazing this barn find car is instead of all the other stuff. Check it out for yourself."
