The story follows a group of human pirates who have been mysteriously transformed into rats. Amidst all of this, the captain’s son, Timothy, has also been kidnapped by the mysterious Flora Burn. You can choose to play as one of four rats (Douglas, Buffalo, Akane, and Bussa) as you hunt Flora Burn and her piratey crew along the way. Each character has full voice acting which is impressive for an indie title. Sure the script is a bit hammy at times, but it makes for a welcome change to relying on drab dialogue boxes."

The combat is pretty one-note as most character’s static attacks involve jabbing the nearest enemies with your sword or staff or whatever weapon they have. There are magic abilities too which are somewhat more exciting, but what with it being rather easy to farm the souls-like levelling up currency, you’ll have your chosen character to be pretty strong, pretty quickly. This has two outcomes; first, it means you’re unlikely to switch characters because getting one character up to full strength is pretty easy. And two, it means that, despite how uninspiring as the static sword-jabbing is, it actually gets the job done pretty well, so there’s not much incentive to use the magic powers."
