<hr>
<p>We've all seen those farms in rural America with rusted cars strewn about the property slowly rotting away, and at some point, we wished we could do something to rescue those <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classics</a>. The YouTube channel <em>Turnin Rust</em> follows a father/son duo as they go on such an adventure across Texas, and the latest episode allows them to stumble upon a treasure trove of abandoned cars while checking out a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1957-chevrolet-bel-air/">1957 Chevrolet Bel Air</a>.</p>

<p>The '57 Chevy was the reason these guys were at this woman's farm, and it looked to be in pretty good condition for a car that hasn't been registered to drive in over 20 years. After spending years under a leaking lean-to with some of the windows broken out, the Bel Air was eventually moved to better protection from an open shed. The car is definitely in rough shape, but the body is pretty solid and wears what appears to be the car's original Colonial Cream paint job.</p>
<p>Once the guys agreed on a price for the Bel Air, the owner suggested they check out some of the other cars that were scattered across her property. This is where they found an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-reworks/">AMC Pacer</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/restomod-1976-international-harvester-scout-ii-offers-plenty-of-perks/">International Scout</a>, some old farm trucks and a handful of vintage Fords, Buicks and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-gets-a-1931-packard-for-free/">Packards </a>all in various stages of rusting away. The cool thing about all these field finds is that while they wear the orange-bodied patina from sitting out in the open for years, the massive amount of chrome has survived much better out in the hot Texas sun.</p>
