Still, it’s a lot of cash to put up for a vehicle, but this one has such historical significance one can understand why it attracted such intense interest. Plus, many agree the 57S is perhaps the most sought-after pre-war car in existence."

Recognizing what he had, the man reached out to all the previous owners as he began a painstaking full restoration. All the mechanical work was done and a good portion of the cosmetic restoration was finished when Turnbull died. However, some pieces still needed to be put back on the car. Even in that state, people clamored for a chance to own it."
