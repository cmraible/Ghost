<p><em>The Washington Post</em> recently put out a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/01/masks-schools-koch-money/">story</a> about a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/independent-women-s-forum-template-letter-opposing-school-mask-mandates/4a991d69-67f2-42b2-8fa7-f9abc0a2fb08/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6">letter</a> campaign against school mask mandates coordinated by the dark money group Independent Women’s Forum. Central to the piece was a detailed account of the conservative group’s close ties to the Koch network and other high-profile donors.</p>
<p>But the piece failed to mention contributions from several corporate donors — including one awkwardly close to home.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>In October, <em>The Washington Post</em> published a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/01/masks-schools-koch-money/">story</a> about how the dark money group Independent Women’s Forum (IWF) had circulated a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/independent-women-s-forum-template-letter-opposing-school-mask-mandates/4a991d69-67f2-42b2-8fa7-f9abc0a2fb08/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6">template letter</a> that parents could use to push back against school mask mandates. While the <em>Post</em>’s piece called out a number of high-profile organizations and “GOP megadonors” bankrolling IWF’s operations, it failed to mention contributions from several major donors — including Amazon, which was founded by the current owner of <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p>The form letter, sent to paying members of the Independent Women’s Network — a project of the IWF and the conservative nonprofit Independent Women’s Voice — offered parents and caregivers a tool to fight against the scientifically proven precautions schools were using to curb the spread of COVID-19, such as mask mandates. According to a medical expert interviewed for the story, the letter “offers an inventory of inaccuracies,” including a claim that “young kids do not significantly spread covid.”</p>
<p>In its coverage, <em>The Washington Post</em> spotlighted IWF’s deep ties to the billionaire Koch brothers and their conservative political and philanthropic networks The story also noted that the dark money group, which raked in nearly $3.8 million in 2019, has received funding from Facebook, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s husband Dick DeVos, and the Walmart family’s philanthropic arm.</p>
<p>Unmentioned: Online retail giant Amazon reported making contributions to IWF in both <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_downloads/2021/political_engagement/2019-Political-Engagement-Statement.pdf">2019</a> and <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_downloads/2021/04/2020-Political-Engagement-Statement.pdf">2020</a>. Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has owned <em>The Washington Post</em> since 2013. The company’s 2019 political contributions <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_downloads/2021/political_engagement/2019-Political-Engagement-Statement.pdf">disclosure</a> noted that all political expenditures were vetted by Amazon’s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, former Obama White House press secretary Jay Carney.</p>

<p>Other noteworthy donors to IWF who went unnamed in <em>The Washington Post</em>’s story include <a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/565eb487f8cf9f96af89a4147ee79eb4cf3989d3c3953197b1e36e65e132b57ffaebccfb03ed62c57b8ffc5cd83654686f6b5160a97d3b561bc65ce5206012e9">Google</a>, the drug lobby <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/530241211/201903169349305220/IRS990ScheduleI">Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America</a>, and the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/131068220/06_2020_prefixes_13-20%2F131068220_201812_990O_2020061117188318">Motion Picture Association of America</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, former <em>Post</em> executive editor Marty Baron <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/washington-post-editor-talks-bezos-amazon-billionaire-owner-reshaped-newspaper/">said</a> Bezos has no control of the paper’s editorial policy. “He said, ‘Cover me the way you cover anybody else, and cover Amazon the way you cover any other company,’” said Baron. “I’ve never experienced anything that calls that into question. He hasn’t interfered in any way whatsoever with our coverage.”</p>

    <li><strong>KELLOGG REPLACES VAST MAJORITY OF STRIKING WORKERS: </strong>Yesterday, cereal giant Kellogg <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-work/kellogg-to-permanently-replace-striking-workers-as-union-rejects-new-contract">announced</a> it is permanently replacing most of its 1,400 workers who went on strike more than two months ago to demand better pay and benefits. The company’s decision stems from most of the workers rejecting a new five-year contract. “This is despite record profits during the pandemic and employees working 80+ hours/week,” <a href="https://twitter.com/QasimRashid/status/1468362504065765379?t=bSukeSIyd4Cpy3DFmle7aA&s=19">tweeted</a> human rights lawyer Qasim Rashid. </li>
    <li><strong>WHITE-COLLAR DEFENSE LAWYERS FIGHT CORPORATE CRACKDOWN:</strong> The Department of Justice’s plans to ramp up enforcement against white-collar criminals recently faced pushback from defense lawyers arguing that the agency is “holding companies to too high of a standard,” according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-officials-dig-in-on-corporate-repeat-offenders-11638405092"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The white-collar defense lawyers’ opposition is linked to Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco’s October <a href="https://bigbusinessblotter.substack.com/p/deputy-ag-monaco-to-doj-prosecutors">announcement</a> that the DOJ’s efforts will include prosecutors scrutinizing repeat offenders. “These are big organizations and try as you might to get it right, there’s gonna be misconduct. That’s what’s troubling us,” said Joseph Warin, chair of the litigation department at the D.C. law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. “One of our clients has three million employees… that’s bigger than every city but eight or nine in the United States.” As Rick Claypool with Public Citizen <a href="https://twitter.com/RickClaypool/status/1466451447634087942?t=jCV8RSHAnNtxRena_TZLPg&s=19">tweeted</a>, the admission that these companies are too big to manage is a sound argument for dismantling them. </li>

    <li><strong>“HOUSED TO HOMELESS IN A MATTER OF DAYS”: </strong>A new <a href="https://nyl.as/t1/49/9816zr2ag2et3av4ckha30x7i/2/b2e013949777e79b41883bf55f7428f9a3e455f21900758c3c773e7b6d064075">interactive brief</a> from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) demonstrates the key role “fast and cheap” evictions play in America’s housing crisis. The brief, which explores how variations in the speed and cost of nonpayment-related evictions in the U.S. impact tenants, highlights how easily people can lose their homes. According to LSC, “In 11 states, tenants can be evicted from their homes in as little as two weeks after missing a rent payment. For low-income renters, this can mean going from housed to homeless in a matter of days.” Once they receive an eviction summons, many tenants face additional challenges, such as finding legal help, taking time off work, and securing childcare to attend their hearings.</li>
    <li><strong>U.K. PAPERS GREENWASH SAUDI ARABIA’S CLIMATE EFFORTS:</strong> A recent <em>Byline Times</em><a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2021/11/29/newspapers-accepted-money-to-publish-positive-environmental-stories-about-saudi-arabia-around-cop26-climate-change-summit/">investigation</a> caught two U.K. newspapers — the <em>Independent</em> and <em>Evening Standard</em> — greenwashing Saudi Arabia’s climate efforts around the time of the COP26 UN climate change summit after accepting an undisclosed sum of money from the country. As <em>Byline Times</em> reported, most of the 50 stories that ran as part of the commercial deal with Saudi Arabia “highlighted positive environmental actions related to the country and failed to mention negative contextual details — such as the fact that Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter and its domestic emissions are nearly three times the G20 average.” Advocacy group Fossil Free London is asking the news outlets for greater transparency about how much they are being paid, so that the public can make more informed decisions about where to receive their news.</li>
