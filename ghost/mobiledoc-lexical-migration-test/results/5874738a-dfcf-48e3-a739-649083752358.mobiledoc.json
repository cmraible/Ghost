Raw and visceral, they were appropriately named since anyone who didn’t exercise caution with one would get bit. They were a worthy successor to the Shelby Cobra’s legacy, a fact which raises the ire of many a Ford enthusiast, but even they would agree treating one like this barn find should be a flogging-worthy offense."

Instead of there maybe being some barn owl droppings on the body and maybe some mice nesting inside, Raccoons likely were propagating on the hood and who knows what else was going on with this Mopar masterpiece. Just thinking about it we get really angry, so let’s just leave it at that."

Then the guy suffered a major heart attack and wasn’t able to work on restoring the car his brother loved so much. You can see the emotion in his body language and hear it in his voice as he talks about the history."

Thankfully, the interior cleaned up even nicer and they installed the missing seats. The end result is pretty amazing, leaving the owner in tears."

The owner says he has a nice spot cleaned out in the barn for it, so maybe we’ll see someone else find it 20 years from now. Actually, he says the plan is to pass it down to his daughter, so here’s to hoping it’s well cared for."
