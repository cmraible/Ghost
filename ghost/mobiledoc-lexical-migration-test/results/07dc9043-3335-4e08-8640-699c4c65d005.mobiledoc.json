Some say GM was the first to try out the concept, while others claim Dodge had a head start; others are still stuck calling the Mustang a muscle car. Even with all of this disagreement, there is one car that many consider being the very first muscle car. That vehicle was called the "

That was, and frankly still is, an insane number for its time as an engine that size wasn't even thought of for a midsize car up until that point. Pontiac itself was always a great brand with its dedication to innovation and ambitious goals of taking over as GM's top-performance brand. Ths car shows that very well with its V8 powertrain and its incredible styling and power steering/brakes, which make driving a ton of fun."

This vehicle comes with an automatic transmission that allows the driver to relax as they drive. Supporting this mission is a tastefully crafted interior, for the time, to give the driver a comfortable but relatively stripped-down interior. This allows the car to do a lot with as little weight as possible, making for a wildly fast car at any drag strip. Overall, this is the perfect vehicle for someone who truly appreciates the history behind the muscle cars we all know and love. So it would be best if you act fast before someone else snatches it up."
