          "A 1973 Holden Torana XUI is not an inexpensive car on the collector car market. Rarely sold to the public, examples that do cross the auction block have no problem pulling well over $100K, and even more when they’re in great condition. So when one goes missing, it’s no small loss. When it was recovered, it’s said that parts of the car were reduced to being held together by tape."

Shawn Hardin (pictured above) was caught with the car, and he has several stories about why he had the car, saying he didn’t steal it himself. Shawn claimed he bought the car for $20k and a swapped Harley Davidson motorcycle. He was then charged and pled guilty to receiving stolen property."
