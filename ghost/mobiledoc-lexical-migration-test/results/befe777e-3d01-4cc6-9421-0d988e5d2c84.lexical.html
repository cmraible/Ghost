<p>While <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">Mopar fans</a> can argue whether the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">Dodge Challenger Hellcat</a> is a better muscle car than the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sheriff-uses-dodge-charger-hellcat/">Dodge Charger Hellcat</a>, there’s no doubt they’ll be pulling for both in the following races against a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-ford-torino-gt-update/">Ford Torino GT</a> and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-wagon-hits-200-mph/">Cadillac CTS-V</a>. And while other always root for the Blue Oval or any GM brand, there are some people who just like watching races or maybe have zero brand loyalty, at least when it comes to the Big Three. Whatever your persuasion, we think you’ll enjoy watching the accompanying video.</p>

<p>The first race you’ll see is a Dodge Charger Hellcat, the four-door people don’t want to call a muscle car, versus a Ford Torino GT. That’s an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1974-camaro-1964-studebaker/">interesting matchup</a> and one we don’t see nearly enough. Unfortunately, we don’t know what kinds of aftermarket mods these two cars are running. The Hellcat is wearing some pretty beefy drag radials in the rear, but that’s the only obvious change from stock spec we can see. But when you see the times for both cars, it immediately becomes obvious neither one is bone stock.</p>
<p>In the middle, you get to see the Ford Torino GT take on the Cadillac CTS-V, which is a matchup we don’t think we’ve ever seen before. It gives you a nice comparison of how a matchup between the Charger Hellcat and the CTS-V would likely go.</p>

<p>Then there’s the race between the Dodge Challenger Hellcat and the Ford Torino GT. Does the absence of rear doors and maybe some extra mods on the pony car help it fare better than the Charger Hellcat? Don’t forget, driver skill is also a factor, which is what makes racing so entertaining.</p>
<p>Yes, all four of these cars are big boys, tipping the scale at a minimum of 4,200 pounds. This means the Dodge twins, which are often criticized for being modern-day porkers, aren’t at some weird disadvantage when it comes to curb weight. But will they be victorious?</p>
<p>Now check out the video: it’s both short and sweet. You don’t have to deal with some ego-maniac YouTuber yammering on about fake drama stuff you don’t care about since it just cuts to the chase.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFndYk0uIy0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
