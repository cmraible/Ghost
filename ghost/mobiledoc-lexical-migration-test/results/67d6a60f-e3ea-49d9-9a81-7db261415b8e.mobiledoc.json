Unfortunately, the Challenger’s late introduction doomed the car to a shortened first generation that ended production halfway through the 1974 model year. In all, only 165,437 examples were sold over four model years, leading to a three-year hiatus for the nameplate. In 1978, the Challenger returned for its second generation as a rebadged Mitsubishi Galant and again in 2008 for its third generation. Today, the Challenger is one of the most popular cars of the segment and was instrumental in kicking off what has been referred to as the second muscle car era. "

Carl Cameron actually based parts of the design for Dodge’s pony car on an older sketch of its muscle car counterpart. Available in two series’, the Challenger and Challenger R/T could both be had as a two-door hardtop, a two-door convertible, or a Special Edition hardtop which added many appearance and comfort features. Representing the Challenger’s high-performance version, the Challenger R/T came standard with a 3-speed manual transmission backed 383-cid V8 producing 335-horsepower."
