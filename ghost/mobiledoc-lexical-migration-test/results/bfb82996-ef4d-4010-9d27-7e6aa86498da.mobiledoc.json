It's my busiest term for teaching, and there are two major submissions to be prepared for: the Interactive MA portfolios, which the students are working on now, and the video projects for the Newspaper and Interactive MA students, which were submitted in the lst week of term. The latter was challenging, because the average quality of final submissions has been the highest I've seen yet, the students were the most worried about their own abilities.
