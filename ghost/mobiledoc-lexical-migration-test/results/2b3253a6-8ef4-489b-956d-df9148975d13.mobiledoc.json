A man walks up and starts off by asking what kind of gas mileage the Chevy gets. Before even waiting for an answer, he launches into a lecture about the global temperatures rising, etc. They just kind of laugh him off but he continues blathering about California doing the “right thing” by pushing for all-electric vehicles, but he seems to have his facts a little convoluted. Basically, this is like your annoying neighbor inviting themselves to your party, then making a big scene trying to prove they’re tougher than you."
