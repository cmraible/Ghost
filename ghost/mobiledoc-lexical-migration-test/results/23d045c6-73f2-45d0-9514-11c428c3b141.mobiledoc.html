<p>When it comes to the classic car market, Japanese cars don't usually come to mind as big sellers. But, the 1967 Toyota 2000GT is an exception. In the past, the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Toyota">Toyota</a> 2000GT has broken records in the past at auction. </p>

<p>When the idea first came about, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Nissan">Nissan</a> passed up the project, and that's when Toyota jumped onboard with Yamaha in a collaborative effort to build Toyota's very first sports car. The 2000GT was a limited production car with just 351 examples built during its 3 year run from 1967 through 1970. To make this car even more rare is the fact that it is left hand drive which makes it just 1 of 62 sold in the United States. This example was owned by an American race car driver named Otto Linten, and he owned it for 30 years.</p>
<p>When the car was first introduced, it was the priciest Japanese car offered at the time with a price tag of ¥2.38 million which equals to be $339,000 in US dollars today. At the time, the 2000GT sold between $6,800 and $7,200, a price that deterred American buyers and made the car slow to sell. </p>

<p>This beauty has been restored and is slathered in its factory hue of Solar Red. It shares qualities with the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/188418/1966-jaguar-e-type-roadster">Jaguar E-Type</a>, and is one of the most beautiful Japanese cars ever created. Powering this classic is a 2.0-liter straight-6 engine shifted via a manual 5-speed transmission. </p>
<p>If looking to get your hands on this restored beauty, it is scheduled on the auction docket through <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0088-1967-toyota-2000gt/820802">RM Sotheby</a> on May 1st - 2nd, 2020 in Elkhart, Indiana. The car is listed without reserve, but it is predicted to go for a high dollar. </p>
<p>A yellow 2000GT was sold for almost $1.2 million in 2013 after crossing the auction stage. An incredible feat considering the car was the most expensive car sold at auction to come from Asia. Another sold example was a white 2000GT built for the Japanese market in 2019, and it fetched for ¥88 million.</p>
