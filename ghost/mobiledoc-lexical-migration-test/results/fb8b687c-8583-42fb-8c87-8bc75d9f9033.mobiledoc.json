Ferrari is the pinnacle of success in the car world, the first car most of us think of when we picture our best life is either a Ferrari or a car inspired by one. This is best embodied through our next entry on the list, a Ferrari 348 GTB. Singhania has an affinity for high horsepower V8s because along with the HotRod and Ferrari he also has several American V8 muscle machines at his disposal including a 1973 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and one Ford Mustang modified for the drag strip. Finally, the boastful billionaire has also been spotted driving a Mercedes-Benz 540K Cabriolet, which can be seen with the top down enjoying the finer things in life."
