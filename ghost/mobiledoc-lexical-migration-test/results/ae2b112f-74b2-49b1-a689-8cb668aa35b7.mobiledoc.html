<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Over the last week, <em>The Daily Poster</em>’s follow-the-money reporting has been breaking open one of the biggest stories of this perilous moment: the story of how Wall Street lobbyists and politicians have made it far harder to target Vladimir Putin and his oligarch network.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/684442641">our new video</a> about the situation — and then <a href="__GHOST_URL__/4-99monthly">click here</a> to use this limited-time discount to become a subscriber for less than $5 to help us do more of this kind of accountability journalism that corporate media continues to avoid.</p>

<p>As a reader-supported news outlet, we don’t answer to Wall Street billionaires — which means we can produce this kind of video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-ukraine-plans-face-wall-street-roadblock/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-administration-may-shield-bank-linked-to-russian-oligarchs/">this</a> that those billionaires want to keep suppressed. We can also show how President Biden has the power to fix the problem — but has so far refused.</p>
<p><strong>But here’s the thing: The only way we can do that kind of accountability journalism is if our free subscribers pitch in and become supporting subscribers.</strong></p>
<p>So please: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/4-99monthly">Click here</a> to use this special discount to become a subscriber. When you do, you get all sorts of exclusive stuff, including live events like the one we did this week with top experts about the Ukraine war. You also get our <em>Citizens Guide To Holding The Powerful Accountable</em>. And you help us keep up the pressure with our reporting and our viral video series.</p>
