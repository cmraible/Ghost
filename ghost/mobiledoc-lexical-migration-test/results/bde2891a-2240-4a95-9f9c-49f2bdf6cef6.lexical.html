<hr>
<p>Lots of people flock to the Go Topless Jeep Weekend at Crystal Beach to show off their rides and enjoy the amazing weather. However, some years things just get out of hand, and that certainly was the case for the 2022 gathering which took place on May 21. An unprecedented number of attendees made policing the crowds difficult, so things got out of hand. Authorities reportedly arrested over 100 people and at least 38 were sent to area hospitals, including 8 airlifted, as huge crowds descended on the Bolivar Peninsula.</p>

<p>Underage drinking, fights, and driving under the influence were all problems attendees and law enforcement cited as all too prevalent in the crowd. Officials say there were about 80,000 at the Jeep Weekend event, which is more than have showed up in years past.</p>

<p>Because of the huge crowds, some waiting in line with their Jeeps for over three hours to board a ferry to transport them between Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Some gave up and went elsewhere, but many eagerly awaited their chance to attend the event.</p>
<p>Sergeant John Hamm was working with Galveston County Sheriff’s Office on the night of May 21 when he was struck by a vehicle traveling about 50 mph. One news station in the area reported the crash, which happened at 1:30 am, was so violent it almost sent Hamm through the windshield.</p>
<p>According to a post from his mother, Hamm was on the scene of a minor accident when he was hit, the collision breaking both of his legs. He also suffered lacerations to his face, head, and left arm. It wasn’t clear if the person who hit Sgt. Hamm was in the area because of the Go Topless Jeep Weekend event.</p>
<p>As for the driver, a 22-year-old man from China, Texas, he was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer. His bond was set at $100,000.</p>
