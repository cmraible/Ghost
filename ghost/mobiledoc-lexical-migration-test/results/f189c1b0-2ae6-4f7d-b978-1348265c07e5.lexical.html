<hr>
<p>Legendary actor Burt Reynolds drove a vintage black-and-gold Pontiac Firebird Trans Am straight to our hearts and right into Hollywood history in Smokey and the Bandit. Unfortunately, this Hollywood hero passed away in September 2018 at the age of 82, but his memory lives on with us forever. Now, you have the opportunity to win a 'Bandit' of your own, a 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Special Edition signed by Burt himself. Enter the Bandit Dream Giveaway and increase your chances to win by using <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/bandit?promo=MOTORIOUS3">promo code MOTORIOUS3</a> with any donation of $25 or more. Even better, veterans' and children's charities benefit from the donations you make. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/bandit?promo=MOTORIOUS3">'79 Pontiac</a> has been fully restored and features all things one would expect out of a Bandit Trans Am with the Special Edition Y84 package. Under the hood sits a numbers-matching 403-cubic-inch V-8 engine backed by an automatic transmission that shifts power down through a 2.41 rear axle. The doors open up to a black vinyl standard interior complete with an AM/FM radio and air conditioning. Also, the car is equipped with both power brakes and power steering for easy drivability.</p>
<p>Even better, this retro Firebird TA has only 37,000 original miles on the ticker. The show-stopping paint was courtesy of Classic Pontiac Rescue, the restoration parts were provided by Ames Performance Engineering and the reproduction Goodyear tires on the factory-issued Snowflake wheels were provided by Kelsey Tire.</p>
<p>“I know what an important part the <em>Smokey and the Bandit</em> movie has played in the lives of so many of my fans.”— Burt Reynolds (2015)</p>
