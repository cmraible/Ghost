Little did people know the glory years would come apart like a Ford Pinto soaking in salt water for 10 minutes just a few years later. To help relive that time of innocent fun, we bring to you a drag race between a 1970 Chevelle SS 454 and a 1970 Buick GS 455 Stage 1, two titans in the muscle car segment and both from GM. Some might feel torn about which one to side with for this faceoff, but others might think this one is a no-brainer.",
