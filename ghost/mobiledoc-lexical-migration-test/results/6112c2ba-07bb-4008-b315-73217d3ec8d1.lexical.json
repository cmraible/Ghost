So they brought this 1971 GTO convertible in and began restoration. The Vision for the car was “Something I could go on a date in”, it was built to be a driver's car and it delivers on that. Sporting an LS8 mated to a 485LE automatic transmission being controlled by GM computers, this car makes considerable strides when it comes to performance. The gas tank had to be modified because of the custom long-travel chassis made by Schwartz, this allows the close to 50-year-old car to drive like brand-new.",

Just the wheels alone make up a significant portion of that cost, being HRE’s their cost is somewhere in the $10-15K range.
