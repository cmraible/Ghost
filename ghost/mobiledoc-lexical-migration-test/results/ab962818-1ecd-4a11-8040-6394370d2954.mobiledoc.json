However, this Bronco someone made out of snow is, well, ice cold. A talented snow sculpture artist named Eric Jones posted a photo of his handiwork to Facebook and it is definitely impressive."

The hardtop supplier for the off-roader has reportedly had trouble keeping up with demand, thanks in part to the pandemic, because everything gets blamed on that these days. There’s a rumor that the hardtop supply issue has been fixed, so we’ll see if that means a tidal wave of new Broncos will be hitting roads and hopefully trails near you soon."
