Carbon fiber abounds on the car, there’s custom billet aluminum pieces, and other professional-grade treatments. Bertelsen designed some of the parts using CAD, so he’s not some average guy just tinkering. To get more in-depth detail on the build, watch the video accompanying this article. It provides plenty of insight and you get to see Green Mamba in action."
