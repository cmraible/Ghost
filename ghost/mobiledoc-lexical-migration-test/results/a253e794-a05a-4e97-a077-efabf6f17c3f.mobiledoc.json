The majority of enthusiasts believed that a total of 6 GT350 convertibles were produced for the 1966 model year, but that number was proven incorrect after documentation was discovered in Carroll Shelby's Gardena office. In paperwork that was dated June 7, 1966, a statement read “Four experimental convertibles are being run through the shop at present time … One of these units is sold and the other three will be used for test purposes in anticipation of a 1967½ GT350 convertible.” Clearly, only 4 actual '66 Shelby GT350 convertibles were ever built, and this stunning example is the very first.

Two of the cars featured automatic transmissions, and the other two were shifted via a 4-speed manual. In fact, these four cars would be the only four Shelby cars in the first two production years that were fitted with factory air conditioning. Last but not least, only one of those cars retains the original engine, and that would be this Ivy Green example being offered here through Mecum with Serial No. 6S2375. "

This car made its way to Hayward Ford in Hayward, CA, on February 14th, 1967 where it was utilized as a pace car at SCCA Bay Area until the car was bought by Derek Scott of Walnut Creek complete with \"Shelby Pace Car\" lettering on the doors. Under Scott's ownership, the car was media-blasted and repainted in white before being resprayed again in blue. At this time, the interior was also changed from its original black to blue along with other modifications. "

Later on, Clifford Hornback of Vinita, Oklahoma, discovered this car in the mid-'70s in rough shape. Knowing the value and rarity of this Shelby, an extremely careful and meticulous restoration was started on the car with the help of Jim Wicks, a noted Shelby enthusiast. Thankfully, the original Shelby parts were saved from the car including engine and suspension components. Just two changes were made to the car from its stock setup being the over-the-top \"Le Mans\" stripes in Hertz Gold to match the rocker stripes and the addition of a Paxton supercharger."
