<p>When it comes to off-roading no name is more synonymous with the topic than that of the Land Rover automotive manufacturer. Over the years, <a href="https://www.ospreycustomcars.com/vehicles/1975-land-rover-forward-control">Land Rover</a> has built some of the sickest vehicles to ever hit the mud trails and has even made a name for some of the older vehicles. For instance, this rugged <a href="https://www.ospreycustomcars.com/vehicles/1975-land-rover-forward-control">1975 Land Rover</a> forward control truck. Now you might be thinking that 1975 was a long time ago, and youâ€™d be right. However, this truck is not all original it may even be able to keep up with some of the best off-road type vehicles of today.</p>

<p>The owner built this <a href="https://www.ospreycustomcars.com/vehicles/1975-land-rover-forward-control">unique Land Rover</a> to be the first word in beach cruising and off-road adventure, that's why they stripped the whole car down and gave it some new goodies to play with. One such goodie is a 6.2L LS V8 mated to an all-new 6-speed automatic transmission. Power is being funneled through the updated LT-230 transfer case giving this vehicle the 4X4 capabilities of a modern truck. Another Easter egg that hits at a contemporary take on this old relic, equipped with rough H1 Hummer beadlock wheels, the truck is as sturdy and stable as they come.</p>

<p>While the original styling may reflect the past but that doesn't mean that the paint has to. The body has been finished in Keswick Green, this allows <a href="https://www.ospreycustomcars.com/vehicles/1975-land-rover-forward-control">the truck</a> to retain the 'Military-style' aesthetic. All of the original Galvy trim has been refurbished and a custom soft-top cage has been built to fit the convertible top and ensure maximum pleasure driving on the beach. The presence of a clean title helps this truck to achieve perfection, this green mean machine looks like it just mud-crawled off of the set of Jurassic Park, and now it's for sale with all of the goods to make it the ultimate <a href="https://www.ospreycustomcars.com/vehicles/1975-land-rover-forward-control">off-roading touring vehicle</a>.</p>
