Just watching the way that the light seems to bend around the wrap-around bumper sends chills down the spine of any on-lookers lucky enough to find themselves in the presence of this wild child. The car originally came in that Sassy Green mentioned previously, however, the panther pink seemed a better match for this particular speed demon. At that point, the car was only missing one thing, that classic 60s muscle car prerequisite, a vinyl top of course.
