<p><a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194870/1984-chevrolet-k-20-scottsdale">This 1984 Chevrolet K20 Scottsdale</a> is a really clean and solid truck from Oregon. This is a pretty original Survivor truck that was repainted quite a few years ago and also has had some interior work done. The body on this truck is in great condition with no evidence of rust or rust repair. When it was repainted it was done in its original colors of Desert Sand and Doeskin. The paint still shows great with only minor imperfections from use and driving. The underside is also very clean and original.</p>
<h3 id="1976-datsun-280z">1976 Datsun 280Z</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1976-datsun-280z.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>

<h3 id="1986-chevrolet-corvette-pace-car">1986 Chevrolet Corvette Pace Car</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1986-chevrolet-corvette-pace-car.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>When you walk around <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194396/1986-chevrolet-corvette-pace-car">this C4</a> you will notice that the body is in phenomenal condition with excellent fit of all the panels. It's covered in the Black that has a stunning finish and is slick as a ribbon. It's accented by the Gold Pace Car Decals and The Tan Convertible Top. All of the glass in this '86 looks amazing and the side windows have a great fit with the top up. You can also see that all the weather stripping is in great condition.

<h3 id="2002-trans-am">2002 Trans Am</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/2002-pontiac-firebird-trans-am.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>We didn't know it back then, but this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194862/2002-pontiac-firebird-trans-am">2002 Pontiac Trans Am</a> was the last time we'd ever get a T/A from Pontiac. So it's great to have such a highly original example. And this final-year car has everything you want, including a fuel-injected V8, T-tops, and an affordable price. The Pewter Metallic paint appears to be the original factory application. That's what we like to see on the last of the Trans Ams, especially because it retains a nice luster in the sunshine.</p>
<h3 id="1996-mazda-miata-mx-5">1996 Mazda Miata MX-5</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1996-mazda-miata-mx-5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Lightweight and minimal mechanical complexity is the basis for the MX-5 that debuted in 1989. However, the Miata is just a future evolution of small sports roadsters from the 1960's such as the Tiumph Spitfire and the Datsun 2000. The first generation that lasted through 1997 sold over 400,000 units and is most recognizable by its pop-up headlights. Although light and not that complex, it is still a modern car in the fact that they were equipped with all the modern safety features that were required. Receiving many accolades over the years including Car and Drivers annual “Ten Best” award 14 times and Grassroots Motorsports magazine named <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194754/1996-mazda-miata-mx-5">the Miata</a> as the most important sports car built during the previous 25 years.</p>

As far as we can tell, this truck spent its entire life in California and it shows.</p>
