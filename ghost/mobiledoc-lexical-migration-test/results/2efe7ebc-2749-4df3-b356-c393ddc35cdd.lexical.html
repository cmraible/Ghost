<hr>
<p>Ronald McDonald House Central Valley is giving away this incredible car, and when you <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">use the code WIN</a> at checkout, you get more entries to <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">WIN it</a>. It features the 3LT equipment group, an Arctic White finish, and Carbon Flash accents. Redesigning the Corvette for its eighth-generation, Chevrolet moved the 6.2L V8 engine to the middle of the car, just behind the seats. This gave the Corvette supercar powers by redistributing its weight resulting in a ratio of 40-percent front and 60-percent rear. </p>

<p>With 495-horsepower, an 8-speed transmission, and increased aerodynamics the <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">C8 is the most powerful</a> base model Corvette ever but this example isn’t your average base model ‘Vette. An electronic limited-slip differential, performance ratio rear axle, performance Brembo anti-lock brakes, and performance suspension​ package are all included with the Z51 Performance Package. Chevrolet has delivered a faster and <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">stronger Corvette</a> that can accelerate, corner, and brake harder than ever before.</p>

<p>In addition to the new design's performance accomplishments, <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2021-corvette-convertible">the Corvette has</a> also never looked so good. The contrast created by the Carbon Flash painted nacelles, Carbon Flash painted 5-open-spoke aluminum wheels, and Carbon Flash painted side vents is just the beginning as the sharper more defined body lines really bring the look together. That new found supercar style is continued to the cockpit where nearly everything is covered in black leather including the GT2 bucket seats. Thanks to the retractable hardtop, the roof can be raised or lowered at speeds up to 30-mph.</p>
