When cars cost too much for the majority of the public to consider them for daily transportation, plus clogged roads favor those on two wheels, motorcycles reign supreme. As a result, Thai motorcycle racing is an unbelievable experience, as you’re about to see in the video accompanying this article. It’s also something few foreigners have ever beheld.",
