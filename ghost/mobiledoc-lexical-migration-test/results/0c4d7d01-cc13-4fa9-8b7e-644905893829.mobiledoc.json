To get a peek into what made Combs tick, why she put it all on the line, that’s the real draw here. She was definitely a unique woman and it may be a long time before another like her comes along."

          "“I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m not ready to die,” Combs says in the trailer. That’s enough to put a shiver down your spine since we all know the twist ending. She knew the level of risk in what she was doing – how couldn’t she? Yet instead of shrinking back, she leaned into it, acknowledging the risk openly. There’s wisdom in that, there’s something everyone can learn from her attitude."

It was obviously a deeply personal decision and one we’re not advocating, but for anyone who thinks her career was all just glory and the admiration of the masses, she suffered just like the rest of us do, even if her suffering was unique in some ways."
