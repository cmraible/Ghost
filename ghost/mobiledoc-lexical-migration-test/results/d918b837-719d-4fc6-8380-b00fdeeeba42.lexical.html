<p>A few weeks back, the BBC published a report about <a href="http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a>‘s latest findings about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7417496.stm">how web users operate</a>. As Kristine pointed out, it had a<a href="http://kristinelowe.blogs.com/kristine_lowe/2008/05/when-exactly-did-reading-news-become-an-altruistic-gesture.html"> dumb, dumb headline</a>, but there were several real gems of information in there.</p>

<div>Here’s one every web editor and magazine publisher should study and think about:</div>
<div> </div>> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">In 2004, about 40% of people visited a homepage and then drilled down to where they wanted to go and 60% use a deep link that took them directly to a page or destination inside a site. In 2008, said Dr Nielsen, only 25% of people travel via a homepage. The rest search and get straight there.</span>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;">All that time you’re lavishing on your web site’s front page? Only a quarter of your visitors are using it. And that number is shrinking every day.</span></span></p>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;">Every single page in your site is your home page. Start designing (and writing) for that fact.</span></span></div><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
