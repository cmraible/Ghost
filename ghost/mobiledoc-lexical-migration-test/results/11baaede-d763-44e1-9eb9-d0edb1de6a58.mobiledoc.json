A new, and particularly interesting, episode aired on February 4th, 2021 featuring a Chicago resident, Jon Benett and his 2018 3.6L V6 Challenger GT. AmericanMuscle host Adam Maqboul connected with the Chicago elementary school principal to find out the inspiration behind this ultimate daily driver."
