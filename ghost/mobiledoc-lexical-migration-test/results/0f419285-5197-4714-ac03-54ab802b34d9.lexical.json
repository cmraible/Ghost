Just keep in mind in Australia a Mustang is foreign and fairly rare, plus vehicles cost significantly more there. Also, the Aussie auto market has been flooded not only by cheap Korean brands like Kia and Hyundai, but even cheaper Chinese brands. We actually really feel for them because of all that, especially since there used to be some really cool cars made Down Under.",
