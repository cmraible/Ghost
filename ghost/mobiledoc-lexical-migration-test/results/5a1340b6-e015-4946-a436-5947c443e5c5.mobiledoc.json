It’s a 2019 Dodge Charger Pursuit with a Dodge Demon engine swap, plus a widebody carbon-fiber body. What’s more, the supercharger has been ditched in favor of twin turbos with output reaching a devilish 1,525-horsepower. To help control all that power, the sedan is outfitted with all-wheel drive. Hopefully this doesn’t have a tragic ending."
