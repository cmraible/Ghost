Before late-night video game sessions, movies and bars were options, these shows were <em>the haps</em> for millennials on Friday nights. I mean, who wasn&#8217;t stuck at their grandparents at some point while their parents went out on a date, with nothing but Ace of Base<em> </em>on cassette and the comedic stylings of Jaleel White to hold them over?</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t have been the only one.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve taken a look back at these shows, but in doing so, I stumbled across some technology that was great back then but has since been replaced by something exponentially better. Still, it&#8217;s fun to peer into the past &#8212; even if it makes me feel extremely old. I mean, has it really been 24 years since TGIF first went on the air? Really? Ugh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mr-feenie-walkman.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28877\" alt=\"mr-feenie-walkman\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mr-feenie-walkman-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/mr-feenie-walkman-300x225.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/mr-feenie-walkman.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>1. The Walkman, <em>Boy Meets World</em></h2>\n<p>Yep, this is Mr. Feeny, clutching Sony&#8217;s famous cassette-based music player <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Kk8Sg8TljFw?t=3m8s\">in front of its owner</a>, one Cory Matthews. The original Walkman came to the U.S. in 1980, about 13 years before the first episode of <em>Boy Meets World</em> hit the airwaves. This gadget had some staying power, but the CD version wasn&#8217;t far from supplanting it, and MP3 players would become popular less than a decade later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/urkel-trans-chamber.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28878\" alt=\"urkel-trans-chamber\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/urkel-trans-chamber-300x165.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/urkel-trans-chamber-300x165.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/urkel-trans-chamber.png 634w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>2. Transformation Chamber, <em>Family Matters</em></h2>\n<p>What, you didn&#8217;t have one of these growing up? Yeah, we didn&#8217;t either. This transformation chamber, invented by <em>Family Matters&#8217;</em> Steve Urkel, transformed him from the nerdiest of nerds into the suave and dapper Stefan Urquelle. Time would prove, however, that a revamped exterior and a lot of smooth talk could not adequately replace the original. Take notes, Windows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/codys-camcorder-step-by-step.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28879\" alt=\"cody's camcorder-step-by-step\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/codys-camcorder-step-by-step-300x163.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/codys-camcorder-step-by-step-300x163.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/codys-camcorder-step-by-step.png 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>3. Cody&#8217;s camcorder,<em> Step By Step</em></h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve searched high and low trying to determine exactly what make and model this is, and I&#8217;m leaning toward Canon&#8217;s ES800, which debuted in October 1994. The ES800 used 8mm tapes, a technology that has since been replaced by high-capacity memory cards. A quick search on eBay shows an ES800 listed for $15 with zero bids, so if you want to relive this somewhat-forgettable moment in <em>Step By Step</em> history (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0709936/\">a Foster/Lambert Production</a>), you can do so on the cheap.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dinosaurs-phone.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28880\" alt=\"dinosaurs-phone\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dinosaurs-phone-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/dinosaurs-phone-300x225.jpg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/dinosaurs-phone.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>4. Rotary telephone, <em>Dinosaurs</em></h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s said that dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago. That&#8217;s clearly not true, because the rotary telephone didn&#8217;t make its way into U.S. homes until 1919, and as you can see above, the stars of ABC&#8217;s <em>Dinosaurs</em> had such a device, along with access to flannel shirts, high chairs, and many other conveniences we don&#8217;t associate with these supposed &#8220;extinct&#8221; creatures. Someone, somewhere, is a liar. Just for fun, here&#8217;s a link to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNR4hKbSH7I\">the one thing you probably remember about this show</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/full-house-snes.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28884\" alt=\"full-house-snes\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/full-house-snes-300x168.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/full-house-snes-300x168.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/full-house-snes.png 599w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>5. Super Nintendo Entertainment System, <em>Full House</em></h2>\n<p>Nintendo&#8217;s Super follow-up to the extremely popular NES arrived in 1991. Three years later, we got to watch four adults become addicted to a child&#8217;s video game on <em>Full House</em>. As Danny, Becky, Jesse and Joey take over the monstrously-sized gamepad and obsess over the action, little Michelle does a terrible, terrible thing &#8212; she pulls the cartridge out while the system is on. Have mercy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/salem-computer.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28886\" alt=\"salem-computer\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/salem-computer-300x222.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/salem-computer-300x222.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2013/08/salem-computer.png 778w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>6. Salem&#8217;s computer, <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em></h2>\n<p>It appears that a crew member tried, and failed, to scribble out the logo on the back of this device. A close look and you can probably determine that Salem&#8217;s tiny computer from <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em> is from the Compaq family. But which device, exactly? After some digging, I&#8217;m pretty confident that we&#8217;re looking at the <a href=\"http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;id=1411&amp;c=compaq_pc_companion_c2010c__pc_companion_c2015c\">Compaq PC Companion C2010c</a>, which first landed on countertops in September 1998. The C2010c packed a lightning-fast 75 MHz processor and a hefty 20 MB of RAM into a small, Microsoft Handheld PC 2.0-powered device that, in terms of form factor, was actually a little ahead of its time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvvQ5eXcC5g\">And now I want a talking cat all over again</a>.</p>\n"
