However, the interior had the shipping wrap on the driver’s seat, the tag on the sun visor, and they say it still smelled like new."

The current owner spoke to the original owner, Dave, who brought the car home from the dealer. A dent in the fender and mismatched paint after the dealer replaced the fender led to Dave beginning a disassembly process of the exterior trim in preparation for a complete repaint. However, fate stepped in and Dave was laid off. By the time the man’s financial fortunes improved, he no longer had the interest in working on the sports car, turning his attention instead to his new passion, pickups."
