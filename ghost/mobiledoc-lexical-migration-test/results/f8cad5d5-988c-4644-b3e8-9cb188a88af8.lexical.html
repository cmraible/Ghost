<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It’s been an eventful week, and <em>The Lever</em>’s podcasts are here to bring you up to speed. On <em>Lever Time</em>, I spoke with a plasma physicist about the recent breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, announced on Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Energy. It’s a BIG deal for the future of clean energy — and we look at all the reasons why.</p>
<p>Speaking of big deals: This week, <em>The Audit </em>officially returns for its second mini-season. This time around, hosts Dave, Josh, and their new study buddy Nina Turner are auditing David Axelrod and Karl Rove’s MasterClass on campaign strategy and messaging. If you haven’t had a chance to check out <em>The Audit</em>, now is the time to do so. It’s basically like listening to a great high school book report, except the book’s authors are deranged hacks who are poisoning American politics and culture.</p>

<p>In the new episode of <em>Lever Time</em>: In light of the recent breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, David Sirota sits down with UK plasma physicist Dr. Arthur Turrell to learn about this “holy grail” of scientific research. Could nuclear fusion be deployed to combat the climate crisis, and how long would it take to do so?</p>

<p>In the new episode of <em>The Audit</em>, Dave, Josh and their new study buddy, Senator Nina Turner, crack open the books once again and begin another audit. This time around they’ll be sitting through the entirety of David Axelrod and Karl Rove’s MasterClass on campaign strategy and messaging. Yes, we’re just as upset as you are.</p>

<p>This week, the study group completed the first three lessons of this terrible MasterClass, which introduces students to the fundamentals of running a political campaign, starting with assessing your candidate. They also explore Rove and Axelrod’s biographies, and how one of them became the chief campaign strategist for one of our worst modern presidents and the other the head strategist for one of our slightly less worse — but not great — modern presidents.</p>
