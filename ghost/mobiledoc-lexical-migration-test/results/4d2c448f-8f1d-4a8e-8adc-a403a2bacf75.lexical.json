Either way, it's about a third of the cost of high-priced European supercars that are still slow even though their claim to fame has largely been performance over the years. Instead of keeping with the expectation set by Dodge, dealerships have gone out of their way to squeeze as much money as they possibly can out of enthusiasts, especially with this model such as in the case of Khaled Alsalman from Kahl SRT. When all was said and done, his car was given a $100,000 Market adjustment fee or dealer markup in layman's terms. So make no mistake, dealerships aren't setting aside their greed just because of dodges vision of affordable enthusiast-based performance cars.",
