<p>So, Twitter has made another major change to the platform - experimentally, at least. A limited number of people can now determine who can reply to their Tweets. A thousand female journalists sign in relief, as the idea of stifling <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys/?europe=true">the reply guys</a> appeals.</p>

<p>But…</p>
<p>Well, inevitably, I have reservations. Firstly, it can make debunking much harder. You may no longer be able to reply to misinformation with a correction - and thus your correction is much less likely to be seen. And, it rather reinforces the end of the early Twitter, where everyone being able to talk to anyone else was seen as a good thing. </p>
<p>Twitter is now far from a level playing field, and if this continues, it will increasingly be a place where the <em>hoi polloi</em> get to watch the great and the good have conversations amongst themselves. It's still probably the right move - but I feel justified in mourning the positive aspects of what was there before being lost - even as we celebrate the stifling of the more negative elements. </p>
<p>And, as <a href="https://www.martinbryant.net/big-revolution-newsletter/">Martin</a> managed to extract from Twitter product, this is just the first step: </p>

<p>This will be interesting to watch, because the law of unintended consequences is bound to kick in. </p>

<h2 id="let-the-experts-speak">Let the experts speak</h2>
<p>Crossing the political aisle, I've been pleasently surprised by <em>The Spectator</em> through this crisis. Editor Fraser Nelson seems good at letting something of a diversity of voices into his pages. He had <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/what-is-the-real-impact-of-lockdown-on-the-nhs-">the editor of </a><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/what-is-the-real-impact-of-lockdown-on-the-nhs-"><em>HSJ</em></a><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/what-is-the-real-impact-of-lockdown-on-the-nhs-"> on the podcast</a> - trade press are rarely taken that seriously by more mainstream media, and Nelson gave him the freedom to tell his side of it, even when it clashed with the <em>Speccie</em>'s own narrative. </p>
<p>And this, by <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/rupert-beale">a scientist working at the Crick Institute</a>, does a good job of unpicking the complexities around immunity and vaccines with coronaviruses.</p>
<p>It's a good case for letting unfiltered expert voices through. </p>
