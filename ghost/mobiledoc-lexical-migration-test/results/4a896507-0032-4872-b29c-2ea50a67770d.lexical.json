One of the places hard hit by criminals using Dodge Challengers and Chargers to street race, steal other rides, do street takeovers, and even kill innocent people is the Detroit area. This fact has been highlighted recently in a Deadline Detroit article by Nancy Derringer.",

And since the car is likely stolen, it will be later ditched, often with most if not all the components stripped off, but probably after it’s used to commit a few more crimes.",
