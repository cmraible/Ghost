<p>On October 30th, at the 2018 at the SEMA show in Las Vegas, Superformance LLC introduced the latest in their line of exciting <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJwYWdlIjoyLCJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbInBlcmZvcm1hbmNlIl19">1960's inspired Continuation</a> and Replica Models. This time, mating the GT40's LeMans victories from 1968 and 1969 with the Ford GT's recent LeMans Victory. The Future GT Forty is based upon the GT40MKI Body and Chassis that Superformance has been building since the early 2000's. Introducing Aero based upon the modern Ford Gt Race cars such as Twin Carbon Fiber Canards, Quick Detach Carbon Rear Wing, and removable Carbon Fiber front splitter. The paint Scheme was a no-brainer as it sports the same paint scheme as the #68 Ford GT that recently won LeMans for Ford.</p>

While I don't exactly agree with the sentiment that the C6 was the best Corvette, the argument for them is pretty solid. This Jetstream Blue Metallic ZR1 3ZR package equipped Vette is 1 of only 295 produced for this year.</p>
