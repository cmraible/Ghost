The black power convertible top has been replaced along with the black Boot for when the top is down. Every piece of chrome and stainless on this car shines like it should. Front and rear spoilers and a set of 15” SS Wheels with Firestone Wide Oval Tires finish off the cars look."

However the addition of custom armrests and cup holders is a nice touch that adds a bit of modern comfort. The dash is in very good condition and features a working tachometer. Likewise, the console gauges are also in good working condition."

The attention to detail spent making the engine bay appear completely factory is extraordinary right down to the use of GM hoses and factory style exhaust manifolds. Transferring power to the 12 bolt posi rear end with 3.55 gears is a Turbo 350 transmission perfectly cradled beneath a rock solid undercarriage. "
