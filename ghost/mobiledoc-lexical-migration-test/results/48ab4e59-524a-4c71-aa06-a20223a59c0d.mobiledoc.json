Microsoft is aware of this fact, and is looking for a way to convince you to buy one…but mainly if you’re already a Mac user looking to make the switch to Windows.</p>\n<p>Until July 31, <a href=\"http://content.microsoftstore.com/en-us/offers/westfieldcenturycity#offer-surface-pro-3-trade-in\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft is offering up to $650 in store credit towards the purchase of a Surface Pro 3 when you trade in your old Macbook Air</a>. Specifically, your Macbook “must power on to be considered working” and “water-damaged devices and devices with cracked screens are not considered working devices.” So if your Macbook Air became a Macbook Water after a flood or something, your computer’s no good here.</p>\n<p>This is just the latest such offer from Microsoft targeting its old rival. In September of last year, Microsoft ran two trade-in offers: one wanted <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2013/09/13/microsoft-launches-ipad-trade-promotion/\" target=\"_blank\">old iPads in exchange for a Surface RT</a>, and one was for <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2013/09/27/microsoft-offering-200-for-your-old-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">old iPhones for – duh – a shiny new Windows Phone</a>. The difference this time around is that the Surface Pro 3 is actually something you may want to seriously consider as a viable option.</p>\n<p>If you need convincing, Microsoft has a whole stat sheet detailing why the Surface Pro 3 is superior to the Macbook, but at the end of the day, you probably won’t be swayed unless you’re looking for a change. And on that note, I do have to wonder if there are any Mac users out there who actually want to go to Windows 8 from OS X. I know what <em>I</em> prefer, and that’s why I’m still using Windows despite my qualms with it.</p>\n<p>So are any of you out there considering this offer? The Surface Pro 3 is a really great machine, and I have a feeling that if you get one, you’ll probably be happy for quite a while. But are you willing to make the switch from Apple to Microsoft? What are your feelings on the dueling operating systems?</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://content.microsoftstore.com/en-us/offers/westfieldcenturycity#offer-surface-pro-3-trade-in\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Store</a>]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
