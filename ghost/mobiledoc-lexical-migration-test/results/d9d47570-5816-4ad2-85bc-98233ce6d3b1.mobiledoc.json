That’s why now might be the best time to pull the trigger and get that dream car. With that in mind, we present for your consideration a 1993 Nissan Skyline GT-R V-Spec from the Motorious inventory."

With a mere 9,918 miles on the clock (or 15,963 km, actually) this thing has barely been broken in, so you can love and cherish it and not have to deal with all kinds of problems from the previous owner thrashing it for tens of thousands of abusive miles. That right there is a huge plus, but there’s more to this car."

Just like the regular R32 GT-Rs, the Spec-V features all-wheel drive, but there’s an active limited-slip differential as well as four-piston Brembo brakes, pushing performance further. It also gained unique 17-inch wheels. Nissan built just over 1,400 V-Spec cars for 1993, so they’re highly sought after by enthusiasts and collectors."

This R32 is already imported and ready to go, sitting in California at the moment."
