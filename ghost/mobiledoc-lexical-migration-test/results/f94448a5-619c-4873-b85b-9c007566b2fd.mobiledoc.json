The horrific event, which unfolded just before midnight on May 18 in Detroit, perfectly illustrates the vehicle theft crime wave isn’t just merely an inconvenience but a serious threat to public safety."

While the white tank tops aren’t distinctive and neither are the dark blue Adidas pants, not everyone is walking around with some Dior Homme designer shoes. We’re not fashion experts, but those who know more about that sort of thing claim the shoes are B22s, meaning they retail for a cool $1,300. The person who had them, whether they bought or stole them, probably posted about them on social media and bragged about their sweet kicks in person."
