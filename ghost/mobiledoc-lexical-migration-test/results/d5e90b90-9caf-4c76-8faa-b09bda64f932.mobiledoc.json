Those have been showing that lately, the Dodge Challenger is king, with the "

Back in Q2 of 2021 the Blue Oval’s pony car was much closer to the Mopar lead, so the distance between the two seems to be increasing. Ford executives likely feel a sense of relief that the Challenger is going away, although what it will be replaced by remains to be seen."

A mere 4,545 units were sold last quarter, making it a distant third in the market. Thanks to the factory shutdown last year, that was still good enough for a 62.79% increase in sales. Like the Challenger, the Camaro is supposed to also be moving on to that garage in the sky."
