<p>In the physical version of the Xenoblade Chronicles 2’s soundtrack, there was a discussion between Tetsuya Takahashi and Koh Kojima. In that discussion, they discussed future ambitions for titles that they want to make for the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Among these were Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Xenoblade Chronicles X2 and an entirely new project. Monolith Soft had recently released new artwork that was nothing like we have ever seen from them, and they were recently hiring for developers to work on their “new ambitious project”.</p>
<p>Monolith Soft have also expressed interest about porting the Wii U’s Xenoblade Chronicles X to the Switch?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you make of all this? Are you ready for more of Monolith’s games on the Switch? Let us know in the comment section below.</p>
