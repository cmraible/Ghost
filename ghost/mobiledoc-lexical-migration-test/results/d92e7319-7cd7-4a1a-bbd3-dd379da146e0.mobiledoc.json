The Texas shop claims it will provide the level of feedback and accuracy one would expect from a racecar. To achieve that, Hennessey chose rack and pinion steering with electric power assistance. Up front and in the rear is a double wishbone suspension with fully adjustable coilover Penske dampers. As for the brakes, there will be 6-piston calipers up front and 4-piston calipers in the rear, plus carbon-ceramic pads used all around."
