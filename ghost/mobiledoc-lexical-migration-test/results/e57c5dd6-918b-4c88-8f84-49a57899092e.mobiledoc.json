This happens a lot in movies for a variety of reasons, like maybe the production crew couldn’t secure the exact car wanted for a certain look. In this case, they turned to Intermeccanica, a well-known builder of Speedster replicas based out of Canada. The result is enough to fool most people into believing the classic sports car is genuine, all without any Hollywood magic."

Lent to the production crew by Nick Psyllos, a San Diego resident, it was actually driven by Connelly for filming instead of a stunt double. For Psyllos this was a wise move since he’s added to the car’s value by allowing it to star in a blockbuster which undoubtedly will be loved by so many."

          "Made from 1967 to 1973, the 911 S or the sports version of Porsche’s grand tourer established several firsts for the 911 lineup. It was the first engine derivative, boasting a meaty 160-horsepower when it first emerged with the 2.0-liter flat-six for ’67 and ‘68, with output being bumped to 190-hp, thanks to the 2.4-liter engine. Combined with tighter handling and a lower curb weight, it was the 911 of choice for those who wanted to drive hard. Many will note it wore Fuchs wheels before any other, with the five-spoke design quickly becoming a favorite of many enthusiasts, an affinity that is alive and well in the fanbase today. The movie car proudly wears its Fuchs."
