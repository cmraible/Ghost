          "We all had childhood heroes growing up, whether they were all-powerful like superman or someone we know and hold dear like a father. Either way, looking up to our idols drove many of us to become car enthusiasts and choose the path for our lives. Recently, a sixth-grade boy, Jacob Lensch, expressed his love for cars and the great man he looks up to in the automotive industry. We all likely share a similar sentiment because that man's name was Carroll Shelby. So how did one minor assignment from a young car guy plant a seed for something so much bigger?"

          "Essentially, Jacob's class was given a paper in which they were asked if they would like to visit any past events or periods that they might not have had the chance to see. Accompanying a thoughtful drawing of a Shelby racing vehicle was a paragraph explaining how Jacob would have loved to see Carroll's prized GT40 beat Ferrari to a pulp in the 24 hours de Le Mans. Naturally, this sparked an idea in his teacher's mind, who was an avid Shelby fan, racing his own Shelby Mustang on the weekends, and he quickly posted the paper to a Shelby enthusiast group."
