<p>Evidence is growing that over the past two years, thousands of patients in hospitals nationwide were likely infected with COVID after being admitted for something else. But as we highlight in this edition of Weekend Reader, investigative stories from <em>Kaiser Health News</em> recently revealed that it’s very hard to hold medical facilities accountable for such developments. That’s because government regulators haven’t been adequately tracking COVID’s spread in medical facilities, and even when apparent COVID infections have been uncovered in hospitals, liability shield laws passed in many states stop those impacted from demanding restitution or reform.</p>

    <li><a href="https://khn.org/news/article/liability-laws-shield-hospitals-from-families-who-believe-loved-ones-contracted-covid-as-patients/"><strong>Laws Shield Hospitals From Families Who Believe Loved Ones Contracted Covid As Patients</strong></a><strong></strong>(Kaiser Health News) <em>— “Throughout the pandemic, lawmakers from coast to coast have passed laws, declared emergency orders or activated state-of-emergency statutes that severely limited families’ ability to seek recourse for lapses in covid-related care. Under such liability shields, legal advocates say, it’s nearly impossible to seek the legal accountability that can pry open information and drive systemic improvements to the infection-control practices that make hospitals safer for patients.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://khn.org/news/article/as-patients-fell-ill-with-covid-inside-hospitals-government-oversight-fell-short/"><strong>As Patients Fell Ill With Covid Inside Hospitals, Government Oversight Fell Short</strong></a> (Kaiser Health News) <em>— “Hospitals, like Riverside, with high rates of covid patients who didn’t have the diagnosis when they were admitted have rarely been held accountable due to multiple gaps in government oversight, a KHN investigation has found. While a federal reporting system closely tracks hospital-acquired infections for MRSA and other bugs, it doesn’t publicly report covid caught in individual hospitals. Medicare officials, tapped by Congress decades ago to ensure quality care in hospitals, also discovered a gaping hole in their authority as covid spread through the nation. They could not force private accreditors — which almost 90% of hospitals pay for oversight — to do targeted infection-control inspections. That means Riverside and nearly 4,200 other hospitals did not receive those specific covid-focused inspections, according to a government watchdog report, even though Medicare asked accreditors to do them in March 2020.”</em></li>

Jail. Here’s What Life Is Like Inside.</strong></a> (Washingtonian) <em>— “Basketball is big — they play on indoor courts now that winter’s here — as is venting about being political prisoners in a totally un-American American gulag (their words). They discuss their cases, interesting facts they’ve discovered in law books (‘At times it sounds like a law firm in here,’ DeGrave says), and the sentences other defendants have received. They know they’re celebrities among a certain set of folks on the outside: Most have crowd-funding accounts set up to help them buy stuff from the commissary or to pay legal bills. DeGrave, whose Patriot’s Pod nickname is Nate Dogg and whose Facebook bio identified him as a ‘Life & Success Hacker,’ has amassed more than $111,537 in his account.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/joe-manchin-big-coal-west-virginia-1280922/"><strong>Manchin's Coal Corruption Is So Much Worse Than You Knew</strong></a><strong></strong>(Rolling Stone) <em>— “The truth is, Manchin is best understood as a grifter from the ancestral home of King Coal. He is a man with coal dust in his veins who has used his political skills to enrich himself, not the people of his state. He drives an Italian-made Maserati, lives on a houseboat on the Potomac River when he is in D.C., pals around with corporate CEOs, and has a net worth of as much as $12 million. More to the point, his wealth has been accumulated through controversial coal-related businesses in his home state, including using his political muscle to keep open the dirtiest coal plant in West Virginia, which paid him nearly $5 million over the past decade in fees for coal handling, as well as costing West Virginia electricity consumers tens of millions of dollars in higher electricity rates… Virginia Canter, who was ethics counsel to Presidents Obama and Clinton, unabashedly calls Manchin’s business operations ‘a grift.’ To Canter, Manchin’s corruption is even more offensive than Donald Trump’s.”</em></li>

They are a collection of Yemenis, Pakistanis, Algerians and others, the majority of whom by the end of 2022 will have spent 20 years in U.S. custody. Many now struggle with chronic health and psychological problems, their attorneys say. If transferred, they will join Sliti and hundreds of others spread across the globe, endeavoring to forge lives after Guantánamo, the discarded men of one of America’s darkest chapters.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-dirty-secret-of-americas-clean-dishes"><strong>The Dirty Secret of America’s Clean Dishes</strong></a><strong></strong>(ProPublica) <em>— “ProPublica analysis found that the EPA effectively allows two dozen BASF plants nationwide to expose an estimated 1.5 million Americans to elevated cancer risks greater than 1 in 1 million. EPA rules also say that plants should never expose people to an additional lifetime cancer risk that exceeds 1 in 10,000. Yet an estimated 2,800 people who live near BASF plants around the country face risks at least that high because of the company’s emissions, according to our analysis… BASF’s footprint of cancer-causing air pollution is larger than that of any other foreign-owned company in the U.S. and is the fourth-largest toxic footprint among all companies operating in this country, according to our analysis.”</em></li>

What for centuries has been a largely taboo or prohibited experience is on the verge of becoming fully legal in majority-minority California and other states. The growing and largely white business of blowing minds adds to the economic distress of poor, non-white communities while denying them access to the powerful mind-altering substances that might help them. The fate of the psychedelic underworld hangs in the balance.”</em></li>

Of whom was less expected as much as more? Who had more eyes and more daggers, more hopes and fears and intentions aimed his way, at his person, his skill and, by extension, his people? Race shouldn’t matter here. But it must, since Hollywood made his race the matter. Movie after movie insisted he be the Black man for white America, which he was fine with, of course. He was Black. But the radical shock of Sidney Poitier was the stress his stardom placed on ‘man.’ Human.”</em></li>
