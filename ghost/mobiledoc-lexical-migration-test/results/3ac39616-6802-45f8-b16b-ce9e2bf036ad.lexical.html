<p>Today, after extensive pressure, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/us/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-biden.html">agreed to cancel</a> at least $10,000 in federal student loan debt for those earning less than $125,000 annually. While the amount is less than many debt cancellation advocates called for, and the plan could face legal challenges, the announcement is a step in the right direction. At last count, the total amount of U.S. student loan debt topped $1.75 trillion.</p>
<p>Biden’s proposal will cost $300 billion. By comparison, the forgivable loans provided to business owners from the COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-small-businesses/paycheck-protection-program">cost more than twice that amount</a>.</p>
<p>Biden’s decision to cancel student debt did not come easily. The president has long been a proponent of saddling Americans with debilitating debt, and, as our team uncovered, his Justice Department has made a habit of fighting student debtor victories in federal court. He has still not fulfilled his promise to stop punishing student debtors in bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>To understand how we got to this point, here is the reporting we have done to hold Biden accountable on the matter:</p>
<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-and-student-debt-a-40-year/"><strong>Biden & Student Debt: A 40-Year Love Affair</strong></a><strong></strong>(Feb. 23, 2021) — <em>“Throughout his career, Biden has had a reputation for being on the side of lenders. Between 2003 and 2008, he took $500,000 from the lending industry. In 2005, he was one of 25 Democrats to sign onto Republican-led bankruptcy reform legislation that removed protections on private student loans. The bill was considered a giveaway to lenders and helped create a $125 billion bubble in private student loan debt. For Biden, that kind of immiseration is not a new cause.”</em></p>

<p>• <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-means-test-con/"><strong>The Means-Test Con</strong></a> (May 2, 2022) — <em>“In trial-ballooning the college debt relief proposal, Biden is boosting the media-manufactured fiction that real, universal college debt relief would mostly help rich Ivy League kids — even though data from the Roosevelt Institute conclusively proves that canceling student debt ‘would provide more benefits to those with fewer economic resources and could play a critical role in addressing the racial wealth gap and building the Black middle class.’”</em></p>
