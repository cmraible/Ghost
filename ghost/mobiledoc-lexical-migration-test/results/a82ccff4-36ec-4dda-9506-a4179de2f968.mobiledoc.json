But this huge oversight has allowed youths to share with other youths how to easily boost Hyundais and Kias through social media. One group based out of Milwaukee which calls itself the “Kia Boyz” is particularly notorious. However, the trend has spread all over the place and so Hyundai is trying to play damage control."
