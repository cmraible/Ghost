            "text": "Hennessey has been teasing the latest addition to their incredible Venom lineup for a long time. In 2014, the Venom made a record-breaking top speed run, which was then bested again by a prototype Venom F5 recently. Indeed, it seems that the Venom was always destined for greatness, but there was one thing standing in the way of the car's popularity. When Hennessey told the world about its ridiculous power output, lightweight, and incredible design, brand fans said it was too good to be true. Being a Texan, John Hennessey wouldn't sit there and listen to people tell him that his car was BS.",

            "text": "That's precisely why, unlike almost every other car made, this vehicle lives up to and surpasses those prototype and concept models whose legendary performance and style gave way to doubt. Nowadays, the effects of Hennessey’s engineering team are pretty straightforward, as the Venom F5 produces a ludicrous horsepower figure similar to that of an F5 Tornado(the car's namesake). Precisely 1817 horsepower is sent to the rear wheels of this incredible hypercar which comes from a massive 6.6-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. Such a wild figure blows cars like the Bugatti Chiron out of the water and even allows for the possibility of an over 300-mile-per-hour top speed.",

What's even crazier is that the brand plans to produce a more track-focused version which is sort of a wild claim as we are not sure how you get any more track-focused than this. However, this car is proof that you shouldn't doubt the claims of Hennessey, no matter how ridiculous or far-out they may seem. One of the craziest parts of this car is the focus on being fast at the track and fun to drive on a regular road. This would put the car in line to compete with models like the Mclaren 720S, except for being way faster. This is a car that blasted through all previously held doubt and shows the world what a dedicated builder can do given the right motivation; great job, Hennessey.",
