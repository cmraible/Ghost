<p>I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too. Thursday I don't care about you. It's Friday I'm in loveâ€¦</p>
<p>â€¦with membership models.</p>
<p>Are they the Cure for journalism's ills? Here's some curated reading about subscriptions, and how to grow them. </p>

<h2 id="theory-of-the-week">Theory of the week</h2>
<p>I'll be honest: I'm not sure I buy the argument made here. It's built on fairly thin evidence. And even if it's correct, it'll only work for a limited subset of very large publications.</p>
<p>But it's still worth a read.</p>

<h2 id="how-amedia-addressed-its-gender-inbalance-in-subscription">How Amedia addressed its gender inbalance in subscription</h2>
<p>It turns out that if you quote more women, more women read your storiesâ€¦ and thus more women subscribe:</p>
<blockquote>In addition, an analysis of the stories from 19 newspapers over the same 21-month period showed that publications which featured more stories containing women sources had higher readership among women, supporting Amediaâ€™s hypothesis that better gender representation makes business sense.</blockquote>
<p>It's <a href="https://blog.wan-ifra.org/2019/11/26/it-s-about-relevance-amedia-s-subscription-strategy-to-engage-women-and-younger-audiences">an interesting case study.</a></p>
<h2 id="newsletters-as-subscriber-targetting-mechanisms">Newsletters as subscriber targetting mechanisms</h2>
<p>Interesting (and not uncommon) approach of using newsletters as a segmentation tool, but with a data influence that's less frequently seen:</p>
<blockquote>The team creates newsletters based on user data. They segment users according to their engagement patterns, history of payments, propensity to buy or churn, and the type of content they like. </blockquote>

<h2 id="newsletter-oops">Newsletter "oops"</h2>
<p>How to completely fail to take adavantage of a major newsletter success:</p>
<blockquote>We finished the 12-week campaign with an average 40% open rate and 7% click-through rate, which were among the highest weâ€™ve ever seen. Without a dedicated subscription offer, it drove three total conversions, which reinforced what we learned with Power on Trial: Every newsletter needs a subscription.</blockquote>

<p>This quote gets to the heart of a detailed look at one publication's journey:</p>
<blockquote>While a move to membership is not about altering the journalistic practices at DoR, it requires a lot of thinking about how we communicate our mission, in order to ensure that our readers and supporters understand the value our work brings into their lives.</blockquote>
<p>It's a useful and compelling story from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/catalinacma">Catalina</a> who is now their digital editor. </p>
