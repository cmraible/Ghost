          "An unnamed Russian billionaire reportedly has sold Adolf Hitler’s limousine to Clive Palmer, an Australian mining magnate and Senate candidate who routinely courts controversy. The bulletproof 1939 Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen limousine infamously used by the Fuhrer has changed hands many times over the past several decades. It’s believed Palmer plans to display the Mercedes-Benz and other recently acquired classic cars in a new museum located in Queensland."

          "With an 8.0-liter inline-eight engine, the 1939 Mercedes-Benz 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen cranks out about 238-horsepower. That might not sound like much these days, but back then it was considered a powerful car, fit enough to transport the ruthless dictator of the Third Reich. It reportedly can hit a top speed of about 118 mph. The driver manages a 5-speed manual transmission, something you wouldn’t find in modern limousines."

It then changed hands at least four times, with the most recent sale taking place in 2017."
