Accentuating that outstanding color combination is seemingly immaculate chrome trim, flaunting the many design flourishes on the exterior, including true wire wheels with knockoffs. A polished steering wheel hub and rich wood rim plus Momo shift knob showcase the excellent design which captivated car shoppers in the early 1960s."

A fiberglass fastback roof really makes these cars look sporty and provides the functionality of a coupe. That was added to a chassis made by Sunbeam while performance tuning was done by George Hartwell Ltd. Authorized Rootes Ltd. dealerships sold Sunbeam Harringtons."
