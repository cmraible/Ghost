<p>While the brightwork is in fantastic shape, a fresh paint job will transform the look of this ride from rough to a real beauty. Those flowing lines, large hood ornament, and classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Buick">Buick</a> hood vents aren’t like anything you find on cars these days. In addition, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/163832/1950-buick-roadmaster">Buick Roadmaster</a> rides lower than you might expect because it has an Art Morrison chassis. Since this build was complete by Icon, it’s definitely over the top.</p>
<p>In addition, the interior already comes wrapped in sumptuous leather, making for a glamorous and luxurious ride. Nestled inside the factory stock dash is a modern stereo, so you can have that convenience without sacrificing aesthetics in the least. Of course, you could just listen to the rumble of the V8, since that’s all the soundtrack a drive of any distance really needs.</p>
<p>Speaking of the engine, the Chevrolet LS7 is a huge step up from the original straight-eight. When this thing rolled off the factory floor it had 152 horsepower on tap. Now, it pushes 353 horsepower, making this ride a real rocket that’s loads of fun on the open road. You get the convenience and performance of a 4L85E automatic transmission, too.</p>
<p>If you haven’t figured it out by now, this Icon Derelict Buick Roadmaster is quite famous, having been profiled on Jay Leno’s Garage. Since the ride is ready for a new owner, you don’t have to deal with the usual waitlist for a Derelict, which is a huge plus. This type of unique vehicle will surely appreciate greatly in value over the years.</p>
