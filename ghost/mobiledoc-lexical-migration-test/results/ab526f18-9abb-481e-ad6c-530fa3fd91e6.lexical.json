If you know the name then you know that it's almost exclusively associated with Ferrari who boasts a line up of some of the world's fastest super and sports cars. Roughly translated to “Road”, it's clear the Sttradale name is an indication that the cars are all about driving. Of course if you needed proof of that then you'd only need to look at the exterior styling of one to really see that even something that wouldn't typically affect the driving flavor of the car was also designed to enrich the driving experience for anyone behind the wheel.",

As is the case with most performance cars of these days, that engine is not made to produce power strictly on its own. Rather it also uses a twin turbo charging system to make upwards of 986 horsepower which is absolutely mind-blowing no matter who you are. All of this performance is kind of expected from the brand but there is one part of it that might shock you.",
