<p>Corvette enthusiasts are more than familiar with Chip Miller, founder of Carlisle events with his business partner Bill Miller (no relation). Miller has owned 80 Corvettes in his lifetime. Sadly, Chip Miller passed away in 2004 of amyloidosis, so his wife Judy and partner Bill started the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation in Chip's honor. One of the biggest events in the country is the Spring Carlisle show, the place to be when it comes to collector and classic cars. Corvettes of Carlisle is the largest gathering in the world, and it attracts about 5,000 Vettes each time.</p>
<p>Exterior-wise, the new C8 Corvette looks like a supercar with plenty of Americana. General Motors hit the ball out of the park with the C8's aerodynamic body design. Featuring the Carbon Flash Exterior Badge Package, this high-powered sports car comes complete with exterior accents, side vents, and front/rear grille accents. More exterior highlights include a unique rear spoiler and front splitter along with front brake cooling inlets, front intermittent wipers, daytime running lamps, LED headlamps, Solar-Ray light-tinted glass, a color-matched removable roof panel, and manual-folding side mirrors with integrated turn signals that are outside-heated and power adjustable. A set of staggered Bright Silver-painted aluminum 5-spoke wheels sit on all four corners and are wrapped with all-season black-wall performance rubber (245/35ZR19 front, 305/30ZR20 rear).</p>
<p>Powering the all-new Vette Z51 is a mid-mounted LT2 6.2-liter V8 engine with direct injection, variable valve timing, and active fuel management. Shifting power is provided by an M1L 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Sitting on an aluminum-structured frame, the Z51 package features a performance rear axle ratio and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Stopping all that power are 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes complete with black-painted brake calipers.</p>
<p>Keeping the Corvette in line and planted to the ground is the FE1 Corvette suspension, all-speed traction control, and active handling stability control. Adding additional rumble and performance is an aluminized stainless steel exhaust with stainless tips. The oil life monitoring system keeps vital signs in check.</p>
<p>Generating a stout 495-horsepower and 470 lb/ft of torque, <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/wina2020c8z51corvette?promo=CHIP720">the new Corvette Z51 </a>can reach a top speed of 184 miles per hour and can sprint from 0 to 60 in just 2.9 seconds. The car can conquered the quarter-mile in just 11.2 seconds during testing. GM may have underrated the power of the new C8 with some dyno testing numbers reading as high as 558-horsepower and 515 lb/ft of torque at the wheels.</p>
<p>Open the doors to reveal GT1 Competition seats with Mulan leather seating with perforated inserts and a leather-wrapped steering wheel complete with power tilt and telescoping functionality. Your favorite songs will play through a Bose 10-spark premium sound system. An 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen displays Chevrolet's latest infotainment systems along with a 12-inch cluster display that can be changed to any color that suits your fancy. Of course, the car is equipped with an HD rear-vision backup camera along with keyless open and start.</p>
