<p>Another Corvette has been involved in a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/florida-man-slams-corvette/">serious accident</a> in Southwest Miami-Dade, sending four people to the hospital. According to a report from local news station WSVN, the May 3 incident happened at around 8:45 pm when the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/impatient-corvette-driver-wrecks/">Corvette was driving recklessly</a>, hitting a minivan.</p>

<p>Police reportedly arrested the Corvette driver not only for reckless driving but also driving without a license. He was also one of those injured and was taken to the hospital. Thankfully, the three adults and one teenager transported to the hospital were all in stable condition. News footage showed people on stretchers being worked on by emergency first responders. We’ve seen far too many fatal accidents like this. If you want to enjoy your performance car, please don’t drive like a complete idiot.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a rash of Corvette accidents like this one lately, but that’s isn’t to say everyone who drives a Corvette is reckless and irresponsible. The same thing has happened with Dodge Challengers/Chargers, Ford Mustangs, and Chevy Camaros in the past. Why these sorts of things seem to come in waves isn’t entirely clear, but we’d love to see this trend come to a close.</p>
<p>Images captured by WSVN makes it appear the Corvette involved in this accident wasn’t a C8 but instead looks like it might have been a C7. There aren’t any great shots of the white sports car, and the front end was obliterated in the crash, so we can’t be entirely sure.</p>
<p>The Honda Odyssey doesn’t look much better, the driver’s side door and sliding passenger door both severely damaged. It’s obvious the Corvette T-boned the minivan on the driver’s side, but we don’t know for sure if this was a case of the Corvette driver blowing through a red light, which seems likely considering the damage.</p>
