Sending that power to the Ford 9-inch rear axle is a six-speed transmission. A custom chassis complete with Scotts Hotrods front suspension and a four-link rear suspension helps provide the kind of torsional rigidity necessary to handle the punishment a tuned Hellcat dishes out. Wilwood disc brakes also help maintain performance balance."
