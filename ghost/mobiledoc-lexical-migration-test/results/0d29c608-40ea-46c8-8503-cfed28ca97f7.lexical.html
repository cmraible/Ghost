<p>When you ask someone to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-911-turbo-s-mclaren-600lt/">name a Porsche</a> off of the top of their head, you will almost always without fail come up with a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/magnus-walker-porsche-911-turbos/">Porsche 911</a>. However, there is one more vehicle that is virtually unparalleled in its performance, as well as its history in Le Mans <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-adds-three-classic-racing-liveries-to-taycan-ev/">racing</a>.</p>
<p>The car that I speak of is, of course, none other than the Porsche 917, with an illustrious past of racing and massive hp and handling capabilities this car quickly became the stuff of legend at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-adam-carolla-check-out-ken-miles-ford-gt40/">Le Mans</a>, and caught the eye of all of those souls lucky enough to see it in person. The car even looked fast, every inch of this car was designed with aerodynamics in mind. Itâ€™s also accounting for the fact that when your car is going an average of 200 mph+ aerodynamics can mean the difference between winning in the first place and finishing dead last.</p>

<p>This Porsche was an absolute beast when it came to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/trans-am-sebring/">endurance racing</a>, competing in the race after race and winning like a boss, and with a top speed of 200mph and a 0-60 time of 2.7-seconds, it was faster than most of its competitors. This car was not boring as it was the top of the line in its industry and that is proven through its sleek styling, lightweight, and monstrous engine pumping out a whopping 520 thick ponies under the hood.</p>
<p>With all that power it was easy peasy to push that nasty automobile to first every time, nothing else could compare to the raw speed and power. This sleek pony zipped through the ranks of supercars are scurried along while others worried about things like losing, this car didn't even know what that meant. Porsche had set out to make a great car that would destroy the competition and that is exactly what they did.</p>
