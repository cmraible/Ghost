One of those recommendations was for new cars to be outfitted with “advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology” or in other words something like breathalyzers. Essentially, everyone would be treated like they’re a repeat DUI offender."

Many media outlets are heralding this as a brave move to curb drunk driving accidents. I think it’s yet another government encroachment on our freedoms."

I think people who drink and drive should face stiff penalties because of the danger they put everyone else in. However, I don’t think the answer is to make you prove to an onboard system in your car you’re not drunk before you can fire up the engine."

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will decide if it’s enforced. If so, automakers would be required to implement such a system. How exactly a vehicle would read your blood alcohol level isn’t entirely clear. Do you have to stick yourself like a diabetic and submit the blood sample into some receptacle? Do you have to blow into a breathalyzer? Whatever it is, I don’t think this is a good idea at all."

They’re using phrases like “crisis levels” of deaths on public roads and drunk driving being “one of the biggest causes.” Again, drunk driving is dangerous and it does kill too many, but so does distracted driving, aggressive driving/road rage, falling asleep, applying makeup, shaving, or doing all sorts of other stupid things behind the wheel. The risk of fatalities doesn't by itself eclipse God-given constitutional rights, even if unelected government officials say they do."

What if the onboard system malfunctions, reads someone’s blood alcohol level as not legal, and that person is stranded? I don’t think the federal government will take any accountability for that or other problems associated with the safety regulation. Will automakers? What will be the net result?"
