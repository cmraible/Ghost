<p>After exposing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-secretive-billionaire-handed-his-fortune-to-the-architect-of-the-right-wing-takeover-of-the-courts/">a historic dark money donation</a>, this week <em>The Lever</em> zeroed in on initiatives that can force dark money groups to disclose their donations and encouraged other news outlets to speak out together. In <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/tax-reform-disclose-act-barre-seid-opinion-1234583123/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, we broke down how to close tax loopholes that subsidize billionaire donations and provided a comprehensive roadmap for reform. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/29/billions-in-dark-money-is-influencing-us-politics-we-need-disclosure-laws?CMP=share_btn_tw"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, we analyzed how and why media outlets should step up their advocacy for stronger dark money disclosure laws.</p>
<p>In keeping with our work shedding light on matters that have long been kept in the dark, this week we also reported on a little-known but major player in the U.S. health care system that determines who gets access to life-saving medication. Moreover, we examined the machinations of the military-student-debt complex, exposed new outcry over Biden’s Department of Justice targeting student debtors, and revealed how Rhode Island Treasurer Seth Magaziner’s pro-Wall Street investment strategy is now helping his congressional campaign.</p>
