Everything from the beautifully crafted leaf springs, which were designed specifically to eliminate the need for a traction bar, to the high output Hemis that we know and love today. These cars have been used in everything however some of the more favorable settings include stock car racing, drag racing, and even pro-touring. It isn't uncommon to go to the drag strip and see a lineup of these muscle-bound Mopar monsters. However, it isn't every day that you get to experience the insane head trip that is this classic Road Runner, it's more than just a set of nice ",

With such an incredible engine driving this beast down the drag strip one would expect the rest of the car to be just as flamboyant and loud. Of course, you'd be right. All of the suspension parts have been upgraded to handle that intense engine and a beefed-up Dana 60 rear end helps to keep the car planted.",

You’ll find a Road Runner logo on the steering wheel as well as the back wall of the car. One of the coolest “easter eggs” that this car is equipped with is the “meep meep” horn which mimics the sound made by the Road Runner in the classic Roadrunner and Wile E Coyote cartoons.
