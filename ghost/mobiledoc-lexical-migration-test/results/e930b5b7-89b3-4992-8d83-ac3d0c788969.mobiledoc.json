The first of 7 special editions, the 2023 Dodge Challenger Shakedown, promises some exclusivity with production capped at 1,000 units. Unfortunately, Dodge has decided to just give us some cosmetic upgrades and nothing performance-wise, making us less than excited."

We were just hoping the last sendoff for the Challenger and Charger would boost power to ridiculous levels, not just give everyone some cosmetic packages. There’s still time for more power, so hopefully that happens, because the Mopar muscle twins deserve that kind of a sendoff."
