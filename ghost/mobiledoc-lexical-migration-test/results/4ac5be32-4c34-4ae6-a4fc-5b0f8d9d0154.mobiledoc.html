<hr>
<p>The 1995 Dodge Viper was essentially another carryover from '94 since production had steadily increased since its inception. Production was half that of the previous year with Dodge focusing on the next iteration of the modern day Cobra. The color Dandelion Yellow's name changed to Viper Bright Yellow probably as a marketing tactic to cater to their male demographic.</p>
<p>1995 was the last year for 1st Generation Viper. Originally engineered to be a performance car, the Viper had no exterior-mounted door handles or key cylinders and no air conditioning (however, this was added as an option in later models, and climate controls featured a "snowflake" icon, which indicated a potential setting for the A/C). The roof was made from canvas, and the windows were made from vinyl using zippers to open and close, much like the Jeep Wrangler. However, the Viper was still equipped with some domestic features, including manually-adjustable leather-trimmed sport bucket seats with lumbar support, an AM-FM stereo cassette player with clock and high fidelity sound system, and interior carpeting. Aluminium alloy wheels were larger in diameter due to the larger brakes. A lightweight fiberglass hard roof option on later models was also available to cover the canvas soft roof, and was shipped with each new car. There were also no airbags, in the interest of weight reduction. Adjustable performance suspension was also an available option for most Vipers.</p>
