But it seems like the Mopar crowd is the most loyal among modern enthusiasts, at least according to the recently IHS Markit’s 26th annual Automotive Loyalty awards program. Ford and Chevy fans, don’t get mad at us, we’re just passing on what IHS concluded."

It’s possible the new vehicle is a replacement, but it might be an addition to what the household already has.  The survey was limited to the United States and the year 2021."
