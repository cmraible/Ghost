The shape has been finessed with the rounded headlights integrated into its fenders and any sharp lines smoothed out for a sleeker look. Its also sits hunched forward in a typical drag car pose on a set of Coys black alloy wheels."

The interior is rather spacious with the rear bench providing some practicality to this classic. A new Pioneer stereo and power steering are the only additional luxuries in this cabin."

There’s no work on power output, but we’d expect it to be significant. The transmission is a 700R4 automatic with overdrive that directs power toward the rear wheels."
