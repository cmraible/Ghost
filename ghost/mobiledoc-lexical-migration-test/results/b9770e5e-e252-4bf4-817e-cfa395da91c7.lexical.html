<p>This weekend, <em>The Daily Poster <a href="/dems-have-a-scotus-opportunity-tomorrow/">reported</a></em> on Mitch McConnell’s plan to adjourn the Senate for the next two weeks in order to prevent Democrats from trying to take over the Senate and throw a wrench into the GOP’s effort to confirm Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Amy Barrett. That GOP plan was put in motion on Monday, when Senate Democrats <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/519708-senate-leaves-town-for-two-weeks-amid-coronavirus-outbreak">agreed</a> to let the Republican adjournment motion pass.</p>
<p>On its face, this looks like another retreat in a long line of such retreats — which shouldn’t be surprising. Among Democratic strategists in Washington, there are always reasons to preemptively surrender and live to never fight another day.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVEuY8xrTU&feature=youtu.be">new digital ad</a> out from the Center for Popular Democracy that is ratcheting up pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to be more aggressive in trying to stop the Barrett nomination.</p>

<h4 id="adjourn-or-stay-and-fight"><strong>Adjourn Or Stay And Fight?</strong></h4>
<p>The argument to allow adjournment was that if Senate Democrats objected, it wouldn’t do much — it would simply leave the Senate floor open, but Republicans could then just decide to not show up to allow a quorum, meaning nothing gets done anyway.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s true, but there are two problems with that argument.</p>
<p>1) It wasn’t all that long ago that the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-02-25-mn-45210-story.html">invoked</a> longstanding Senate rules to have arrest warrants issued to bring Republican senators back to the floor when they refuse to show up to do their jobs. That’s definitely a hardball tactic, and it’s not entirely clear it would work. But this is a fight over a lifetime Supreme Court appointment, so shouldn’t all options be on the table?</p>
<p>2) By agreeing to a two-week adjournment, it becomes harder for Democrats to argue that the GOP is stalling a much-needed COVID relief package. After all, if Democrats are insisting a package is necessary, then why did they agree to a Republican plan to take a two-week vacation?</p>
<p>There is one potential benefit of the hiatus — the two-week adjournment likely makes the Barrett confirmation schedule <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-covid-outbreak-republican-margin-for-error-barrett-confirmation/">extremely tight</a>. Basically, McConnell probably now has a margin of error of just seven days between Barrett confirmation votes and the November election. That means if there are any other obstacles for his conference, it could screw up his entire plan.</p>
<h4 id="mcconnell-is-willing-to-create-another-super-spreader-situation"><strong>McConnell Is Willing To Create Another Super-Spreader Situation</strong></h4>
<p>Of course, “obstacle” is a subjective term.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks after the GOP turned Barrett’s nomination announcement into a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/04/politics/gallery/barrett-announcement-inside-white-house-0926/index.html">mask-free</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/03/us/rose-garden-event-covid.html">super-spreader event</a>, Senate Republicans seem more than willing to risk engineering yet another COVID super-spreader event to confirm Barrett.</p>
<p>Indeed, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who has tested positive for COVID, said yesterday that he is <a href="https://www.axios.com/ron-johnson-covid-19-supreme-court-60996c74-4c5f-4ffd-9ba9-93d5f9d89a84.html">happy</a> to break quarantine and go into the Senate to cast a vote for Barrett -- and would wear “a moon suit” if necessary. Meanwhile, McConnell’s office is now openly <a href="https://twitter.com/DougAndres/status/1313126169341030402?s=20">scoffing</a> at Schumer’s request for senators and staff to adhere to basic health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is exactly what some of us said right after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away: Democrats must use whatever power they have to delay the confirmation process, and they are going to have to be as aggressive in stopping the confirmation as the GOP is in pushing it.</p>
<p>If a COVID-positive Republican senator says he is willing to put on a <a href="https://www.axios.com/ron-johnson-covid-19-supreme-court-60996c74-4c5f-4ffd-9ba9-93d5f9d89a84.html">space suit</a> in order to jam a confirmation through the Senate, then Democratic senators need to be willing to put on space suits to use procedural maneuvers to stall. And House Democrats need to stop sitting on their hands, and start using their own power to gum up the Senate works. And yes — <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/09/24/memo-laying-out-delay-tactics-circulates-among-senate-democrats/">they have power</a>.</p>
<p>To be sure, Democrats will have to be innovative, nimble and aggressive in ways they haven’t ever been in my lifetime. This is a party that so often seems more interested in just going back to brunch than in trying to wield power. But everything is on the line here.</p>
<p>I know everyone wants to believe that defeating Trump in the election will erase everything, but that’s not true. Yes, Trump has to be defeated. But the Supreme Court confirmation process over the next few weeks could quite literally decide jurisprudence for the rest of our lives, regardless of what happens in the presidential campaign. So the battle for the future of this country and the planet is happening on two fronts — the election <em>and</em> the confirmation.</p>
<p>Democrats must be forced to fight — if they don’t, we’re doomed.</p>
