Track-ready, this sports car is stylish and comfortable enough to take for a loud, head-turning cruise through town or a white-knuckled jaunt on country roads. This is the car for someone who wants something unique and wildly entertaining."

It’s also been upgraded with a 4bbl carb, Edelbrock intake, headers, and a nice dual exhaust system. The seller is claiming this setup is good for 451-horsepower, a figure which sounds very realistic. A TH350 three-speed automatic transmission takes human error out of gear transitions."

Also unusual is the Camaro-inspired rear wing and taillights. Observant drivers will also note the roll cage visible through the back glass, a sign this is no ordinary Nissan Z."

This Datsun’s interior has racing harnesses and seats, B&M ratchet shifter, and a fire extinguisher, but it also comes with some surprising creature comforts. One of the big ones is a slick stereo with a pop-up LCD screen, CD player, XM Radio, and an auxiliary input."
