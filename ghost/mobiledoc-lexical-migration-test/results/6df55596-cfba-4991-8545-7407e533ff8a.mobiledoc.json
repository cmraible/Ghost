From there, this Jeep then received Davis Autosports' Stage 2 upgrade treatment adding a three-inch lift along with Jeep's Moab-style Wrangler wheels wrapped in meaty 265/75R16 all-terrain tires. The rocker panels, bumpers and fender flares are all covered in Kevlar protection, and the Cherokee's styling is finished off with LED headlights and a roof carrier. "
