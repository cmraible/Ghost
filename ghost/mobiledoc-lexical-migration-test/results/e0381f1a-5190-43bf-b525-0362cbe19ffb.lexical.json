The market for these Italian collectibles fluctuated over the years, but now the value has been on a steady incline. Tripling in price from 2010, the 5300 GT Strada in mint shape is about $1.2 million, and a Bizzarrini 5300 GT America is worth about $850,000 US in immaculate condition which is over two and a half times what it was back in 2010. These cars are rarely made public with sales usually dealt privately among collectors, and the good old American V8 makes them much easier to repair than any Ferrari.",
