<hr>
<p>After an impressive career as a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/celebrity/">musician</a>, there's no doubt that John Oates of Hall & Oates has owned plenty of cool cars in his day, but the 1984 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2019-porsche-911-speedster-covid19-auction/">Porsche 911</a> you see here sounds like it's the one that has had the most sentimental attachment. The problem is that he sold this car back in 1990, and the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/singer-porsche-911-warren-commission/">Porsche</a> Club of America recently documented his successful efforts to reacquire this classic 911.</p>

<p>Oates bought the car in 1984 using Porsche's Special Wishes – today known as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-911-fingerprint/">Porsche Exclusive</a> – that allows for personalization, and he had the car spec'd with pearl white paint, soft grey leather interior, turbo wheels and a lowered stance. One of the first things he did in the car was go out on a date with a woman named Aimee, who is now his wife, so needless to say, this car holds a special place in their relationship.</p>
<p>When the couple was looking for a unique way to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, they decided they would auction off their restored and vintage-raced 1984 Tiga SC84 Sports 2000 racecar for charity at the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/so-what-happened-at-the-amelia-island-actions/">2020 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance</a>. It was around this time that they stumbled upon the old 911 using social media, and they were able to buy the car. Since they found the 1984 Porsche 911 at the same time they decided to auction off the Tiga, which ended up <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/am20/amelia-island/lots/r0075-1984-tiga-sc84-sports-2000/847381">selling for $45,000</a> through <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rm-sothebys-achieves-more-than-35-8-million-in-amelia-island-with-best-of-category-motor-cars/">RM Sotheby's</a> to benefit the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance Foundation, Oates now calls the 911 his Karma Carrera.</p>
<p>Following his purchase of his old 911, he had a period-correct restoration to Porsche Classic Technical Certificate standards. As you can see, the result is an incredibly original, show-worthy Porsche.</p>
