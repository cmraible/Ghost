He’s talking about how it produces a paltry amount of horsepower and more importantly torque, so it’s really not fit for driving through the mud, but he’s going to do it anyway. Also, those big tires are all wrong for mudding, so they won’t provide all that much in the way of traction. Pretty much this is a bad idea and it’s like they’re reveling in it, just like what the boys on Jackass used to do."
