However, even with the factory supposedly running “at capacity” it’s not enough to keep up with demand. That’s not necessarily a bad position for the automaker to be in, since high demand helps ensure cars aren’t just sitting at dealerships for months on end. However, GM risks angering enthusiasts if they have to wait too long to get a car. It’s a delicate dance for one of the hottest performance vehicles on the market."
