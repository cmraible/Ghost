There’s no real indication of this engine swap on the exterior, so other people on the street or at a show would be none the wiser, until you either punch it or pop the SS hood to show off. This Camaro still wears its SS and 350 badges, so it has an original feel."

This Camaro is impressive but avoids being too flashy, thanks to that Fathom Blue body with White stripe. Chevrolet didn’t encrust the ’68 Camaro with a bunch of chrome, either, and this car stays true to that philosophy of understatement. American Racing Torque Thrust wheels pair very nicely with everything else."
