Considering this kid was dealing with Arkansas State Police, which has shown time and again how good it is at chasing down and stopping fleeing suspects, he was in for a rude awakening.",

After all, they likely got the license plate number when they pulled over the Corvette and know it’s registered to the father, so the natural assumption would be that he was the one driving. Hopefully that mess would’ve been sorted out quickly, but it would at least have made for some tense, disturbing moments. We’re wondering if dad realized that and thanked his son for being so thoughtful.",
