It could be soon, if a report from <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-04/apple-s-planned-iwatch-could-be-more-profitable-than-tv.html\">Bloomberg</a> turns out to be accurate. The news outlet claims that Apple plans to release its highly-anticipated iWatch &#8220;as soon as this year,&#8221; which means Apple needs to get a move on if it plans to kick the smart watch revolution into high gear.</p>\n<p>Ever since wearable computing started to pick up steam again &#8212; with the FitBit, Nike&#8217;s Fuel band, the <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2013/01/09/pebble-watch-scheduled-to-ship-on-january-23/\">Pebble</a> watch, and the introduction of <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2013/02/22/google-glass-will-go-on-sale-later-this-year/\">Google&#8217;s Glass</a> project &#8212; rumors have run rampant that Apple also plans to make a splash in the wearable space. An iWatch that runs some variant of iOS and interacts with other iDevices would certainly catch the attention of consumers, and with Apple&#8217;s design experience, an iWatch could look more like a fashion accessory than a miniature computer strapped to your wrist.</p>\n<p>And with the watch industry experiencing a resurgence, there might not be a better time for Apple to jump into this unfamiliar territory and leave its mark. Bloomberg cites the shares of two watch makers &#8212; Fossil and Movado Group, Inc. &#8212; whose stock prices have tripled since 2009. The watch appears to be making a comeback. If Apple is indeed working on an iWatch, it could not only join the movement, it could spearhead the effort to make watches much smarter.</p>\n<p>In terms of Apple&#8217;s war against Google, I think Apple might have a slight edge in terms of the stigma surrounding its wearable computing product. Most people don&#8217;t have an issue with someone else wearing a watch, but it can be a tiny bit unsettling to see someone wearing a Google Glass lens. It&#8217;s almost like looking at some sort of futuristic robot/human hybrid with a HUD that displays vitals and identifies targets. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RobertScoble/posts/428290853931433?comment_id=67888351&amp;notif_t=share_reply\">Robert Scoble</a> said it best in a Facebook post: if Google Glass has a problem, it&#8217;ll be a dork vs. regular person problem. He&#8217;s not sure if Glass could escape that. Watches, however, have been around for a long, long time. They feel familiar. They don&#8217;t feel threatening. If a smart watch is the wearable Apple plans to push, I think it&#8217;s a good choice.</p>\n<p>If Bloomberg&#8217;s timeline is accurate, Apple has a bit less than ten full months to get an iWatch manufactured and onto shelves before the year is up. We&#8217;ll keep you up to date if we hear anything more about this product. Until then, stay tuned.</p>\n"
