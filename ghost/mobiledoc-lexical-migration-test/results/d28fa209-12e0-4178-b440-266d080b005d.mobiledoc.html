<p>With only 500 McLaren Sennas produced, each of these cars have become instant modern classics. This particular car is number 2 and has a mere 203 miles on the odometer. It’s also one-of-a-kind with a whole range of options. Perhaps the most expensive and impressive of them is a full visual exposed carbon fiber body, which cost $297,575. To show that off, the car wears Transparent Fux Green paint plus Emerald Green tinted carbon, and the combination is amazing.</p>
<p>Slotted behind the seats for excellent balance is an aluminum M840TR 90 4.0-liter V8 engine. It works with a twin-scroll twin-turbo setup and dry sump lubrication. The result is a peak 789-horsepower and 590 lb.-ft. of torque. Using a 7-speed dual-clutch SSG transmission, this McLaren can do 0-60 in 2.7 seconds and hit 211 mph.</p>
<p>Of course, a car like this is about more than just power. It’s been engineered to handle excellently on tracks at high speeds, offering the kind of precision you normally wouldn’t expect from a road car. A carbon-fiber Monocage III chassis with extruded aluminum subframe, electrohydraulic rack-and-pinion steering, as well as aero enhancements like the prominent front splitter, diffuser, and rear wing help greatly with that objective.</p>
<p>Just like the exterior, the interior wears Emerald Green tinted carbon and Fux Green, plus it is bespoke, another upgrade for the Senna. White leather with green contrast stitching graces the seats, door panels, dash, and steering wheel. A Bowers and Wilkins seven-speaker sound system is great for cruising through the city, while the McLaren Track Telemetry system will help you shave off valuable seconds from your hot lap times.</p>
<p>It’s not possible to emphasize just how revolutionary the McLaren Senna is, with its influence no doubt to be felt in other hypercars for years to come. Even for MacLaren’s Ultimate Series cars, it’s quite impressive.
