Driving on these pads also charges a meter at the bottom of the screen which, when full, can be used as a boost that you can trigger whenever you want. This boost also doubles as an offensive dash that’ll knock out opponents if you touch them and as a shield to protect yourself from other racers trying to do the same to you. Most of these boost pads are set up in long straight sections of the track so you can constantly chain these boosts together to either leave your opponents in the dust or catch up and eliminate the competition if you are behind. Annoyingly though, most of these sections are immediately followed by a ninety degree turn that thins out the track which means if you aren’t pixel perfect with your positioning and drifting, you’re either going to be scrapping your vehicle up against the wall and losing a lot of your vehicles shield, making you more vulnerable or downright crashing and losing all the advantage you just gained. It’s brutal and not in a fun way."

At the end of each race, your Switch profile will gain experience and you will unlock something new every time you reach a new level. This profile level system is implemented in the most annoying way possible; at level one, you only have access to one character, cup races and time trials. Imagine my surprise when a friend of mine came over the day I got this to help me review the multiplayer, only for the multiplayer to be locked behind an experience grind. Granted, I only needed to reach level two to unlock it but the fact that I had to unlock multiplayer in the first place is baffling. People hate it when things like fighting games have locked characters because it locks them out of basic gameplay elements that should be there from the start. Well, "

Some tracks are competently designed where you have some decent straights to build speed and turns that are satisfying to master but other times, you get very basic oval shaped tracks which are fine, it’s just I wasn’t expecting a game with so little tracks to have so many and some tracks are designed to just be annoying. Expect to run into turns so tight you have to be pixel perfect to not mess up in any way - straights too short to build your speed efficiently; columns of light that cause instant crashes if you hit that have hitboxes so large that I’m convinced are bugged; weather effects so aggressive that you have to rely entirely on the minimap because you can’t see three feet in front of you and spiral turns that are angled in such a way that you have to mash the drift button to get through it reliably.
