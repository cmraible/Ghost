<hr>
<p>Across the five auction houses holding events on the Monterey peninsula, a total of 956 cars will be up for grabs. The classic car sales results are already expected to smash records, according to Hagerty Automotive Intelligence. The current all-time high record is $395 million, and the comeback event last year pulled in $351 million. So which cars could push that number over the line? It’s likely to be this bunch.</p>
