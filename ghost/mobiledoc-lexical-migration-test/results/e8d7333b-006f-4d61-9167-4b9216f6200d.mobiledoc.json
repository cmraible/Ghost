This information is known because the car comes with a  certificate of authenticity from Ford as well as the Monroney sticker showing its original MSRP of $20,246. Looking at current prices of these '93 Cobras, you're probably going to need a much larger amount of money to get the winning bid on this car."

The SVT Cobra started with the Mustang GT Coupe (no convertible Cobras in 1993), and the 5.0-liter V8 received GT-40 heads from Ford Racing, upgraded intake manifold and camshaft and a performance exhaust helping boost the Cobra's power output to 235 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque – the 1993 Mustang GT was rated at 205 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque."

The Cobra has larger vented disc brakes (10.84 inches front and 10.07 inches rear) than the Mustang GT, and the front struts were modified for improved cornering. In total, the Mustang SVT Cobra was able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds."

This was the hottest Fox Body Mustang ever made, and now's your chance to add this rare, souped-up Mustang to your collection."
