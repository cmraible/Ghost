Its curvaceous British bodywork is detailed with muscular American traits such as flared wheel arches and a huge side exit exhaust pipe. Complete with stainless steel rollover hoop, this Shelby appears as race ready as it did back in the 1960s."

That means this little sports car packs a 550-horsepower punch! A five-speed Tremec TKO600 manual transmission channels that power to the rear wheels for a pure experience behind the wheel. We’re willing to bet that it sounds incredible, too!"

These Shelby Cobras proved competitive in motorsport, but the installation of an even larger 4.7-liter V8 engine meant the the car could fight with the Jaguars and Aston Martins of Europe.
