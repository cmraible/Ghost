So if you’re only publishing, at most, a few articles per week and don’t have an enormous social following, chances are your content is getting lost in the noise.\n\nThis is a new reality we’re living in that’s going to make it ever harder to build destination sites. What’s becoming important is finding ways to expose your ideas to a wider audience, and that now means, inevitably, working with other platforms to spread your writing and content.\n\nI suspect that people working in video are well ahead of those of us who are more text-centric here. Do you know anyone working in video who isn’t uploading to Vimeo, YouTube or Vine?\n\n\n## Porous websites\n\nWe’ve talked for a long time about sites having “fuzzy” boundaries – that content diffuses beyond the “wall” of the website – but now we’re seeing that spreading further. I’m fascinated by the way [Euan Semple](http://euansemple.com/theobvious/) cross-posts everything he writes to [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+EuanSemple/posts), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/euan.semple), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/1701?trk=prof-sm) and his own blog. He’s *clearly* more interested in sharing his ideas than building website *per se*.\n\nAnd that’s a difficult idea for those of us from a publication background to adjust to.\n\n\n"
