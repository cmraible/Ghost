Powering that incredible mid-engine racing legend was an imposing car both for its looks and the V8 powerhouse, but today we aim to talk about a different vehicle that bears the same name. This sister car is also one of Ford's finest cars from what is considered the best time for innovation in the brand. That's right, it's a Mustang, but it is, of course, no ordinary first-gen cruiser or straight line speedster. Instead, road racing and Trans Am racing is what this superb car was made for, and, as you can imagine, it does it exceptionally well. So let's take a look at what makes this such an insane American pony car.",

These include upgraded springs, shocks, and chassis reinforcement, but the exciting stuff lies with the more minor details. One such detail is the front end which has been chopped to ride about an inch shorter than stock. This was a trick used by Trans Am racers at the time, and now it lives on through the car as an homage to the greatness of previous generations.
