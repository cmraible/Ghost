          " from Dume Games Studio has finally come into orbit on the Nintendo Switch having been announced earlier in 2022. The look is basic but striking and is marketed as a 1-bit metroidvania; think the ZX Spectrum era. Why make a 1-bit game in 2022 I hear you ask? ‘Well, why not?’ I counter, especially when it looks so cool!"

          "is a metroidvania experience through-and-through as you play as a cute little astronaut who crash lands on a mysterious planet. The plot is not really elaborated upon but you begin with a full suite of powers (a dash, a jetpack etc) and you think ‘Wow, this is pretty easy’. But not for long… An evil being on the planet strips the little astronaut of all of their equipment and abilities and soon, all you have left is the ability to jump and shoot. This leads me into the first positive, to start with, Astronite is HARD. You get thrown in at the deep end which, for me, is refreshing; Dume Games certainly don’t want to make your life easy! There aren’t even any health pickups, meaning each trek from save point to save point is an ordeal, but a very rewarding and balanced one at that."

Once you receive the key to these rooms, you can track them down and complete a little arcade-inspired mini-game. One has you being chased by ghosts à la Pacman, and another has you deflecting a ball up and down the screen like Breakout. These are all incredibly fun and show that Astronite doesn’t take itself too seriously."

This is all pretty typical however, one limitation here is there is no way to bank the currency and therefore, immunise yourself from losing it upon your death. What this means is that when you come to a boss encounter, you just know you’ll die a few times, especially early in the game. So if you come to the point of a boss (which is always telegraphed so you know it’s coming) and have a decent amount of shpirti in your pocket, then you’re more likely to go away and farm more shpirti so you can spend it on the next most expensive item in the shop, rather than inevitably lose it all in the boss fight. I just felt this mechanic completely broke the rhythm of the game."
