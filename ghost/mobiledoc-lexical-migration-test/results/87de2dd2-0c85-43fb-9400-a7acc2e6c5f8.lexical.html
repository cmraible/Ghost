<p>Friends:</p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster </em>recently published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-government-just-admitted-an-inconvenient-truth/"><strong>story</strong></a> revealing a surprising admission from the Republican-run Congressional Budget Office: Corporate health care is immiserating millions of Americans, and a Medicare for All-style system could fix the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/686823914"><strong>our new video</strong></a> about the CBO report — and then <strong>share it on social media</strong> and forward this email to friends and family.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to health insurance CEOs or lobbyists. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-government-just-admitted-an-inconvenient-truth/"><strong>this</strong></a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/newsoms-big-choice-single-payer-or-his-insurance-donors/"><strong>this</strong></a> that corporate health care interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>We can also show how President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have the power to scrap our current medical system and build one that works for everyone — but so far haven’t even considered passing the public option plan Biden <a href="https://joebiden.com/healthcare/">touted</a> on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>The only way for our elected officials to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
