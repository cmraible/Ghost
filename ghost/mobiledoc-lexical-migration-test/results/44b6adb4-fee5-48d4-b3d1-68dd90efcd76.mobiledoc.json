This was the beginning of Honda's success in racing, as well as Japan's. It also contributed greatly to Honda's brand recognition worldwide. Takahashi suffered a major crash at the Isle of Man TT in 1962. He never fully recovered from his injuries and retired from motorcycle racing two years later. He wasn't done with racing, however. He moved from two wheels to four, found racing success in the 1980s with Nissan, and even competed in a Formula 1 race as well as the 24 Hours of LeMans."
