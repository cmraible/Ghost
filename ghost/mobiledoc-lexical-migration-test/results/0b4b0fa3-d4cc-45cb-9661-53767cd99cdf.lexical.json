In the right-hand lane, you can see a brightly colored yellow Nova with a sleek black C6 Corvette to its left. Clearly, neither of these vehicles is stock as they jump off the line with incredible aptitude. After a tough race where both cars were basically neck and neck the whole time, it's hard to tell who won because the camera was a little out of focus, but the right sign lit up first, so we'll call it a win for the Nova. This was a great race where both drivers did really well, but what about one where the win was taken by a slightly newer model?",

In the end, the Viper finished the quarter-mile in just 9.22 seconds, with the Chevy landing in the low 10-second range.

Soon the lights went from yellow to green, and in a display of what can only be described as sheer power, both pony cars ripped through a set of tires trying to beat the other in the first 60 feet.

If this video shows us anything, it doesn't matter what car you drive; it's about the work you put into it to get it to where you want it. The 1970 Challenger may have been the slowest vehicle I just talked about, but it's still about as fast as a stock hellcat, making it the perfect example of built-over-bought.",
