Coming standard with the Z51 packages are an electronic limited-slip differential, a performance ratio rear axle, and Brembo anti-lock brakes that take the new Corvette’s performance capabilities to an all new level. Meanwhile a Carbon Flash painted nacelles and Carbon Flash painted 5-open-spoke aluminum wheels, a rear spoiler, and a hard top that can be operated at speeds of up to 30-mph add even more style and performance.
