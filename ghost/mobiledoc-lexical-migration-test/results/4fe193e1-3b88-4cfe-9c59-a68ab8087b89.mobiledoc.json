While that certainly can be jarring, this creation known as the Chevy 789 takes parts from 3 different classic Chevrolets and mixes them together for one crazy look. It’s something which people will definitely stare at, whether in horror or out of fascination."

The guy wasn’t content with the looks, so he chopped it up and added parts from a ’57, ’58, and ’59 Chevy as well as what he claims is “1500 lbs. of clay” (really it’s carbon fiber and fiberglass) to come up with what you see."

The middle of the car is a ’58 Chevy, and the rear is obviously from a ’59 Chevy with the distinctive wings. All these looks were melded together into one, something which we’re sure wasn’t easy to pull off."

It’s disappointing to see those seats and plenty of plastic after being presented with such a unique, interesting exterior. We hope Langmesser sees fit to continue working on the Chevy 789 by revamping that space with something more vintage."
