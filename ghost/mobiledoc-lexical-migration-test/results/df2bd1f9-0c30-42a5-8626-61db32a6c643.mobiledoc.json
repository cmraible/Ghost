The rear window was modified to drop down quickly, so Capone and his men could fire on pursuers in a surprise attack. Heavy spring lifts allow the rear windows to roll down so occupants could fit a barrel through. Even more interesting, the glass could roll up about an extra inch, exposing a circular cutout in the glass big enough to fit a machine gun muzzle, providing a secure way to return fire."
