<p>A new <a href="https://ericohrn.sites.grinnell.edu/files/exec_comp/ohrn_tax_breaks_exec_comp_2021_2.pdf">study</a> finds that when Congress enacts corporate tax cuts in the name of helping workers, a handful of top corporate executives end up pocketing a disproportionate share of the cash. “For every dollar the tax breaks generate for a firm, compensation awarded to the highest-paid executives at the firm increases by between 15 and 19 cents,” notes the report from Grinnell economist Eric Ohrn.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>New York lawmakers this morning sent a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqxubtdfejdfypw/Letter%20to%20governor%20re%20book%20contract.pdf?dl=0">letter</a> demanding Gov. Andrew Cuomo stop hiding the financial terms of his latest book deal ― and they raised questions about whether the agreement intertwined with the Cuomo administration’s decision to withhold damning information about nursing home deaths in the state.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/andrew-cuomo-pandemic-memoir-fetched-seven-figure-advance"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> recently reported that Cuomo may be raking in seven figures for the book, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/nyregion/cuomo-book.html">passages</a> touting his leadership during the coronavirus outbreak were buttressed by his administration’s undercounting of nursing home deaths. Cuomo has refused to disclose how much he is getting paid for the book by its publisher, which said Monday it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/nyregion/cuomo-book.html">stopped</a> promoting the volume because of the nursing home scandal.</p>
<p>“Your administration actively worked to suppress data around thousands of nursing home deaths in the report issued by [the New York Department of Health] on July 6, 2020. The announcement of your aforementioned book publication came just over one month later,” the Democratic legislators <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqxubtdfejdfypw/Letter%20to%20governor%20re%20book%20contract.pdf?dl=0">wrote</a>. “In New York State, the Public Officers Law explicitly prohibits the solicitation of gifts, or otherwise opportunities for personal financial gain, at the expense of influencing or obstructing government operations against the general welfare of the people of this state. Therefore, it is imperative that these documents are unveiled for the public to ascertain whether such solicitation occurred.”</p>
<p>In one section of the book, Cuomo insists that “New York was No. 46 out of 50 in the nation when it came to percentage of deaths in nursing homes.” However, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/nyregion/cuomo-book.html">N</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/nyregion/cuomo-book.html"><em>ew York Times</em></a> notes that “New York’s actual position in a ranking of states would have been worse had the true toll — about 50 percent higher than he had revealed — been included in the analysis.”</p>
<p>This is not Cuomo’s first problematic book deal. A few years ago, Cuomo <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/book-deal-andrew-cuomo-backed-bills-helped-news-corporation-1827328">supported legislation</a> that benefited the mass media company News Corporation, whose subsidiary then gave him a lucrative advance for his first book. After that book was published, Cuomo’s administration also <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/news-corporation-gets-taxpayer-support-after-giving-andrew-cuomo-big-book-deal">backed</a> special tax subsidies for News Corporation.</p>
<p>When this arrangement was originally revealed in 2015, Cuomo did not release his book contract for public review. Ultimately, the News Corporation subsidiary <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/how-did-cuomo-make-783-000-on-memoir-that-sold-3-200-copies/article_4004f104-3d88-5364-968c-05f89d12bede.html">paid</a> Cuomo nearly $800,000 for a book that sold only 3,200 copies.</p>

<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback"><strong>TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</strong></h4>
<p>During the 2018 election cycle, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and former Rep. Joe Crowley <a href="https://twitter.com/_waleedshahid/status/1367686675560796162?s=20">got the Women’s Equality Party line</a> on the ballot in races against Cynthia Nixon and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Women’s Equality Party was founded by Cuomo as a tool to undermine his challenger Zephyr Teachout in 2014.</p>
<h4 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• PROGRESSIVES TAKE OVER NEVADA; DEM. ESTABLISHMENT RAGE QUITS:</strong> As <em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vegas-is-an-amazing-place-for-progressives/">reported last week</a></em>, Nevada progressives were primed to prosper during their state Democratic Party’s leadership elections on March 6. Sure enough, candidates backed by the Democratic Socialists of America <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/whitmer-picked-to-lead-nevada-democrats-in-major-power-shift-2296277/">won all five positions</a> up for grabs. They now control statewide strategy, hiring decisions, and the party platform. In the wake of the progressives' victory, the<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/08/nevada-democratic-party-dsa/"> entire staff of the Nevada Democratic Party quit</a>, taking severance with them. Worse, the old guard<a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/say-goodbye-to-the-most-effective-democratic-party-in-the-country"> had transferred $450,000 from the party</a> to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s account in preparation for the loss. Still, new party chair Judith Whitmer is relishing her group’s victory. “Our slate’s success is the direct result of a year-long grassroots organizing effort,” she told <em>The Daily Poster.</em> “We’ve been intentional since day one about building the authentic relationships required to amass a winning coalition, and it’s paid off.”</p>
<p><strong>• U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TACITLY ENDORSES INSURRECTION: </strong>After the Capitol insurrection, a number of major corporations announced that they were ending PAC donations to the various Republican lawmakers who helped cast doubt on the election results and encouraged the mob. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1367958621137629188?s=20">recently</a> sent out a memo noting “We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification.” Critics <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1367959802547175441?s=20">point out</a> that the notice commences the process of corporate America moving beyond the events of January 6.</p>
<p><strong>• FREE MONEY FOR LOBBYING GROUPS: </strong>Months after Congress blocked big corporate lobbying groups from obtaining coronavirus funds through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the Biden administration <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewperezdc/status/1369065049353027586">quietly gutted the ban</a>. The COVID-19 aid bill Congress passed in December barred trade associations that spend more than $1 million on lobbying activities from getting PPP loans, which are forgivable and backed by taxpayers. The Biden Small Business Administration <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/PPP%20FAQs%20%283-3-21%29.pdf">decided</a> that “lobbying activities” only refers to federal lobbying, so trade groups that spend millions lobbying at the state level can now get free money from the government.</p>
<p><strong>• ANTI-LGBTQIA GROUPS STANDARDIZE HATE</strong>: Several anti-LGBTQIA organizations have launched a <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/03/anti-lgbtq-orgs-drafting-anti-trans-bills-policymakers/?utm_source=The+19th&utm_campaign=835fa4db60-19th-newsletters-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a35c3279be-835fa4db60-365134844">website</a> to provide model language for lawmakers looking to craft anti-trans legislation. The new site purports to allow lawmakers to fill out a form that will meet all their hate bill-crafting needs.</p>
