<p>STI, or Subaru Tecnica International, is a performance division of Subaru that first began in 1988. STI engineers have extensively researched and applied what they've learned about motorsports to develop the <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/subaru?promo=SUBARU6">best-performing vehicles</a>, and you can trust the performance as they have spent thousands of hours on the track, navigating challenging roads, and inside the STI garage. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/subaru?promo=SUBARU6">This incredibly rare Subaru</a> is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter Subaru Boxer engine that generates 18 lbs. of maximum boost and produces 341-horsepower. Considered to be the most amazing street-legal Subaru ever produced, the S209 was completely designed from the chassis out to harness and balance the healthy amount of power. Given a redline of 7,200-rpm, this car was built to perform and can sprint from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just over 4 seconds. This is the first time this level of performance in a Subaru car is offered in the United States.</p>
<p>Developed with motorsports in mind, STI engineers extensively tuned the suspension to ensure insane handling on track along with insane grip when diving into those apexes and corners. </p>
<p>Nearly 2-inches wider than a WRX STI NÃ¼rburgring Challenge racecar, the body now allows for fitment of the forged alloy BBS wheels (19x9) wrapped with Dunlop 265mm rubber, the widest tires ever fitted to a Subaru STI from the factory. With that much rubber to work with, this car grips harder than any other Subaru model ever produced as it allows for 1.0-g of lateral acceleration on the skidpad. Stopping is always necessary so a Brembo performance braking system was added including silver-finished 6-piston calipers up front with two-piston monoblock calipers out back along with large cross-drilled rotors and sport brake pads.</p>
<p>Once strapped into those Recaros, you'll be more than ready to hit the track. Even better, the driver's seat can be electronically adjusted eight ways. Sitting in front of the driver is an Ultrasuede-wrapped steering wheel with plenty of grip for confident control, and a Multi-Function Display allows for easy monitoring of all vital signs. Exclusive to the S-Series are the silver and red accents that can be found throughout cabin. The front headrests are adorned with S209 badges, and the plate behind the shifter proudly displays the car's limited-production number (#153).</p>
