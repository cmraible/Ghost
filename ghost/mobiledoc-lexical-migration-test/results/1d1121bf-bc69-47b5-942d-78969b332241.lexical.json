This discovery really has people talking as so many in the UK and around the world have positive feelings towards Defenders, vehicles which are known for being able to get through just about any terrain. To see one covered in dust not from blasting down a trail but just from sitting for years on end is almost heartbreaking.",

It’s a question which goes way beyond automotive enthusiasm and crosses well into psychological territory. The best we can manage to explain is that some people have trouble letting go and it can be for a variety of complicated reasons. That might manifest itself in keeping vehicles in a barn, or a field, or wherever and refusing to sell them even as they’re going to seed, insisting you’re going to fix them up soon.",
