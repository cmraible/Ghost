<p>The man who stole a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/millionaire-parts-with-vast-bentley/">Bentley</a> Flying Spur from a business in Southfield, Michigan was caught recently, the luxury car returned in one piece to its owner. Too often we hear of these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rare-1954-bentley-stolen/">high-value vehicle thefts</a> and the end result is the car is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/canadian-international-car-theft/">shipped out of the country rapidly</a> or ends up <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-high-end-chop-shop/">chopped into pieces</a> to be sold. That’s why it’s so nice to hear about a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/vintage-harley-mysteriously/">happy ending</a> for this kind of crime, which hopefully will help act as a deterrent for those who might consider boosting cars.</p>

<p>It all started on March 22 when the Bentley Flying Spur, which is valued at $216,000, went missing from Dream Luxury Car Rentals in Southfield. Before the vehicle went missing, a man entered the business to ask about buying it but was told the Bentley wasn’t for sale. Some time after leaving, the man was captured on surveillance cameras sneaking back into the office and taking the luxury car’s keys.</p>

<p>The next day the Bentley Flying Spur just disappeared. That’s when police were called and the surveillance footage was reviewed, which included a clear image of the alleged thief. The owner of the business offered a $3,000 reward for whomever provided information leading to the car’s recovery and tips flooded in.</p>
<p>One tip checked out when the Bentley was located at a Southfield apartment complex. Siting among economy vehicles, the luxury car stuck out like a sore thumb. Police waited for the thief to come out of his apartment and get in the stolen vehicle, but instead he tried to run and was tackled to the ground. That’s when officers found the Bentley key in his pocket, tying him to the theft.</p>
<p>According to the owner of Dream Luxury Car Rentals, the Bentley Flying Spur was in good condition, “besides smelling (like) weed.” As Shakespeare said, all’s well that ends well.</p>
