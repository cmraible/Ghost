The test is performed at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds, which are located at Space Florida’s Launch and Landing Facility that’s at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Most of you are at least somewhat familiar with the facility."

Since the package isn’t horribly expensive and it comes with features some might argue should be standard on any Stingray, quite a few enthusiasts add it to their car."
