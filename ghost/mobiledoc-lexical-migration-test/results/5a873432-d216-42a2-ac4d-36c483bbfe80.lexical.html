<hr>
<p>A lot of people didn’t snatch a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</a> during its short, limited production run, so if you’re one of them you’re definitely not alone. In the collector market, Demons already <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/speedkore-dodge-demon/">command a price premium</a> and that probably will never change, especially since <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">building a clone isn’t possible</a>. Many have just decided to settle for a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-plymouth/">Hellcat</a>, but we have something better for you: a modified 2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat Widebody pushing way more power than any Demon.</p>
<p>That might sound crazy, because the Dodge Demon throttles out a thunderous 808-horsepower, making any Hellcat <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellephant-swapped-demon-quarter-mile/">seem a little weak</a>. Sure, a Hellcat is still pushing serious power, but as we all know <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">more power is always bette</a>r.</p>

<p>And that’s where this 2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat Widebody comes in. First off, people are going to ding the car for having four doors. A lot of people hate on the Charger for that sole reason. However, it not only makes the car more practical, you could argue it adds a little bit of a sleeper vibe to it since it’s not taken as seriously, even in Hellcat Widebody form.</p>
<p>What your average person won’t know is this car has been modified by Forza Tuning & Performance. It now has a ported and polished supercharger, upgraded fuel system, and a retuned 8-speed automatic transmission. That means a peak 1,000-hp, completely eclipsing the Demon’s insane horsepower figure.</p>
<p>There are some tasteful cosmetic changes on this car, all installed by APR Racing. A custom carbon-fiber front splitter, flat black stripes with orange pinstriping, and lowering springs are all included. A carbon-fiber rear wing and diffuser are going to be installed.</p>
<p>Some nice factory options are also installed on the car, including the Sidewinder wheels. Showing through are orange Brembo brake calipers, matching the orange Hellcat logo on the front fenders.</p>
<p>With all that power, can people take this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> (and some will be triggered it’s even called that) seriously? They’ll have to when you gap them, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this 1000-hp 2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat Widebody?</p>
