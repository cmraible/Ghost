One could say the Stingray was beached, its nose protruding into the air as if it were trying to break free of its earthen prison. Fortunately, nobody was hurt in the crash, unless you want to count the driver’s ego, which was thoroughly wrecked."

From them we can see serious damage to the front fascia. There could definitely be some serious chassis damage, but at least the mid-engine configuration likely protected most if not all of the powertrain."
