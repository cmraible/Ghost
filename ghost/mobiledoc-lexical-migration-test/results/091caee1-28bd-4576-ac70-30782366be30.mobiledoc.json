It seems that just about all blacked-out, menacing sports cars get some sort of Darth Vader reference these days, but we're guessing if Lord Vader really drove a car, a 645-horsepower Viper with a massive chin spoiler and rear wing would probably be his best choice."

In recent years, just about all of Chrysler's divisions have received some sort of offering powered by the Hellcat engine. These include the Challenger and Charger, which seem to get new Hellcat variations every year, as well as the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. A rumored Dodge Durango Hellcat will be introduced later this year as will a Hellcat-powered pickup truck with the Ram Rebel TRX."
