          "), the Z06 positions itself nipping on supercar territory at a price some have criticized as being ‘too low’ for what it brings to the table. There’s also been some interesting patterns in how well the Z’s hold their value - the C5 and C6 seem to punch down the C7Z with their ability to maintain an honorable price point. With the C8 already being dubbed a highly-collectable car, the C8Z might be the best new sports car investments to watch out for, but you’ll have to wait until 2022 to grab one. Regardless, the Z06 has always been and will always be one of the best sports cars on the market."
