<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.broadarrowauctions.com/vehicles/jc22_062/1930-duesenberg-model-j-willoughby-limousine">The Duesenberg J</a> was introduced at the 1928 New York Auto Show in a bare chassis form. It was developed with advanced technology, notably including a massive 420 cubic-inch twin overhead cam, 32 valve engine that was rated at an incurable 335 lbs-ft of torque - an accomplishment not seen in many performance cars until the mid 1990s. The suspension the car rolled on was remarkably refined, although somewhat conventional, and the car was uncompromising in design and execution.</p>
