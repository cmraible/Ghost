You can hear the complete story in the included video, which we strongly encourage you to check out, because it’s really something. Let’s just say if you were to find a car like this, it’s a one in a million, golden opportunity."

The interior does have saddle bucket seats, which is a nice feature, but that’s not enough to get overly excited. The fact this is a numbers-matching car is a huge plus; but wait, there’s more."

          ", this thing has the LS6 under the hood. From the LS6 Registry we learn this vehicle came from the Atlanta, Georgia assembly plant. Only 47 other cars from that plant had the LS6, which is amazing. Even more incredible, according to the registry, this is the earliest documented LS6 car to surface in recent history from Atlanta. Earlier examples might be out there, or they might have been crushed long ago."

A revised design looks more sculpted and muscular, plus the LS6 V8 made the car absolutely legendary. To see one has survived after being parked uncovered for 35 years is enough to warm our hearts, especially since it still runs."
