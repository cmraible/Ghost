That’s the highest percentage Edmunds has ever recorded for the $1,000-plus a month segment of the market. Helping drive that figure up is the fact the average annual percentage rate for new vehicles jumped to 5%, a number we haven’t seen since Q1 of 2020."

Before you think that contradicts the data from Edmunds, this figure is for the total sales price, not the amount financed. Believe it or not, that falls short of the record which was set back in December of last year. If the current situation with shortages continues, that number could be superseded by the end of 2022."

As interest rates continue to increase even more will decided to keep their hooptie going instead of getting something new. But there’s plenty of debate if things in the market will even out anytime soon or if this is “the new normal.”"
