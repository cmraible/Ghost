What’s more shocking is that thieves are raiding car factories to steal vehicles, like how thieves stole 4 new Shelby GT500s from Flat Rock Assembly Plant late a night on December 12. Police believe the suspects used one of the muscle cars to crash through a gate so they could get out of the factory complex."

One of those vehicles have heavy front-end damage, like it had crashed through a gate. We’re guessing the damage made the car undrivable after a while. Why the other Shelby was ditched wasn’t even hinted at by local law enforcement."

Police haven’t provided any other info, like interior color, so everyone just stay alert about any really cheap Shelby GT500s listed for sale on Craigslist because they’re probably stolen. Also, the Flat Rock Police Department would really appreciate you calling them if you know anything about this heist. Ford probably also wants its cars back."
