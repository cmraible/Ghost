          " is an iconic brand in western culture because of its luxury, performance, and style, which appeals heavily to automotive enthusiasts. The 1970s were an exciting time for the German automaker as cars across the world were getting better and better in terms of performance and engineering. While the power outputs may not have been incredible, nor does the build quality stand up to modern standards, these cars were still the legends of their time. That makes automobiles from this time relics of a generation whose ideas and knowledge eventually led to the insane performance cars we all know and love today.

Inside the car sits two brown leather seats and what appears to be an all-original driver-focused gauge cluster and dash. All of that intense interior design is shown off by the convertible top, which allows you to feel the calm wind in your hair as you power through straights and corners alike. That brings us to an even more exciting aspect of this car, performance. This is very important for the German automotive giant, so how does this thing hold up to the standard of '70s Mercedes?"

That remarkable powertrain adds up to a top speed of around 140 mph, or at least that's what the speedometer says.
