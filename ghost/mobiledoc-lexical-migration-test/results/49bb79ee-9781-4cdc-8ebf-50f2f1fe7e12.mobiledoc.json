          ", which makes most other cars on the road appear lifeless compared. If that mouthful of a name confuses you, just know that this car is a transition between Series One and Series two. Along with some of the classic styling cues of the Series one, the vehicle also boasted many performance features that set it apart from the competition. These include independent front and rear suspension, four-wheel-disc brakes, and a rack & pinion steering setup. These features came together to create an insane opponent on any road racing track. However, the main attraction has got to be the engine, so what does this vintage Jaguar have under the hood?"

          " and nimble beast is a 4.2-liter inline-six which would be considered a big motor for a six-cylinder today. Back in the day, this engine put out 265 horsepower translating to a 0-60 mph time of just 6.7 seconds. With rapid acceleration, you also get a mighty top speed of 150 mph, more than enough to defeat any car from the same era. That's what made this car such a fantastic performance option in its day and the reason it stands tall as one of Britain's most valuable collector cars. If you're an enthusiast with a taste for fast classic cars, this vehicle will suit you well. The only question now is, what are you waiting for?"
