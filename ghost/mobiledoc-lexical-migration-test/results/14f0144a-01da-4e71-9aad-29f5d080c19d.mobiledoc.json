          " is a puzzle platformer that was originally released back in 2012, with this being the first time it has been released on a Nintendo system. Explore a 2D world with a new perspective - in 3D! With your magical fez hat on, you are now tasked with saving the universe. Widely praised for its unique gameplay back when it was initially released, the question to ask in 2021 is whether it truly holds up after nine years of modern darling indie games."

This 2D puzzle platformer contains some unique mechanics as previously mentioned, which results in various clever puzzle elements such as turning panels to continue an explosion around a tower or altering the location of platforms which allows you to scale higher up them. While this is a neat mechanic, it can lead to some frustrating moments when you can see how to keep moving forward but you can’t quite do so in the right order. "

I died many times this way, especially when I was attempting to reach lower points and could not find a way to hang onto the edge in order to get lower afterwards. While the platforming is mostly fluent, this is such a difficult manoeuvre to pull off, making it consistently frustrating to deal with."

The small cubes tend to float around levels and are easier to collect while the large ones tend to be situated at the end of a stretch of levels or in a puzzle room. While this provides a solid form of progression, they can sometimes feel arbitrarily or even few and far between each other."

Your task is to collect cubes in order to restore the universe to its rightful state and save everything from collapsing into itself. The remainder of the story requires more effort from the player, such as using a cipher to read a cryptic language and exploring the bizarrely cubed world in its entirety."
