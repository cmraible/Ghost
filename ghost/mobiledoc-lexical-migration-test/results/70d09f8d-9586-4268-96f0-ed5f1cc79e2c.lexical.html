<p>On <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-classic-suv-showdown/">three separate occasions</a>, we've pitted <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-class-69/">Detroit's Big Three</a> against each other in various iterations of Own/Drive/Crush. Most recently was last week's battle of the tailfins – the "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-class-of-57/">Class of '57</a>."</p>
<p>This week, we're going to look at three different versions of the same car. We've tracked down a trio of Ford Mustang convertibles that can be had for under $25,000. Which one would we add to our garage, and which would we send to the scrapheap?</p>

<p>First up is <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213869/1988-ford-mustang-gt-convertible">this 1988 Ford Mustang GT convertible</a>. Fox-body Mustangs – especially the fuel injected, aero-look '87 to '93 cars. The going rate for this one is $19,900, despite having 83,986 miles.</p>
<p>We fondly recall when these cars could be had for well under five grand – but that was when many of us were still getting up early for Saturday morning cartoons. This is the new reality of Fox values.</p>

<p>To be fair, though, this is a particularly handsome example, in an attractive red over white combo. The manual transmission is a nice bonus.</p>

<p>Next up, we've got <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/213873/1971-ford-mustang-convertible">this 1971 Mustang convertible</a> for $23,900. Were it not for the Mustang II that followed, the '71 to '73 Mustangs may very well be the least popular <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">classic Mustangs</a> with collectors (with a few notable exceptions – '71 Mach 1, anyone?).</p>

<p>They weren't slim and svelte like the cars that came before, and they were certainly much larger than those that came immediately after. Still, these are handsome <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/blame-un-modern-cars/">looking cars</a>, especially this black on black example with Magnum 500 wheels and a Mach 1-style chin spoiler.</p>
<p>This one is powered by a 351 Cleveland backed up by a C4 automatic. It looks to be in decent shape, but could benefit from some bodywork, a new top, and some freshening up in the interior. Overall, though, it's a great-looking car that should have many rethinking their point of view on '71-'73 Mustangs. </p>

<p>Finally, we located <a href="https://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/dealer/ford/mustang/2439439.html">this 2013 Mustang convertible</a> in Gotta Have It Green. It's one of our favorite recent Mustang colors and, to us, is one of the best things about this particular car.</p>
<p>It's also price well at $19,000 with just 51,000 miles. Unfortunately, the combination of a V6 and an automatic make this one quite a lot less fun to drive than the other two, even if it's just as fast or faster.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/stangvert5-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/stangvert5-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/stangvert5-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/11/stangvert5-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px">

<p>That's why we place this one firmly in the "crush" category. That V8 sound is a big part of the Mustang experience, especially with the top down. A normally aspirated V6 will simply never be as good, although we wouldn't mind an EcoBoost.</p>
<p>That leaves the '88 and the '72, and it's a hard choice. Initially, we wanted to pick the '72, but it might need more work than we'd like, so we placed it in the "Drive" category. A careful inspection – especially underneath – might convince us to rethink our decision.</p>
<p>Based on the info we have, though, we'd pick the '88 GT as our favorite of these three. Given the condition, it's a no-brainer. We'd treat this one well, using it only occasionally as it quietly appreciates in value. A good Fox is hard to find. If you manage to track one down, hold on tight.</p>
