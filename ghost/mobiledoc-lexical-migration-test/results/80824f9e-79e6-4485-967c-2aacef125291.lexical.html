<p>Nostalgia is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/nostalgia-fuels-car-hobby/">powerful force</a>, both within the automotive industry and without, so it’s understandable why people are constantly looking for ways to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2006-ford-gt-heritage-edition/">mix the old and new</a>. That’s the driving force behind a restomod, for example, since it provides the timeless design <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-adds-three-classic-racing-liveries-to-taycan-ev/">sensibilities of a classic car</a> with the technologies and conveniences of a modern vehicle. While usually the nostalgia flows in that direction, updating something old with newer features, sometimes it goes the other way and the results can be quite interesting as you can see in the video showcasing modern Formula One <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-lotus-elise/">liveries</a> adorning classic cars.</p>
<blockquote><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-adds-three-classic-racing-liveries-to-taycan-ev/"><em>Check out</em></a><em> these modern Porsches with racing livery.</em></blockquote>
<p>For racing fans, particularly those who watch F1 with any level of intensity, these liveries are quite familiar. You can imagine how it feels to see the modern design applied to a cars from a few decades ago. We’re used to seeing classic liveries applied to modern road cars, like when Ford released the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2006-ford-gt-heritage-edition/">Heritage Edition for the GT</a>, but turning that around is in some ways even more interesting.</p>

<p>Usually, people would be nervous about making such modifications to timeless classic cars such as these. That, and the cars are rare to come by, so the only sensible thing is to use a virtual format to experiment with the aesthetics. While some people would automatically run to Photoshop and start flexing their digital painting skills, these guys had a less-conventional idea.</p>
<p>As you’ll see in the video, they turned on their PlayStation and fired up Gran Turismo. In the game, er driving simulator, you can apply custom liveries to cars, which you might have done before. But did you think to apply modern F1 liveries to classic cars? Well, you don’t have to since these guys already did it. So sit back and enjoy the show.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_-SSD1WnKc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
