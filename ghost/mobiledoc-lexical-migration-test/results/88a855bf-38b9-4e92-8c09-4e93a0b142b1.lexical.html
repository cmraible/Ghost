<p>Good things are happening! The federal courts delivered surprisingly good rulings in major climate cases, including nullifying the largest ever offshore oil and gas drilling lease sale. New York City, meanwhile, is making moves towards powering its public housing with renewable energy. And financial regulators are stepping up scrutiny of skyrocketing CEO pay.</p>

<p><strong>COURTS DELIVER BAD NEWS FOR THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY: </strong><em>We’ve become so used to the Republican-packed federal courts striking down good climate policies it came as a surprise this week when the federal courts struck down major fossil fuel projects. On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/court-deals-major-blow-to-mountain-valley-pipeline/"><em>rejected reviews</em></a> from the ​​Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to allow the Mountain Valley pipeline, a 300-mile natural gas pipeline, to cut through the Jefferson National Forest. (The Indigenous Environmental Network <a href="https://twitter.com/IENearth/status/1486080198411964418?s=20&t=D8PluiUb2j3JJAfCvFVVLg"><em>wants you to demand the White House</em></a> deny water permits for the project.)</em></p>
<p><em>Then, on Thursday, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/court-revokes-largest-ever-u-s-offshore-oil-lease-cites-nepa/"><em>blocked</em></a> the Biden administration’s oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest in American history. The administration’s lawyers had concluded that the climate crisis did <a href="__GHOST_URL__/does-not-present-sufficient-cause/"><em>“not present sufficient cause”</em></a> to justify conducting a new environmental review of the sale. However, environmental groups led by Earthjustice argued that “environmental analysis behind the lease sale [was] based on outdated and arbitrary science,” as </em>The Daily Poster<em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/does-not-present-sufficient-cause/"><em>previously reported</em></a>, and called the sale a “huge climate bomb” — an opinion apparently shared by the federal court.</em></p>

<p><strong>PAY RAISES FOR FEDERAL WORKERS, CONTRACTORS: </strong><em>Last spring, Biden’s Department of Labor finalized a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20211122"><em>rule</em></a> to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour. The rule goes into effect next week, and will grant raises for <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/up-to-390000-federal-contractors-will-get-a-raise-starting-next-week/"><em>up to 390,000</em></a> workers. Biden signed a separate order last spring to raise the minimum wage for federal civilian employees to $15 an hour that <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/management/pay-benefits/2022/01/21/office-of-personnel-management-directs-15-minimum-wage-for-federal-workers/"><em>will impact 67,000</em></a> additional workers, which will also take effect next week.</em></p>
<p><strong>FINANCIAL REGULATORS TAKE ACTION: </strong><em>Biden’s slate of aggressive financial regulators continue to make moves that will actually help people. The Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.pionline.com/regulation/sec-proposes-expansion-private-fund-reporting-requirements"><em>proposed new rules</em></a> to expand disclosure requirements for hedge funds and private equity firms, which will make it easier for regulators to conduct oversight of the growing role of private funds in the financial system. The agency also proposed a new rule to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-proposes-asking-companies-say-why-ceo-pay-performance-often-dont-match-up-2022-01-27/"><em>increase scrutiny of CEO pay</em></a>, which is skyrocketing and outpacing company performance.</em></p>
<p><strong>NINA TURNER STRIKES BACK: </strong><em>Former Ohio state senator and Bernie Sanders surrogate Nina Turner has announced that she is once again <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/591398-nina-turner-launches-new-campaign-for-congress-setting-up-likely-rematch"><em>running for Congress</em></a>, which will likely mean another primary against corporate Democrats’ preferred choice, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-business-is-coming-out-against-nina-turner/"><em>Rep. Shontel Brown</em></a>. (You can donate to Turner’s campaign <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/snt-website?refcode=website-nav&utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Launch_Day"><em>here</em></a>). Meanwhile, the Matriarch Movement, a group working to elect progressive working-class women, is recruiting people to run for office — especially local office — and wants you to <a href="https://www.matriarchtraining.com/"><em>sign up</em></a> for an upcoming training.</em></p>
