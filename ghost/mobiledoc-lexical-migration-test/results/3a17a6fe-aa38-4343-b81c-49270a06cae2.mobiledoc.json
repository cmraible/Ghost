          ". Finished in bright and glossy Monaco Orange, this C3 Corvette is in flawless condition. Back in 2003, this classic was given a professional frame-off restoration, and it still appears as if it just left the factory assembly line. Considering that was about 16 years ago, it is obvious that this vintage gem has been meticulously maintained. Only a mere 3,517 miles have accumulated since its completion."

          "Under the hood of this beautiful classic sits the original and recently rebuilt 327cui V8 engine capable of a healthy 350-horsepower. It has been equipped with Dart II heads, a slightly higher hydraulic camshaft, and an Edelbrock dual quad high-rise chrome intake manifold. Even more, it fires right up thanks to an MSD ignition system and wires along with an HEI distributor and coil. A complete serpentine pulley system was also installed, and keeping the temperature in check is the addition of a B Cool radiator with electric fans. Added performance and rumble comes from powder-coated Hooker headers. The M21 transmission was rebuilt in 2018 and installed in the car with a new clutch. Torque is transferred to the 3.55 positraction rear axle and on to the rear wheels."

Even more, this car also has the convenience of power windows."
