For the glamour shots, though, they do usually build one or two cars to lock in that connection from the car community. Those cars are sometimes kept by people that work on the films or shown at car shows but sometimes they are sold off. That’s when people like Shawn Davis’ friend Jamie get the opportunity to own a jaw dropping stunt double like this 1970 Plymouth "

To control all that power, Jamie implemented a Wilwood hydroboost 6-piston brake system.  On the dyno, this equates to 763-horsepower and 800 lbs-ft of torque, without boost or power adders of any kind. Forgeline’s three-piece titanium finish wheels fill the wheel wells and match the design of the car nicely. Reilly Motorsports built the suspension for the car and though it is a very track worthy setup, it really handles the road well."
