<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-vipers-on-motorious/">Viper</a> Blue paint job with white stripes makes a strong statement everyone will stop and notice. Elevating this classic further are the straight ad clean body panels, OE badges, and brightwork in good repair. The 18-inch and 20-inch Billet Specialties wheels provide the proper kind of stance for the Camaro RS. This is the kind of car you can pull up in at any parking lot and draw stares, if not a crowd.</p>

<p>This machine will also impress with excellent performance. According to the seller, the V8 engine has been pushed to producing 450-horsepower, thanks in part to the Edelbrock Performer RPM aluminum heads, Victor JR intake, and 750 cfm Quik Fuel carb. There’s also an MSD ignition. Rounding out the drivetrain is a Turbo 350 automatic transmission and a 12-bolt Positraction rear end. To help handle all that extra power, the Camaro RS also has 11-inch disc brakes, subframe connectors, plus quick ratio power steering.</p>
<p>Much of the interior is stock, with some nice restoration work to fix what was no doubt worn out. White seats contrast with the black carpeting and dash, making for a nice two-tone effect. The factory air conditioning and heater both work. A large aftermarket tachometer has been added, plus more auxiliary gauges ahead of the gear selector on the transmission tunnel.</p>
<p>Chevrolet surprised everyone by debuting a fresh design for the Camaro in 1969, a year ahead of schedule. The muscular body was a huge success and is something collectors today will pay dearly to own. That alone makes this Camaro RS desirable, while the modifications only add to the fun of owning the car. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Old+Toen+Automobiles">Old Town Automobiles</a> has brought this excellent muscle car to market so it can find a new, loving home.</p>
