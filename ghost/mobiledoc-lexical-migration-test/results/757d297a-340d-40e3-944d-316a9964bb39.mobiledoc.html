<p>After finishing up at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/miami-hack-week-ramp-house/">Ramp House</a>, I called up an Uber to make my way over to Miami Beach where the Showtime x <a href="https://www.blackdove.com">Blackdove</a> House was located. I walked up the stairs to the house excited to see what was being dreamed up inside. As I opened the door and entered the house the first thing I noticed was a giant aquarium in the foyer. Directly past that were a few folding tables with some people wired in and hacking away.</p>
<p>"Ahhh, this is amazing," I thought to myself. I felt like I was in Silicon Valley but I wasn't, I was still in Miami. The vibes were impeccable. People gathering together to build and iterate on ideas, it's exactly what the Miami Tech ecosystem needs to continue pushing forward. As Miami Hack Week organizer, Dave Fontenot has <a href="https://racket.com/jsw/ryR4e">said to me</a> and others, we need to enlighten engineers as to what's so special about Miami Tech. And what better way to do that than by bringing them here and giving them a taste of what we have to offer? I dig it!</p>

<p>I made my way through the house until I got to the backyard where I found one of the house's main sponsors, Richard Grundy. He was seated out back under a tiki hut on his laptop. "Make yourself at home," Richard said to me as we both took in the gorgeous ocean view directly in front of us. The house had a dock out back too, some of the hackers had been out on a boat trip and were just arriving back, just in time for lunch: Chipotle. Â </p>

<p>Heading back inside I decided to sit down at one of the folding tables in the living room, which is where I met Simon. He started talking to me about what he and his team were hacking on, "We're building a TikTiok deepfake app," he said and of course I was instantly intrigued. "Who would you be deepfaking?" I asked, at which point, Simon explained, "It would be for the TikToker's own account." </p>
<p>Hmm. ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>"So you can go out and do whatever you want while 'deepfake you' engages with your audience," Simon went on to tell me. In short, what he and his team built was a way to scale yourself up. Genius! </p>

<p>I was able to check in with the team at the expo later in the week. They built a working prototype and placed within the top 10 teams. When the team did a brief presentation at the expo, they demo'd how it worked: the computer vision would be able to read questions in the TikTok live chat and then the deepfake would respond. It worked. And no one was any the wiser. In fact, when the team got it working, they went live on TikTok and let the deepfake tech do its thing while they went out drinking. Gotta love it.</p>
<p>This kind of technology has really big implications. One it's dope (though deepfakes also have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/594qx5/there-is-no-tech-solution-to-deepfakes">potential privacy concerns</a>) and two, it has the potential to be game changing for many independent creators, of which, I am one. I'm excited to see how this progresses. </p>
<h3 id="hack-project-onlyfung">Hack Project: OnlyFung </h3>
<p>As I made my way around the house I noticed there were a few big whiteboards standing upright throughout the living room area, some with bits of code, some with outlines, some with notes â€“ one note in particular caught my eye: OnlyFung. </p>
<p>It wasn't until after lunch that I caught up with the team members on the OnlyFung team. </p>
<p>"Think of it like an NFT version of Instagram," Varun, one of the team members, said to me to kickoff our conversation. "Right now, we can send data to the chain and retrieve it" he told me, with respect to the progress the team had made so far. While he spoke with me he was waiting for the rest of his team, Abin, Derek, and Esteban, to arrive at the Showtime x Blackdove hack house to keep hacking along. Â </p>

<p>While we waited for his team to arrive, I learned more about how the OnlyFung team was thinking about the project. They wanted to give people a way to share content in a decentralized way while also incentivizing people to share. Listening to Varun talk, I proposed an idea: what if you could leverage the blockchain to make sure photographers receive appropriate attribution and monetization of their photos?</p>
<p>He agreed. Clearly he and the team had their work cut out for them. It wasn't too long after, that his team showed up and off to work they went.</p>
<p>"Happy hacking!" I said as we wrapped up our conversation. </p>
<p>When I found the OnlyFung team at the expo, I checked in with them on their progress. From Tuesday to Friday, the team had gotten the web app built, which featured a way to upload, like, and comment on photos. It definitely came quite a way from when we spoke on Tuesday. </p>
