<p>Gleaming in a glossy black finish, <a href="https://restomods.com/for-sale/sweepstakes/order10?utm_source=dpmotor&utm_medium=yah">this custom '71 Chevelle</a> was given an exceptional frame-off restoration and packed with modern components.

<p><a href="https://restomods.com/for-sale/sweepstakes/order10?utm_source=dpmotor&utm_medium=yah">This Chevelle restomod</a> is as powerful as it is beautiful. The heart of the beast is a modern fuel-injected LS1 V8 engine from Chevrolet Performance topped with an LSA supercharger. A T56 six-speed manual transmission shifts power through an LS7 clutch and down to the 12-bolt Detroit Truetrac posi rear end with 4.11 gears. Approximately 66,000 miles were accumulated on the LS1 motor before installation. Mechanical highlights include a new Nick Williams throttle body, black Holley valve covers, Edelbrock headers, a custom radiator, and a custom 3-gallon coolant reservoir to keep everything running cool. The car also features an LSX Concepts race drive front accessory drive that was powder-coated black to match the engine bay. Quenching the thirst of the car is a new Walbro 455 fuel pump with new fuel lines, a Ricks stainless gas tank, and a new fuel pressure regulator. This combination that generates a pavement-stomping 581-horsepower after being tuned by JBA Speed Shop in San Diego and put on the dyno. </p>

<p>Harnessing that power and planting it to the ground is the modern suspension system with upgraded sway bars, tubular front control arms, Belltech 2-inch drop spindles, and QA1 components such as adjustable rear upper bars, coil-overs on all four corners, and no-hop bars. Equipped with power steering, the car was given upgraded steering linkage with Borgeson components.</p>
