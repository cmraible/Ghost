<p>Those naughty folks at <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/IT-downtime-blog/2008/03/comments-we-love-them-what-do.html"><em>Computer Weekly</em>‘s Downtime blog</a> are taking the mickey out of <a href="http://engagement101.blogspot.com/2008/03/ribbed-for-their-pleasure.html">one of my colleagues</a> with this video:</p>

<p>Now, I reckon that that they’re missing the point and Mr Rogers will have the last larf here. The video isn’t mocking user generated content in general, just that slightly cheesy way TV and radio solicits user feedback to give them a thin patina of interaction, which is wholly fake. Compare the “reckons” on TV to the debates found in blog comments or forums, and you’ll see how shallow these efforts really are.</p>
<p>I hereby coin the phrase “cargo-cult engagement” to describe this phenomenon. My licensing rates are very reasonable…</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
