Pop artist Peter Max of New York City purchased the whole lot and supposedly had plans to use them in some interesting art installation piece. However, the man seemingly did nothing with the cars, and so they sat uncared for all the way until recently. A group of enthusiasts purchased the Corvettes and had them restored, then started a giveaway campaign so they would go to loving homes while also raising money for Stand for the Troops. So far, 28 Corvettes have been given away, including this ’84.",
