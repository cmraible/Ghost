<hr>
<p>While the 2023 McLaren Artura is technologically advanced, it’s already been recalled for a rather low-tech potential problem. Apparently, some loose nuts could lead to a fuel leak, and as anyone who knows anything about thermodynamics, that in turn could lead to a rolling bonfire. This obviously is a serious issue anyone who has an Artura should not ignore.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a Shelby GT500 race a McLaren 720 S <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/shelby-wipes-the-floor-with-mclaren/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This news comes after it was revealed McLaren has been selling off portions of its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mclaren-sells-classic-car-collection/">corporate classic car collection</a> to fund the costs associated with the new Artura. The reason for this dramatic move is the British automaker is still in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mclaren-financial-trouble/">dire financial shape</a>. Some have pointed out McLaren is one of the last high-performance brands to not offer a crossover, something which likely would be a huge financial boon. After all, Lamborghini, Porsche, and even Ferrari are cashing in on crossovers.</p>

<p>According to a Safety Recall Report issued by NHTSA, the problem is with some cold formed nuts. They potentially can loosen from the fuel pump outlet under load, especially in a track driving scenario where the vehicle is being pushed to its limits. That would not make for a great track day. Arturas assembled with fully machined nuts aren’t included in the recall.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the lucky few to already have received a McLaren Artura, you can contact the automaker to see if yours has been recalled or look up your VIN on the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls">NHTSA website</a>.</p>

<p>Just like with any recall, dealers will make the necessary repairs free of charge. McLaren is reaching out to owners of cars which were manufactured using the cold formed nuts. Hopefully there isn’t another recall for the hybrid supercar, however with how common vehicle recalls are these days it wouldn’t be surprising if there is.</p>
