<p>Friends:</p>
<p>On this week‚Äôs <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota sat down with comedian, actor, and author Russell Brand. Over the last several years, Russell has become one of the biggest ‚Äî and most polarizing ‚Äî political content creators on YouTube. David and Russell get into the nitty-gritty about Russell‚Äôs political evolution, as well as the criticisms he‚Äôs received. It‚Äôs a fascinating conversation and we‚Äôre excited to share it with <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs audience. <em>The Audit</em> continues its hiatus, so make sure to catch up on their first two mini-seasons.</p>

<p>In the new episode of <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota is joined by comedian, actor, and author Russell Brand for a long-form conversation about Russell‚Äôs evolution from comedian to political content creator. In the last few years, Russell has built a significant online following, where his brand of anti-establishment, pro-spirituality intellectualism has garnered him more than six million subscribers on YouTube. David asks Russell about his ideological development, as well as some of the criticisms that have been levied against him, including how some of his content could be construed as ‚Äúconspiracy theories.‚Äù</p>
