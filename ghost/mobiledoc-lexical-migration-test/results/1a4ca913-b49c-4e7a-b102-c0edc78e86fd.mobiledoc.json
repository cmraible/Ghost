Considering these trucks were designed to be workhorses, this truck is still in great shape compared to how many of these trucks you see completely rusted out or worn down. Sure, there's the patina on the hood and some minor wear and tear inside the truck, but overall, it looks to be a great rig. It has power windows, power locks and cruise control, and the 454 CID V-8, automatic transmission and dual fuel tanks mean this thing can long haul just about anything you hook to it."

This time capsule of a camper has had very little use in its day as shown by the overall condition and the fact that the cushions and utensils are still in their respective bags. In addition to conveniences such as the four-burner stove and oven, sink, refrigerator, air conditioning unit and a full bathroom with a shower, this camper also has an on-board water heater. What more could you ask for?"
