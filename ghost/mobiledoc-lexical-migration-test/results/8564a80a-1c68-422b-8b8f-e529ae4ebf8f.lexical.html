<p>When not actively driving on the road, some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/younger-gearheads-restomod/">gearheads</a> like to hone their skills behind the wheel of a simulator. Sure, you could play <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/digital-dodge-charger-for-sale/">Forza on your Xbox</a> at home, or if you’re really fancy get the wheel and pedals kit to make it more realistic. For those who want a truly high end simulation experience, there’s this ultra-exclusive <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/">Pininfarina</a> Leggenda eClassic Simulator, which just so happens to be headed for the auction block this month.</p>
<blockquote><em>How much do you know about the Ferrari F40? Find out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>So far, only 9 of these have been made by the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/italdesign-ducati-860-e-concept/">Italian car design firm</a> in collaboration with The Classic Car Trust. This isn’t just any vehicle simulator, but instead was created to simulate driving a collector car. A selection of true driver’s cars as well as virtual roads and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/walt-disney-world-speedway/">tracks</a> from around the world can be enjoyed when you want to drive but not actually go anywhere.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking the simulator looks a little familiar, there’s good reason. Even though these were unveiled late last year, they draw on the design of the Cisitalia 202, a 2-seat grand tourer which Pinin Farina himself designed in the 1940s. That’s fitting since these simulators were made to commemorate 90 years since the man began his impactful career.</p>
<p>Hand made at the Pininfarina factory in Cambiano, Italy, this simulator features craftsmanship which would shame most cars. Among the fine details is a Nardi wood steering wheel, vintage Hanhart chronometer, Marrone Tobacco-shade Connolly leather upholstery, three pedals, and manual gear selector. Users view the tracks and road courses through a curved screen to simulate a windshield, making the simulator more immersive.</p>

<p>As if the simulator itself isn’t interesting enough, access to The eClassic Club and membership for the eClassic Member App for 3 years is included with the sale. That provides people with access to a community of collector car enthusiasts, training sessions, eAcademy coaching, races, and informal group drives.</p>
<p>This Pininfarina Leggenda eClassic Simulator crosses the block at the RM Sotheby’s St. Moritz event in Switzerland on September 17.</p>
