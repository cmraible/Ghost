However, Nintendo just announced that they currently have no plans to bring this bundle outside of Japan.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame considering many families already have a Switch dock plugged into their TV and they would just like a second device for another family member. But who knows, perhaps the bundle will prove to be very successful and they&#8217;ll reconsider?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what do you think about this new piece of information?
