Now residing in Texas, there is no doubt that these are extremely desirable vehicles, however, this is mostly in large part because they were once owned by Walker himself. While the same is true for this BMW M1, there is much more to be hailed here than just 'celebrity status.' The rarity of this specific modified model, combined with high horsepower number, great wheels, and customized body kit/paint makes this a ridiculously high-value car and a great buy for anyone from collectors to enthusiasts."
