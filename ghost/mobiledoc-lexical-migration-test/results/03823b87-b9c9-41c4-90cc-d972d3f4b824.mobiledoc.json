          "Early on the morning of January 13, three men showed up at Mathews Dodge with the intention of leaving with a Dodge Challenger Hellcat and Charger Hellcat sitting in the showroom. Instead of paying for the cars, the men stole them, something we see way too often these days. That kind of a heist in the city of Mount Vernon, Ohio is a big deal since it’s not exactly Chicago or Detroit. It also shows this problem of professional car theft rings is spreading to rural America."

Instead, we just know that the three suspects pulled up in a “silver SUV.” That’s right, no make, model, etc. We’d at least be curious if that SUV was a Mopar, because we’ve seen thieves stealing Dodges while using other Mopars to pull it off, which were probably stolen as well."

While that might be a factor, including the resulting increase in vehicle values, there are other things likely driving this behavior as well. Lax bail policies, toned-down prosecution, and the slashing of police department budgets certainly have contributed to criminals feeling they can act with impunity."

That’s why the local sheriff’s office is studying the surveillance video and taking the investigation seriously. The last thing anyone wants is criminals deciding the area is a good place to steal more cars or commit other crimes."
