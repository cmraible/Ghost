Two, you get to show off to everyone on the street that you have the financial might to own and maintain a Range Rover.",

Some have theorized the rocker loved the unique look of the Studebaker, a thing which has attracted others to the long-gone brand. There’s very little known about how Mercury acquired the Champion or really much else about his ownership of it, but the man did pose for a famous photograph sitting on the front bumper. It should be noted that the Champion was credited for saving Studebaker back in 1950, so maybe the rocker loved that fighting spirit.",
