If they can get you feeling all warm and gushy about something cool they did back when they actually cared about consumers, they’ve won over your heart and your cash. That’s how I’m viewing these “Last Call” special edition Dodges being revealed in rapid order. The latest one, the Scat Pack Widebody Swinger Challenger and Charger, is no different."

After all, this is a tribute to the classic Dodge Swinger, complete with a “retro-themed appearance” to make you feel whatever will separate your from your hard-earned money for the next 7 years."

There’s also faux woodgrain interior trim pieces, but Dodge really dropped the ball by not including shag carpet as well. Maybe that will be a dealer option later."

I was really hoping Dodge would do some moonshots and add some crazy performance mods to the Mopar twins, sending them off in most epic fashion, but that would’ve made too much sense. Instead, this is what we get. Considering what’s coming down the pipeline next from Dodge, it’s hardly a surprise even though it’s definitely disappointing."
