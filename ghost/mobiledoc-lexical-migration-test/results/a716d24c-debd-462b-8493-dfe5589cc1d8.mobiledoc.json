That might not sound like a great plan if you’re too logical, but the romance of taking such a machine out on the open road is compelling if you just shut off the left side of your brain. He was smart and put new tires on the thing, because riding on dry rot is just asking for something very bad to happen. Since he’s the one taking the risk and not me, I’m totally okay going along for the trip."

Just about every factory in the country was churning out weapons, machinery, or other supplies for the troops. This included Harley-Davidson, which supplied the U.S. Army with over 90,000 WLAs. Nicknamed The Liberator by American troops, they were simple and rugged, designed to withstand not only traveling over rugged terrain for miles and miles but also being caught in crossfire."

Thankfully, some thought it would be better to preserve the machines which helped stem the tide of authoritarianism in the world. Many of those, like this one featured in the video, were stashed away in sheds, garages, barns, and yes even basements. They sat unridden for decades, but as a testament to their battle-hardened design, these old Harleys have withstood the ravages of time surprisingly well."

There’s a nice patina on it, the seat looks to be pretty much done, but the real question is how well will all the mechanicals run for such a journey? This is a far cry from taking a newly acquired bike for a spin around the neighborhood, which often leads to pushing it home. Check out the video to see how it all goes down."
