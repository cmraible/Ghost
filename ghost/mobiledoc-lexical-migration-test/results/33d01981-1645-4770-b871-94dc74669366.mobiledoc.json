Even better, this Shelby has never been registered before, which means the winning bidder will officially become the car's first and original owner. Since these cars were planned before Carroll's death in 2012, it's still being sold with its original MSO (manufacturer's statement of origin) that was signed by Carroll Shelby before the car was even built. This Cobra 427 S/C looks amazing with its black and orange stripes over a white paint job, and that 429 cubic-inch V8 lays down an incredible 550 horsepower and 540 lb-ft of torque."
