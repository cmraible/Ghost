<p>President Joe Biden is expanding a Medicare privatization scheme developed under President Donald Trump that is forcing hundreds of thousands of seniors onto new private Medicare plans without their knowledge.</p>
<p>As <em>The Lever </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/seniors-medicare-benefits-are-being-privatized-without-consent/">recently reported</a>, the development represents a troubling new dimension in the fight by corporate interests to privatize Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 or older. While some Medicare patients choose to sign up for private insurance plans, thanks to this new scheme, many seniors are now being enrolled in for-profit plans without their informed consent.</p>
