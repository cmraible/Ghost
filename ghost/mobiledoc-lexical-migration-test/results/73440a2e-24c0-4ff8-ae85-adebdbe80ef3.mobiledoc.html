<p>We know the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pushy-c8-corvette-driver/">C8 Corvette</a> is an impressive machine with looks to kill, which is why it’s been a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/koenigsegg-praises-c8-corvette/">hot item</a> since it first released. However, watching one almost reach 192 mph while doing some tests on the Kennedy Space Center runway is really crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a guy jump his Corvette in an attempt to sell it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-jumps-c8-corvette/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The C8 Corvette in question is a 2022 Z51 with apparently no engine modifications. That means the 6.2-liter V8 is producing 495-horesepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque – respectable figures but nothing crazy in this day and age. It’s also using the factory 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>
<p>According to the guys who did this test, this c8 weighs in at 3,534 lbs. The date of the test was February 18 and the distance the car traveled was 2.7 miles. While trying to hit 192 mph on a public highway is pure stupidity, we wonder if it would even be possible since conditions wouldn’t be quite as ideal as on this runway. Don’t try to prove us wrong on that, please.</p>

<p>This video is of course a huge flex for fans of the C8 Corvette. Believe it or not, the new generation is favored by all the Corvette faithful for a few different reasons. Add to that the fact fans of European supercars also like to dump on the C8 because after all it’s American and “only a Corvette” and you can easily see why C8 fans might have a bit of a chip on their shoulder.</p>
<p>However, time and again we see evidence the C8 Corvette is an impressive performance machine, not only in straight-line acceleration but also when it comes to handling. Sure, it’s not the best at everything, but what vehicle is? And for the price, it’s hard to get such a performance bargain. And perhaps that’s why some enthusiasts in Europe don’t like it since they seem to have a thing for unobtainable cars.</p>
