<p>On Tuesday, <em>The Hill </em>published an opinion piece by former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman in which the Democrat-turned-independent gushed over Sen. Joe Manchin’s “sensible suggestion” to stall debate on Democrats’ reconciliation package. It’s no surprise that Lieberman likes Manchin: Not only has the West Virginia Senator taken up Lieberman’s old corporate Democratic villain role, but Manchin’s attempts to sabotage his own party’s social agenda play right into the hands of Lieberman’s Wall Street masters.</p>
<p>Also, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is refusing to consider higher taxes on the wealthy corporations — after voting no on the Trump tax cuts and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/kyrsten-sinemas-tax-flip/">campaigning against them</a>.</p>
