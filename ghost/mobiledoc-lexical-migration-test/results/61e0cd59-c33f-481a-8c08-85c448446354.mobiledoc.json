Today, the body shows its age with dings, scratches and general wear, but for the most part, this seems to be a very solid and complete car. Realistically, all it seems to need is a cosmetic restoration to get become a show-winning classic. This process has already been started as the black convertible top and red carpeting are both brand new and the red seats were recently reupholstered."

Since being pulled from the barn, this Corvette has been given a new radiator, Vintage Air, new front disc brakes and new Bilstein shocks, and even without a full restoration, this beautiful 'Vette would be a strong and reliable cruiser."
