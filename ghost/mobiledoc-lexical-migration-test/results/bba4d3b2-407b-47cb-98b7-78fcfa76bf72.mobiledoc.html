<p>We know plenty of enthusiasts have been wondering what’s going on with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1965-chevy-corvair-sema/">Corvair</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/must-see-car-museuma/">Museum</a> which was announced for Hastings, Nebraska. A local report indicates the man behind it, Chris Shade of Shade’s Classic Corner Cars, says the museum is set to open in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Watch vintage Corvair handling footage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-corvair-handling-footage/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We know that means waiting about two years, but hopefully the result will be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-corvair-junkyard/">worth it</a>. According to KSNB, the museum initially is estimated to cost $5.9 million and won’t use an existing building, but instead will be a purpose-built facility. Many car museums are housed in old warehouses or retail spaces, so Shade is investing some serious resources into his passion project.</p>

<p>Through the Corvair Museum, people will be able to learn more about the history of one of the most misunderstood American cars. Shade has related how people have erroneous beliefs like that the Corvair was styled after the first year of the Camaro. The most common one we encounter still is that Corvairs are just plain unsafe, thanks to Ralph Nader’s book.</p>
<p>Also included in the museum will be a multi-purpose event center the community can use for a variety of purposes, including weddings and company parties. That might help educate the normies more instead of just attracting hardcore gearheads.</p>

<p>“Our hope is to preserve the legacy of the Corvair, keeping people’s awareness of it’s historic impact on the industry but also to have a hub for events in Hastings,” said Chris Shade, President of Corvair Museum of America. “Whether it’s a car club meeting or if we’re hosting a convention here, a Corvair convention to bring people from out of town.”</p>
<p>Another feature of the upcoming Corvair Museum will be a replica Yenko dealership with 1 of the 100 Yenko Stingers on display. 2025 can’t come soon enough.</p>
