Lots of people want to spend at least $54,595 for one instead of just $29,995 for a gas-burning Wrangler which will literally murder Earth. After all, for the second quarter of this year, 20% of all Wrangler sales were for the 4xe, making it the best-selling plug-in hybrid in the US. And as we all know, such a vehicle won’t lose sales momentum after the novelty wears off, which is why Jeep knows if it deletes the dirty gas engine and replaces it with batteries charged by magical clean electricity generated far from your house in ways you shouldn’t ask questions about, you won’t even miss your more affordable but awful trail rig."

Supposedly it will give you 400 miles of driving range, although we wonder how much it will be in the real world, especially when temperatures dip below freezing. Most importantly, this doesn’t look like a trail machine at all, so Jeep is further abandoning its roots. But wait, there’s more."
