<h2 id="2020-s-shift-to-reader-revenue">2020's shift to reader revenue</h2>
<p>This extract from the <a href="http://bit.ly/mediamoments2020"><em>Media Moments</em></a> report rounds up some key facts and experiences about shifting to reader revenue. The layout makes me itch to spend about 20 minutes formatting it in a way to make the information more accessible and browsable, but the core content is worth your time. </p>

<h2 id="inevitable-but-revealing-substack-story">Inevitable (but revealing) Substack story</h2>
<p>One day, I'd like to do a round-up without referring to Substack. </p>
<p>Today is not that day. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting profile of one of the most successful Substack authors:</p>

            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">She is the breakout star of the newsletter platform Substack, doing the opposite of most media as she calmly situates the news of the day in the long sweep of American history.</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.nytimes.com/vi-assets/static-assets/apple-touch-icon-28865b72953380a40aa43318108876cb.png" alt><span class="kg-bookmark-author">NYTimes</span></div>

    </a></figure>
<p>The thing it catches, I think, is that the big successes are often doing new things with the medium, rather than ramming old wine into new bottles.</p>
<h2 id="responsible-reporting-on-the-vaccines">Responsible reporting on the vaccines</h2>
<p>We're in a weird stage with the pandemic: while the beginning of the end is most likely here with multiple vaccines entering circulation, there's still plenty that could go wrong. And it's possible that the next two months might be the bleakest of the COVID19 crisis. </p>
<p>Vaccination is our best way out — but misinformation is circulating, both intentional and accidental, from non-specialist reporters getting their facts wrong. This piece is a good starting point on getting them right.</p>

<h2 id="never-trust-facebook">Never Trust Facebook</h2>
<p>For the last decade or so, I've maintained that Facebook is a fundamentally untrustworthy company. I'm not just talking about the healthy cynicism all journalists should maintain about companies, but about the very fundamentals of the social network company's culture being self-serving and hostile to others.</p>
<p>This excellent piece of work by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism is just more fuel for the fire:</p>

<p>One link from outside the journalism and digital business for you. Reading books has been a real boon to my mental health over the last year. There's some excellent advice here on how to make reading rather than doom-scrolling a habit. </p>

<h2 id="book-recommendation-wintering">Book recommendation: Wintering</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/01/https---bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-public-images-44f05908-5f00-4a31-a873-8a6f8892aeec_317x500.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="317" height="500"></figure>
<p>And, while we're talking about books, here's a recommendation. It was the last book I read in 2020, and it was perfect timing. It’s not just a book about surviving winter, but weathering the difficult and lost moments in your life. The writing is exquisite, drawing you in and making reading on an effortless glide. Under a broadly chronological structure, the book hops around time and location, exploring the issues that arise from a particularly difficult winter in the author’s life.</p>
<p>In many ways, this book is the ultimate antidote to the toxic startup culture that seems to have infected business spilling out of the Silicon Valley VC world. Rather than hustling harder and faster, and throwing any extra energy into a side hustle, this book explores the periods of our lives when we need to conserve energy — and money — survive the storm, and be ready for the next spring.</p>
<p>Life is cyclical, not linear. And this book will truly help you understand what that could mean for the way you live.</p>
