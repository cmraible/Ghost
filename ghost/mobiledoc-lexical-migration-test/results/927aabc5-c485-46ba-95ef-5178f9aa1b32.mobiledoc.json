Workers informed Voodoo Doughnut of the strike, which lasted for two days, during Oregon’s record breaking heat wave where temperatures rose to, or above, 115 degrees. The goal of the strike was to protect workers, while simultaneously encouraging the company to address the growing concern around these dangerous working conditions. As each striking worker returned following the heat wave, they were terminated on the bogus accusation of workplace abandonment."
