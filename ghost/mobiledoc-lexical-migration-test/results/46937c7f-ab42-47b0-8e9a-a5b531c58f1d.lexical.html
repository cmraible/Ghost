<p>Hoonigan has been pushing full force into the world of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/drag-racing-boat-set-record/">drag racing</a> ever since they started racing the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hoonigan-builds-c6-z06-corvette/">Hoonigan</a> in straight-line competition. Over the years, this has evolved past that incredible Mustang and recently two rivals stepped onto the track to go head to head with one another. However, they’re certainly not stock and their drivers are certainly ready to take each other to the limit. There’s just one problem, one of them is a clear underdog.</p>

<p>That would be the 2002 Chevrolet Camaro which features a whopping 6.0-liter LS engine under the hood. On top of that, it’s got a two-speed automatic transmission so it's basically a drag racer's dream. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/700-hp-hemi-henry-j/">700</a> horsepower helps too, or at least it would if it weren't for the fact that the Nissan 240 SX, the Camaro’s competitor, shares the exact figure. On the other side of the aisle, the Japanese sports car has a 6.7-liter LS-based V8 engine and a three-speed automatic transmission. So what exactly is the breaking point that will decide the winner.</p>
<p>Well, as the two cars line up, it becomes clear the obvious size difference and that also comes with a heavy weight disadvantage for the Camaro. This is very well shown as the two pull off the start line and the 3600 lb Camaro initially pulls forward because of better traction but then slowly begins to lag as the 240 SX wizzes by. In total, the Nissan only weighs 2,800lbs which is sort of a massive difference and is probably the main reason why it won both the first and second race. However, in the end the Nissan was only able to beat the Camaro by using an engine platform designed for the Camaro so we all know who the real winner is here… yeah, it's still the Nissan.</p>
