Barrett-Jackson is joining the move back by doing its Fall Auction 2020 in Scottsdale. However, only registered bidders and certain guests will be allowed inside, and you can bet many precautions will be taken. To help get people excited to go and plunk down some big cash, Barrett-Jackson is bringing this 2018 Ford GT and auctioning it with no reserve.",
