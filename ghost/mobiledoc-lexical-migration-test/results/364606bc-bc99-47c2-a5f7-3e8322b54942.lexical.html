<p>Last year was a very good year for Consolidated Edison, the massive investor-owned power company that provides electricity to the New York area. As CEO Timothy Cawley announced during the company’s September earnings call, it just notched its record-setting 47th straight year of dividend increases. That means ConEd is just three boom years away from being crowned a “dividend king,” meaning it will join the elite group of publicly traded companies whose dividends have increased every year for half a century.</p>
<p>But to maintain this profitable winning streak, the power company had to make some very callous business decisions about its customers in the middle of the raging pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>President Biden is angling to slash his progressive $3.5 trillion Build Back Better package to somewhere between $1.9 and $2.2 trillion. That range would make the entire reconciliation bill roughly <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-big-business-of-future-wars/">one-quarter the size of the post-Afghan War Pentagon budget</a> over the same time period.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>Last month, Timothy Cawley, CEO of Consolidated Edison, which provides power to the New York area and is one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the country, had good news to share during the company’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457719-consolidated-edison-inc-s-ed-ceo-timothy-cawley-presents-wolfe-2021-utilities-midstream-and">September earnings call</a>. ConEd had increased its shareholder dividends every year for the past 47 years, boasted Cawley, noting it was “the longest such streak of any utility.”</p>
<p>That means ConEd is a “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/11-best-dividend-aristocrats-over-142310204.html">dividend aristocrat</a>,” part of an exclusive club of publicly traded companies whose stocks have produced increasing dividends every year for at least 25 years. The utility is also very close to becoming part of an even more elite group: “dividend kings,” public companies whose dividends have increased every year for 50-plus years.</p>
<p>To maintain that winning streak, ConEd has made some very callous business decisions.</p>
<p>Last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged New York City, the utility could have chosen to protect <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=ENERGYBILL&s_state=00036">the more than two million New Yorkers</a> struggling to pay their utility bills by not increasing its rates. Or it could maintain its attractiveness to long-term investors by hiking people’s utility bills.</p>
<p>Any guess what ConEd chose to do?</p>
<p>That’s right: ConEd customers were hit with a cumulative <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/01/17/con-ed-rate-utility-gas-electricity-hikes-approved-">13.5 percent electricity hike and 25 percent gas rate hike.</a> At the same time, area residents saw their utility bills’ supply charges — the fee for sending electricity to the customer — <a href="https://bklyner.com/high-electric-bills-catch-residents-unaware-its-not-just-the-rate-hike/">nearly double</a> in average cost from February 2020.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>As a result, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZHeMGibcud_WFwrpLeulxoTqvX1vNj8K/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105149403741240374985&rtpof=true&sd=true">amount of outstanding utility debt owed</a> by ConEd customers jumped a whopping 189 percent between February 2020 and August 2021. It was the largest debt spike of any utility company in the state — and part of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/13/us-utility-bills-shutoffs-debt-covid-coronavirus">$20 billion national upswell</a> in utility debt during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Although ConEd and state lawmakers threw customers a bone during the pandemic by <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/s1453/amendment/b">suspending service shutoffs</a> for unpaid bills, the measure only allowed customers to defer bill payments, and didn’t cancel the debt altogether. And while ConEd also <a href="https://www.coned.com/en/about-us/media-center/news/coronavirus/updates?utm_campaign=covid&utm_source=offline&utm_medium=cpc">touted its move</a> to waive late-payment fees during the pandemic, the utility then turned around last spring and <a href="https://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7BB4F311E8-8417-4242-BBCD-E5C33FC1E0D0%7D">petitioned the state</a> to allow it to assess a surcharge on its entire customer base to recover the revenue it lost from this move.</p>
<p>ConEd <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/01/17/con-ed-rate-utility-gas-electricity-hikes-approved-">told state officials</a> it would use the revenues it gained from squeezing customers “to invest in gas and electric infrastructure, as well as fund energy efficient programs.” But those measures also mean massive profits.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pubadvocate.nyc.gov/reports/municipalizing-new-york-citys-electric-grid/?link_id=1&can_id=fa57e02488646b303d34f3fcd3f80e83&source=email-re-can-you-chip-in-15-before-midnight-firstname-default-team-3&email_referrer=email_891118&email_subject=restoring-power-to-the-people#22">report</a> from New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams noted that thanks to the $1.38 billion ConEd earned in net income in 2018, it was able to distribute $846 million to shareholders, shell out manager bonuses, and pay Cawley $9.8 million in CEO compensation.</p>
<p>“When one considers the profits that utilities like ConEd are able to make through these rising rates, the injustice of the mechanisms in place are made even clearer,” noted Williams in the report. “This shareholder and executive compensation amounts to nothing less than a massive wealth transfer from ordinary New Yorkers to the highest of income earners.” The report echoes an <a href="https://bklyner.com/public-ownership-utilities-town-halls/">increasingly popular clarion call</a> for the public to take back control of investor-owned utilities like ConEd.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Cawley is expecting more boom years to come for ConEd — which likely means more pain for its customers. As the CEO noted in the September earnings call, “Things are picking up and I'm an optimist, but it feels like we're heading in a really good direction.”</p>

    <li><strong>RED SEA SUPERTANKER ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE: </strong>The F.S.O. Safer, a 45-year-old vessel in the Red Sea with over a million barrels of oil aboard, is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/11/the-ship-that-became-a-bomb">on the verge of exploding</a> or sinking. An explosion could pollute the air for 8 million Yemenis, <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/status/1445504015047946240?s=21">block a major shipping channel</a>, exacerbate existing famine, and kill thousands. Expected cleanup costs from a spill total $20 billion. “Since the boilers on the Safer stopped working, the ship has been a tinderbox, vulnerable to a static-electric spark, a discharged weapon, a tossed cigarette butt,” according to the <em>New Yorker</em>.<br></li>
    <li><strong>HIRING LAGS AFTER UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS END: </strong>The latest <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.b.htm">jobs report</a> shows employers only added 194,000 jobs in September, the <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/10/08/sept-eight-million-removed-from-ui-only-194000-new-jobs/">worst month of job growth</a> since President Biden took office and the second-worst since last May. The Biden administration allowed eight million people to lose pandemic unemployment benefits on Labor Day, just a few months after a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/enhanced-unemployment-aid-ending-hiring-job-growth/">dozen Republican-led states</a> cut people off unemployment assistance early, in a failed attempt to grow the workforce. <br></li>
    <li><strong>MORE CORPORATE LOBBYISTS ELECTED TO THE DNC: </strong>Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison <a href="https://twitter.com/Sludge/status/1447687460197183497?t=ZsmiFbqSs1SOZqgD_8pxSw&s=19">won overwhelming approval</a> of his 75 at-large member nominees at the party’s virtual fall meeting last weekend, inviting in a new slate of corporate lobbyists representing the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical, and military industries, among others. Harrison selected the nominees without DNC member input, continuing past DNC Chair Tom Perez’s tradition of top-down decision-making. According to <em>Sludge</em>, “Last summer, delegates to the virtual Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee <a href="https://readsludge.com/2020/08/05/corporate-lobbyists-vote-to-keep-corporate-lobbyists-in-the-dnc/">hastily rejected</a> a reform proposal that would have barred corporate lobbyists from serving as DNC members by a vote of 122-46.”</li>

    <li><strong>COP WHO BOASTED ABOUT HITTING PROTESTERS FACES MINIMAL PUNISHMENT: </strong>This week, Boston Police Department sergeant Clifton McHale, who was caught on police body camera footage bragging about driving into George Floyd demonstrators last summer, <a href="https://amp.wbur.org/news/2021/10/08/boston-police-suspend-sergeant-who-bragged-about-hitting-george-floyd-demonstrators?__twitter_impression=true">began an 8-day suspension</a> over the incident. An internal Boston PD investigation determined McHale did not strike anyone with his vehicle, but was charged with conduct “unbecoming of a police officer.” McHale’s <a href="https://eoinhiggins.substack.com/p/boston-cop-who-bragged-about-running">first misconduct investigation</a> was in 2005, over allegations of sexual assault against an intoxicated woman while in uniform. <br></li>
    <li><strong>BILLIONAIRE BANKROLLS TEXAS BORDER WALL:</strong> Wyoming-based billionaire Timothy Mellon <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/06/timothy-mellon-texas-border-wall/">contributed $53.1 million</a>, or 98 percent of total donations, to Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s $54-million border wall fund. Mellon has a history of financing efforts to defend malicious immigration laws. “The thing that’s controversial about these kinds of donations is whether they’re distorting government priorities,” said Notre Dame Law School Professor Lloyd Mayer in a <em>Texas Tribune </em>article about the bequest. If you open it up to donations, you’re handing what the government should spend their money on to wealthy donors.”</li>
