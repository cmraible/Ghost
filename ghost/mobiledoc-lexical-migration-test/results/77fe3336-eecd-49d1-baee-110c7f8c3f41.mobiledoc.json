Get ready for precise driving and lots of crashing/practice in this arcade style driving game focused entirely on the automotive art of drifting. It breaks the mold of most driving games and what you wind up with is a game that's fun and challenging but never feels unfair or overly technical. The simplicity is where it really shines: the controls, graphics and concept are all bare bones and better off for it."
