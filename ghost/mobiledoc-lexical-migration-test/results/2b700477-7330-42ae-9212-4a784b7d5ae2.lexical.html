<p>Like many today, pickup trucks back in the day were workhorses. Take this <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28444/1956-chevrolet-3100-cameo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1956 Chevrolet 3100 Cameo</a>. It no doubt labored hard for some time, hauling all kinds of cargo and possibly towing a number of trailers. After being put through the ringer, it’s amazing the pickup looks so impeccably good. The reason is a more recent frame-off restoration and now the Chevy is dressed to impress.</p>

<p>Everything about the exterior of this 3100 Cameo presents well. The red paint looks almost like it was just poured on, it glistens with as if it were wet. Chrome on the bumpers, hood ornament, etc. appears fresh as well. All the body panels are straight and the correct badges are in their appropriate places. You’ll notice in the bed are some nice oak slats, which are finished for a rich, natural look that everyone loves in these old trucks. The rest of the payload is painted white, with nary a scratch visible, showing a truly thorough restoration and light use afterward. Completing the factory look are OE steel wheels, which have nice wide white wall tires wrapped around them, just like you’d see back in the day.</p>
<p>Just because this truck is a hard worker doesn’t mean it won’t treat you right. The interior comes with some nice surprises like aftermarket air conditioning, so you’re not roasting during summertime cruises. A retro-fit radio doesn’t ruin the aesthetics of the cab while it allows you to listen to your tunes without trouble. The red and white color scheme is nice, while the upholstery and carpeting are free of major wear or damage.</p>
<p>Every workhorse needs a stout heart. This one uses a 265ci V8 engine A Powerglide automatic transmission means you don’t need to wrangle a difficult clutch or anything like that.</p>
<p>Introduced in 1955, the Cameo was a stylish addition to Chevy’s truck lineup. Sleek lines and a wrap-around windshield mimicked styling from cars of the time, departing from the mostly plain design of pickups before it.
