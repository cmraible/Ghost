<p>Good things are happening! The proposal of a new constitution in Chile leaves behind the Pinochet era, enshrining the rights of workers and the environment. Also, California is tired of dangerous prices for insulin and will invest in producing its own low-cost options. Californians will also receive inflation-relief checks, and congressional staffers are organizing to demand climate action from Democratic leadership. Many of the staffers have been working on key climate policy for years, and they are now escalating their organizing commitments to go after stalling leadership.</p>
<p>All this and much more in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-chile-proposes-new-constitution/">this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em></a>, exclusively for supporting subscribers.</p>
