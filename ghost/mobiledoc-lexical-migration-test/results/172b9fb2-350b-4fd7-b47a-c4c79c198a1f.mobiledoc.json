That pairing is featured on the door panels and dash as well, plus plenty of brightwork all around, including on the headliner, shows the level of luxurious detail Cadillac put into this car.

This car also uses the Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission, which GM debuted in 1956. It boasts smooth gear transitions, representing GM’s engineering might for the time.  This car is wonderful for driving slow through city streets, making it perfect to take out and participate in classic car cruise and parades. It’s also quite comfortable on the open road."
