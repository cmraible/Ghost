<p><em>The Lever</em>, formerly known as <em>The Daily Poster,</em> is a reader-supported investigative news outlet that holds accountable the people and corporations manipulating the levers of power. The organization was founded by owner David Sirota, an award-winning journalist and Oscar-nominated writer who served as the presidential campaign speechwriter for Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em>’s<em></em>reporting, podcasts, videos, and live events focus on politics, business and corruption — and how money shapes and distorts economic and environmental policy. All of our stories are sourced to documents and facts, and the documents and facts are linked so that readers can review and verify them. </p>
<p>We believe a functioning democracy requires a vibrant independent media and aggressive reporting, rather than corporate media promoting propaganda. </p>
<p>We believe fearless subscriber-supported journalism can create leverage that forces politicians and corporations to fulfill their promises.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Archimedes: We believe that with a strong enough lever, we can help move the world.</p>
