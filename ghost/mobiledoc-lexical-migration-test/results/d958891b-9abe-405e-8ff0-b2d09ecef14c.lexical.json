Some might say it looks like a Volkswagen Beetle had a child with a corvette, others might call it a frankenstein disaster. Either way this crushed-looking Corvette is something that steals attention from everything else and it's gonna take every bit of criticism that comes its way.",

Essentially it looks like the builder went for a steeper approach to the rear windshield likely mimicking some European models. Looking at some ads quickly, you find out that this car is currently on the market with what looks like an $11,000 price tag. It’s pretty funny reading some of the listing for it and watching the writers try desperately to find a positive about this car. At the end of the day though it is still perfectly running and driving C-5 Corvette with a 5.7 L LS1 under the hood which pretty much makes it worth it and many people‘s eyes. Do you think this car is worth $11,000?",
