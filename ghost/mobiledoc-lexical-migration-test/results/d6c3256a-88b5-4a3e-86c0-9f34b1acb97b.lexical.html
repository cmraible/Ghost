<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/rebecca/">Rebecca Burns</a></p>
<p>Six environmental groups will consider legal action if the Department of Transportation fails to act on a key rail safety rule, the groups wrote Thursday <a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/2023.02.16_letter_to_secretary_buttigieg_re_ecp_brake_appeal_with_attachments.pdf">in a letter</a> to Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p>
<p>The rule in question would force railroads to begin upgrading freight trains’ Civil War-era braking systems to newer, electronically controlled brakes allowing for faster and safer stops. In 2017, after rail industry donors delivered <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2022&ind=m04">more than $6 million</a> to GOP campaigns, President Donald Trump’s administration repealed the 2015 rule requiring the newer brakes in some trains transporting hazardous materials, as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/"><em>The Lever </em>reported</a> last week.</p>
<p>In 2018, environmental groups, including Earthjustice and the Sierra Club, <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/PHMSA-2017-0102-0045">appealed the move</a> by the Trump administration, citing a faulty cost-benefit analysis used to justify the repeal. An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wv-state-wire-north-america-donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-2e91c7211b4947de8837ebeda53080b9mp-us-news-ap-top-news-transportation-1936e77a11924c909880f1ef014c7ca7">investigation</a> earlier that year from the <em>Associated Press</em> revealed that the Trump administration omitted at least $117 million in estimated damages from train derailments when it determined that the costs of upgrading electronic braking systems would exceed the benefits.</p>

<p>The groups’ appeal is still pending. According to the letter, under federal administrative law, a regulatory agency has 90 days to respond to appeals. But neither the Trump nor the Biden administrations have responded to date, Kristen Boyles, a managing attorney at Earthjustice who authored the letter to Buttigieg, told <em>The Lever</em>.</p>
<p>“We frankly expected little response from the Department under the prior administration — after all, it had just eliminated the updated brake requirements — but the silence has continued well into the Biden administration,” <a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/2023.02.16_letter_to_secretary_buttigieg_re_ecp_brake_appeal_with_attachments.pdf">reads the letter.</a></p>
<p>Facing pressure from lawmakers and the public in the wake of the fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, <a href="https://twitter.com/SecretaryPete/status/1625628605861462016">Buttigieg wrote</a> on Twitter Tuesday that he is “constrained by law on some areas of rail regulation,” citing a law passed by Congress in 2015 that helped pave the way for the repeal of the brake requirement.</p>
<p>At the behest of rail lobbyists, <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/fastact/">that 2015 law</a> included a provision requiring the Transportation Department to redo an earlier cost-benefit analysis on the implementation of electronic brakes. But there’s nothing stopping Buttigieg’s department from updating the faulty analysis as a first step to reinstating the braking requirement, rail and administrative law experts <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pretends-hes-powerless-to-reduce-derailment-risks/">told <em>The Lever </em>this week<em>.</em></a></p>
<p>That’s what the environmental groups are asking Buttigieg to do now. After years of sounding the alarm about the dangers of so-called “bomb trains” transporting liquefied natural gas and crude oil by rail — like the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42548824">one that derailed in Quebec in 2014</a>, killing 47 people — Earthjustice’s Boyles said that the Ohio disaster this month highlights the need for urgent action to protect communities and the environment.</p>
<p>In addition to ongoing concerns about the health of residents in East Palestine and its immediate vicinity, <a href="https://response.epa.gov/sites/15933/files/Norfolk%20Southern%20East%20Palestine%20Train%20Derailment%20General%20Notice%20Letter%202.10.2023.pdf">the Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed</a> that hazardous chemicals spilled into the Ohio River, the <a href="https://ohioriverfdn.org/ohio-river/quick-facts/#:~:text=The%20Ohio%20River%20is%20the,the%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers.">source of drinking water for 5 million people</a>.</p>
<p>“It should not take another exploding train to get the Department of Transportation’s attention,” said Boyles.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Southern train that derailed this month in Ohio would not have been covered by the braking rule because it was not classified as a “high-hazard flammable train” — the result of a push by the chemical industry to narrow the definition and the attendant safety requirements during the initial 2015 rule-making.</p>

<p>At the time, the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent agency investigating this month’s train accident, requested that the rules cover the category of hazardous materials that <a href="https://webwiser.nlm.nih.gov/substance?substanceId=43&identifier=Vinyl%20chloride&identifierType=name&menuItemId=2&catId=163">includes</a> vinyl chloride, the chemical on board the Norfolk Southern train that was released and burned by crews.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Ohio Gov. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/ohio-train-derailment-east-palestine-chemicals-update-governor-mike-dewine/">Mike DeWine</a> (R) and Pennsylvania <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pretends-hes-powerless-to-reduce-derailment-risks/">Gov. Josh Shapiro</a> (D) have both called on federal officials to consider expanding the definition of “high-hazard flammable trains.”</p>
<p>In their letter to Buttigieg, the environmental groups asked for a “long overdue” response to their administrative appeal filed in 2018.</p>
<p>“If we do not hear from you with a timeline for such a response, we will consider taking legal action, but we would prefer to work this out with you,” the letter reads.</p>
