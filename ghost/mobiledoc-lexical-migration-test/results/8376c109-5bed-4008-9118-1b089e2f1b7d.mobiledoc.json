          " is absolutely remarkable. The graphics look like they’re straight out of a children’s pop-up book brought to life: all the environments are meticulously detailed and layered to great effect. The staging looks like an animated stage play; the sense of immersion these visuals allow is incredibly satisfying, especially when paired with the music. The soundtrack sounds cartoonishly western in the best possible way. The guitar and fiddle riffs may seem cliche but in a way, that feels appropriate in this sardonic western."

          " is how illogical the puzzles seem and how counterintuitive making progress is. The game begins with the wheel of your wagon breaking and your friend being apparently trapped underneath it, awaiting the local mechanic to help fix the wagon and free them. Logically this would seem like the first thing you should do in order to progress the story but you exhaust this thread pretty quickly and are left to explore the town of Odella. While this may not seem like a big deal, after you find the mechanic and convince them to help you, they do...nothing. They say that they’ll come when a new wheel arrives but give you nothing to go on as far as initiating that progress. In my playthrough, I then spoke to everyone on the map and made some decent progress but inevitably hit a wall. This block was caused by a mixed bag of my own incompetence, weird disjointed puzzles and a confusing aesthetic choice. "

Eventually, I admitted defeat and referenced a walkthrough to get a better idea of how to progress. Perhaps it’s indicative of a personal bias but the walkthrough only confirmed my suspicion that the puzzles are too tenuous to be enjoyable. Even as I watched the walkthrough play, I couldn’t imagine that I ever would’ve made certain connections on my own. Apparently the game can be completed in about 2 hours but I spent longer than that walking in circles hopelessly confused. It’s very possible that I just suck at point and click adventure games (they’re not in my usual wheelhouse) but it does feel like very little effort was made to make this title accessible to newcomers. Not realising that a diamond ring is necessary to rob a bank hardly feels like a fault of any player as much as it is a logical fallacy integral to the game."
