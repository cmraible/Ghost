<p>Loading any beloved car on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/worst-car-transport/">transport truck</a> can be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ranger-rover-damaged/">risky business</a>, as clearly demonstrated by this photo of a C8 Corvette crushed by a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-fleeing-police-wedges-maserati/">Maserati Levante</a>. While painful to look at, especially since so few people who want C8s have been able to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gm-c8-corvettes-at-capacity/">get their hands on one</a>, it’s also necessary for everyone to understand the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-almost-kill-employee/">inherent risks</a>. Choose your vehicle transport company wisely, making sure they carry insurance, etc.</p>

<p>The Maserati Levante which crushed the poor American sports car weighs about 5,000 lbs., so it’s a portly one. We’re not sure what happened here, but if we had to guess we’d say it was probably <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-kills-innocent-driver/">operator error</a>. That top ramp can be lowered to get the vehicles on the second level off the transporter, but you have to move the rear car on the lower level first.</p>
<p>It’s possible the Italian crossover exceeded the weight rating for that portion of the carrier, but we can’t confirm that’s the case. The hope is that the transport company makes this right, but depending on the extent of the C8’s damage that might just involve a payout for the entire car.</p>
<p>This photo was originally posted to the Custom Corvettes Facebook group, with the person who shared it commenting, “can you say… FIRED????” Yes, someone probably got sacked over this and rightfully so, because what a screwup.</p>
<p>A number of members in the group commented about someone waiting forever to get their new C8 Corvette only to find out it was crushed. However, this car obviously isn’t brand new since it has a tag on the rear, plus it doesn’t have any of the shipping protectors attached. Still, we can’t imagine what the owner is feeling at this point, whether they’ve owned the car for a bit or just bought it off someone else.</p>
