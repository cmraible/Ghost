As a progression of the 206 GT model, it would retain many of the features from its predecessor but would be built on a longer wheelbase while also getting a larger engine. It was powered by a 195-horsepower 2.4-liter V6 engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. Of the 357 cars built from April 1969 to October 1970 all of them were "

          "This Ferrari Dino 246 GT was originally intended for U.S. import and was originally sold to Evan E. Kimble, possibly of the Kimble Glass Company. While it is unclear if the car ever actually made it to the U.S., as Kimble was reported to have been living in Germany at the time, the car was registered with New Jersey plates. In 1988, the car was sold with a reported 50k-miles showing to Christopher Joel of Surrey, England for £10,000. A complete restoration was done by Ferrari specialist Kevin O'Rourke of Moto Technique Ltd of Surrey and the car was converted to right-hand-drive and fitted with a new speedometer showing 0-miles. Restoration costs at the time totaled to over £83k. "
