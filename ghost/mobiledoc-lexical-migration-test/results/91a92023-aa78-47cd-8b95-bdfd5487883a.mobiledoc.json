This engine was available with a gated six-speed manual, but for optimal track performance, Ferrari's high-tech F1 automated manual transmission is the way to go. In addition to having less than 20,000 actual miles, this Ferrari has been excellently maintained over the years and it's fresh off a complete recommended service less than 3,000 miles ago. On top of that, it rides on a brand-new set of high-performance tires, which means this car is ready for business whether it's out on the road course or the back roads."
