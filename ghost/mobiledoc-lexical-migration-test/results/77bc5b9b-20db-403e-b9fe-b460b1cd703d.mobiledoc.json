It has nice use of chrome, two-tone paint, swooping lines, tasteful fins, and those iconic rocket-style taillights. This one rolls on the stately factory wheels with period-correct wide whitewall tires, adding the luscious feel of the exterior."

When you sit in this car, it feels so much more open, yet there’s protection from the elements at the same time. Imagine driving through a scenic canyon when the leaves are changing in the fall, staring up at the array of colors through this roof. It’s a breathtaking feature you can cover up using a custom-made shade, which is a huge plus on sunny days."

You get the charm of factory controls in the dash, while the backseat has a fold-down armrest. This is a machine of fine elegance, something you use to cruise through places leisurely."
