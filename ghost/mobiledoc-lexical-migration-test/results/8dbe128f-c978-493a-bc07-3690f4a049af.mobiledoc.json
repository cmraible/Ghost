It seems like everyone wants to get their hands on the mid-engine Chevy sports car, and that does unfortunately include thieves. The sad reality is these days car theft is an exploding problem which seems to be spreading from high-crime areas to even quiet rural communities."

In a video which we’ve included, he leaves his Corvette running while he walks far enough away that the key shouldn’t be communicating with the vehicle. Then his son climbs inside and drives off."

That sounds idiotic since everyone knows you should lock the doors of a running vehicle if you’re not sitting in it. The problem is if you open the driver’s door and then hit the door lock button, it doesn’t keep the doors locked. That measure is something you find on other vehicles as a way to prevent unintentional lockouts, but it means some people think they’re locking their ride when it’s really just a sitting duck."

Short trips where the engine doesn’t reach normal operating temperature can lead to carbon buildup in the engine, which later can cause all kinds of problems. You also might not want to climb inside a freezing cold cabin or you need to defog/defrost the windows, which takes time when the car is cold. Just remember, when you do leave the engine running, lock the doors using the fob instead of using the door lock switch on the door."
