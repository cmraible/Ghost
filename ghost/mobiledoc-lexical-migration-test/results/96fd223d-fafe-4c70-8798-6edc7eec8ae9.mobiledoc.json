Not only is it sporting huge fender flares to cover the much wider tires, a full rollcage, and many other handmade modifications, what you see poking out of the hood feeds a 400ci LSX V8 with an earth-shattering 808-horsepower on tap. Helping direct that power to the rear wheels is a G-Force GF4A transmission. That’s a hefty setup, and while this thing only tips the scale at 3,165 lbs. it actually makes this Pontiac the porker in this race."

Instead of running a Bimmer engine, this thing has a 7.3-liter LS V8 with 600-hp, so technically this is a potent German-American car. Add to that a Samsonas Sequential Transmission and suddenly this Global Time Attack seems pretty freaking serious."
