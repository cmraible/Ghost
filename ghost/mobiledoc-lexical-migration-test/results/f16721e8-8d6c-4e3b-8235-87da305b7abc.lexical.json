It’s not too hard to guess the thieves bit off more performance than they could handle. What’s more, the windshield had been kicked out from the inside, so the crooks likely had been trapped from the body deforming in the wreck and instead of calling for help, extricated themselves. It’s good to see criminals being more self-reliant these days.",
