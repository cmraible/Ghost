Thankfully, California Highway Patrol caught these guys in the act, but we’re sure they don’t catch everyone. Here’s to hoping these guys and maybe some other people learn the lesson to not race on public roads, putting innocent drivers and passengers in danger. Better yet, take it to a track or private, enclosed road where you can race to your heart’s content."
