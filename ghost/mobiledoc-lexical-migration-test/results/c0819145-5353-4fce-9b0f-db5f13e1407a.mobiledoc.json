That might not sound shocking at all, especially since we’ve covered some pretty high-flying dealership heists in the past, but this one comes with a mystery that has the "

The good news is there’s a fairly easy fix for the problem. Signal-blocking material sold in rolls at many online stores allow you to turn any enclosure into a Faraday Cage, so the dealership could do that with their key storage box. Actually, all dealers should do the same since we’ve seen thieves use this trick to swipe cars."
