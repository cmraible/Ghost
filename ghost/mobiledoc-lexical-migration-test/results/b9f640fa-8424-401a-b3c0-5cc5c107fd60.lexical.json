One is a single-user (guys does 5,000 person baseball live rumours chat). Pricing for him ~$25.\n2. Multiple authors – media organisations. ~$100 for them.\n\n<div>Tiers are based on how often you use it and audience sizes.</div><div></div><div>25m page views in recent months. Page views are understated – you go to that page and never refresh. </div><div></div><div>People have raised that as a problem. The pendulum is swinging away from page views towards reader engagement, Keith suggests. That’s monetised in a different way.</div><div></div><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\">[![Keith McSpurren of CoverItLive](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2009/05/DSCF1026-thumb-230x142-1313.jpg?resize=230%2C142)](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2009/05/DSCF1026.jpg)</span>\n\n<div>Odd use cases: signing day in the States, where people declare which universities they’re going to, the G20 protests here, NFL draft, earnings conference calls. </div><div></div><div>[Matthew Ingram’s experimenting](http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2009/04/30/the-benefits-of-a-live-blog/) getting a lot of praise.</div><div></div><div>Pure Q&As are big – for example, Hollywood directors. The comment management is really important for that.</div><div></div><div>If you’re just using it for a comments board, you’re missing the point. If you treat it as being clubby, you cap the potential use. It’s not a chat tool. Democratisation of content doesn’t need to be 24/7. There’s a value in good writers. The software is more like a talk show than a collaboration tool. Sometimes realtime coverage is better than other situations.</div><div></div><div>Don’t feel you have to show all comments. Just add the ones that bring value. Otherwise, you get gobbledegook – people fighting with each other. “Go to rooms like that, as see how long before you want to put a revolver in your mouth.”</div><div></div><div>Meebo rooms are for pure peer-to-peer chat. This is for more broadcast situation.  </div><div></div><div>In a “thousands of comments” situation, people often repeat themselves. Just publish a representative sample. “I’ve seen 63,000 of these things – trust me. Craft content out of this.”</div><div></div><div>Now accepts things like Qik – we they add their own video? They allow most live streaming type sites. When appropriate they defer to third party apps that can be integrated into CoverItLive. </div><div></div><div>The software will evolve as the needs of journalists evolve – but it also needs to stay easy to use. “Getting money out of newspapers right now is a minor miracle” – one reason for keeping the company really small (4 people). </div><div></div><div>And…we’re done.</div></div>\n"
