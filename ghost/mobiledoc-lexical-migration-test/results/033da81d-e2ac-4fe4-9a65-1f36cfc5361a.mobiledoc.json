The engine features double camshafts and was based on the V8 used in the Lamborghini Silhouette. That setup is good for a factory-rated 255-horsepower and 225 lb.-ft. of torque, so this sports car can get moving and provide plenty of good times on the road. On top of that, handling is excellent for a 1980s vehicle, so this is a great weekend ride."
