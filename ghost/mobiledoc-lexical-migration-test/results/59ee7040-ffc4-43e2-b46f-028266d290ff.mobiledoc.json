The original engine has been replaced with a comparable 4.2-liter with the stock specifications and the Jaguar is said to have been well maintained and garage kept. With a starting price of $130,000, this seems like a good opportunity for a Jaguar enthusiast to get their hands on one of the most celebrated cars of all time."
