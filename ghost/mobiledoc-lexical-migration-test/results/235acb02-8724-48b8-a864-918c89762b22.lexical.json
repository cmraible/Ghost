For those that see a pre-200-horsepower rating as too little, remember the RS010’s lightweight design means that the engine is only carrying 1,350-lbs. What this means is that the car's power-weight ratio, .014:1, is equivalent to the average V8 powered car but without the weighty feel that degrades a cars ability in the corners. This recipe should make for a car with staggering performance, strong acceleration and nimble handling.",
