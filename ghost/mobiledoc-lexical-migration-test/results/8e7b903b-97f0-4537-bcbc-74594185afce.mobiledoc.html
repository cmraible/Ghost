<hr>
<p>Perhaps you’ve been blessed to drive a classic like this <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10753&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1994 Austin Mini Cooper</a>. This little car is a blast, even in comparison with the admittedly entertaining modern Mini cars. While not as high-powered as some vehicles, this little Mini is lightweight and extremely maneuverable, which is why these have done so well in motorsports events throughout the years. This particular one, which is a rare left-hand-drive model, is being offered to the public by <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/default.aspx&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Carlisle Auctions</a> during its <a href="https://www.carlisleevents.com/events/events-detail/index?id=fall+carlisle&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Fall Carlisle event</a>.</p>
<p>Like any proper British car, this Austin Mini Cooper proudly wears green with white bonnet stripes and roof. That paint looks like it absolutely gleams in the sunlight along with the polished wheels and chrome trim. So you’re ready for races or just fun drives in less-than-ideal conditions, there are four auxiliary lights mounted up front. This is a well-preserved example of a rare classic.</p>
<p>Originally, the Mini was created as an answer to the call for more fuel-efficient vehicles in post-WWII Britain. It was designed to carry a family, thanks to an interior which is deceptively large. This was achieved in part by pushing the wheels to the four corners, something which also contributes to the amazing handling characteristics of the car.</p>
<p>While it was marketed as a practical vehicle, it didn’t take long for enthusiasts to realize the Mini was a tough little performer. The transverse-mounted four-cylinder engine up front provides spirited acceleration and when coupled with solid road dynamics makes for quite the driver’s car.</p>
<p>Since production began in 1959, the design and production process for the Mini Cooper was greatly improved by 1994. That means this car is well-made and should be a solid addition to your collection.</p>
<p>Now offering phone bidding and is in-person bidding, Fall Auction is part of the <a href="https://www.carlisleevents.com/events/events-detail/index?id=fall+carlisle&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Fall Carlisle event</a> (automotive flea market and car corral) which takes place Sept. 30-Oct. 4 on the Carlisle Fairgrounds.</p>
