<p>What would you do if you had one chance to change history? Would you do what is best for the world, or would you do what is best — or easiest — for you? That is the subject of many of the stories we explore in this week’s Weekend Reader. One article reveals how rare-metal interests are rushing to mine the deepest parts of the ocean, with little regard to the disastrous consequences for a part of the world we know very little about. Another story details how a tiny activist investment firm had the guts to stand up to a fossil fuel giant, and ended up securing a major victory. And an illuminating profile depicts West Virginia Democratic Joe Manchin as “a man standing athwart history, not quite yelling ‘Stop,’ but certainly yelling ‘Whoa.’”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/exxon-mobil-engine-no-1-board.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage"><strong>The Little Hedge Fund Taking Down Big Oil</strong></a> (The New York Times) <em>— “In the past few years, an increasing number of proposals have aimed to pressure large corporations, and especially oil-and-gas companies, to respond to climate change; more than 1,600 such proposals have been filed since 2010. Of those, less than half were put to a vote, and just a tiny sliver gained majority support; even successful resolutions are nonbinding, so companies can still dismiss them afterward. But when an activist wins board seats, companies have to choke back their dissatisfaction and accept their new directors.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-deep-sea-is-filled-with-treasure-but-it-comes-at-a-price"><strong>The Deep Sea Is Filled with Treasure, But It Comes at a Price</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “The International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, in a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A., which has been described as “chronically overlooked” and is so obscure that even many Jamaicans don’t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe. Under international law, countries control the waters within two hundred miles of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered ‘the common heritage of mankind.’ This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://grist.org/accountability/oil-gas-bankruptcy-fieldwood-energy-petroshare/"><strong>How Bankruptcy Lets Oil And Gas Companies Evade Cleanup Rules</strong></a><strong></strong>(Grist) <em>— “Fieldwood is one of more than 260 oil and gas companies that has filed for bankruptcy in the last six years. With low prices and suppressed demand for oil and gas over the last year, operators have struggled to stay afloat. Many have been turning to bankruptcy in an attempt to shed their debts, reorganize their assets, and, in some cases, offload their environmental obligations. Utilizing limitations and loopholes in bankruptcy law, these companies are employing a playbook perfected by coal companies to shed their environmental and labor liabilities.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/28/the-man-who-controls-the-senate"><strong>The Man Who Controls The Senate</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “In Manchin’s laments about radical politics and the pace of change, one could hear the protests of a man standing athwart history, not quite yelling ‘Stop,’ but certainly yelling ‘Whoa.’ If Republicans regain the majority in 2022, his moment of prominence will be over as abruptly as it arrived. What he does until then will determine if the Democratic Party, to which he devoted his career, remembers him as a hero who advanced its goals or as the man who obstructed them. For all of Manchin’s hesitations, politics is changing fast, even in the terrain he calls home.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/06/amazon-journalists-pr-tactics/"><strong>How Amazon Bullies, Manipulates, And Lies To Reporters</strong></a> (Mother Jones) <em>— “It’s not unusual for communications teams for corporations, non-profits, and the government all alike to be withholding in their interactions with the press and to try to spin things in the best possible light. It’s rarer that companies try to mislead and intimidate the press into falling into the lines that they want. But of the dozen journalists I spoke with for this story, most of whom declined to be identified out of concern for professional repercussions, all recalled times Amazon’s press team had engaged in manipulative and sometimes deceitful behavior. According to these writers and editors, and my own experience reporting on the company, Amazon’s comms team readily employs these rarer, bare-knuckle PR tactics. The ultimate result isn’t just that reporters have a harder time writing stories. Some may be deterred from writing on the company at all. And if those that do are deceived and unduly influenced, then by extension the public is as well.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/housing/evictions-halted-for-one-more-month-rental-assistance-stalled-pandemic-relief/"><strong>Evictions Halted For One More Month, But Rental Assistance Is Stalled Too</strong></a> (The American Prospect) <em>— “There are many reasons for the rental assistance failure, from the lack of education about the aid, the hundreds of different local programs with varying levels of requirements, to technological barriers for poor tenants needing an internet connection to fill out forms, and landlords who refused to participate, perhaps relishing the prospect of eventual eviction instead. But all of it boils down really to one thing: There’s simply no established program in existence today that gives cash support to renters.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-21/new-york-just-cause-law-is-about-to-make-workers-much-tougher-to-fire"><strong>Most Americans Can Be Fired for No Reason at Any Time, But a New Law in New York Could Change That</strong></a> (Businessweek) – <em>"Unlike in other wealthy countries, where bosses generally have to provide just cause for termination, at-will positions account for most U.S. jobs. This probably includes your job, dear reader. Most white-collar and professional workers aren’t any more legally protected from their bosses’ whims than Walker was. Google software engineers, Wells Fargo & Co. bankers, and Mayo Clinic surgeons work at will. So do humble Bloomberg reporters."</em></p>
<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster">A Message From The Daily Poster:</h3>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>This week, while enjoying the first backyard get-together with our neighbors in a very, very long time, an interesting question came up: Have you faced key inflection points in your life? Have there been moments when you had to make a major decision that would have long-lasting consequences, and if so, what did you decide?</p>
<p>In reality, we have had to make major life-changing decisions like this at several points since we started <em>The Daily Poster</em>. For starters, in April 2020, David had to follow through with the crazy idea of starting a subscriber-funded news outlet after the insane concept first popped into his head, rather than just pursue any of the million options that would have been far easier. Then he had to decide to build the sort of organization that could support a growing team of reporters and editors breaking regular news scoops, rather than just opt for a far more simple vanity newsletter where he could just put out his own thoughts whenever he felt like it.</p>
<p>Near our one-year anniversary, we had to make the biggest decision of all so far: Whether to stick with running our newsletter on Substack, which seemed to be working out fine, or step into the frightening unknown and build our very own web platform from scratch. We opted for the harder move, and now, as we continue to build, we are staring down new — and increasingly nerve-wracking — inflection points.</p>
<p>Each time we have come to one of these decisions, we have grappled with the fact that depending on how we act, we could end up dooming ourselves to failure. But then we asked ourselves, what do we want to be able to say at the end of the day? That we puttered along and always took the safe choice? Or that even if we went down in flames, at least we gave everything our best shot, and tried to build the sort of news organization we have always wanted to work for?</p>
<p>When we put the matter in such terms, there has never been any doubt about how we are going to proceed. We are always going to make the harder and more terrifying choice, if it gives us a better shot at making real change.</p>
<p>We have been able to do so because each of you have been supporting us — with your subscriptions, your donations, and your words of encouragement. Thank you for always allowing us to embrace the hard and more rewarding decisions — and we hope our efforts serve as inspiration for when you find yourself standing athwart history, too.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Joel</p>
