<hr>
<p>Back in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-block-fox-body-daughter/">the early 1990s</a>, Alpina was where you went to get the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-e36-bmw-m3/">fastest, nastiest BMWs around</a>. While they still exist today, their current creations tend to be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/meet-car-collector-ken-kirkpatrick/">more subdued</a>.</p>

<p>That wasn't the case back when <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/208209/1992-alpina-b10-biturbo">this 1992 Alpina B10 BiTurbo</a> was built, however. The straight six engine was fitted with twin turbochargers, which raised horsepower from around 200 to over 350.</p>
<p>This also resulted in a zero to 60 time that was comparable with exotics of the same era and a top speed of 180 miles per hour. All of this was wrapped up in a four-door package that was even more luxurious than the standard 5 Series.</p>

<p>Just 507 B10 BiTurbos were produced by Alpina during the E34 5 Series' run. Not many found their way to the United States.</p>
<p>This one can be found at <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/208209/1992-alpina-b10-biturbo">Auto Source Group LLC</a> in Doral, Florida. The asking price of just under $70,000 is likely more than you'd expect to pay for an E34 5 Series, but then again, this isn't just any 5 Series.</p>

<p>As BMWs go, the E34 is one of our favorite designs. It's a handsome shape that looks like an E30 3 Series that filled out a little bit. The Alpina wheels and front spoiler add just enough extra flash to visually distinguish the B10 BiTurbo from other E34s.</p>
<p>Alpina's unique blend of bespoke luxury and brutal performance was a winning combination in the 1990s. To this day, these cars have a unique presence unmatched by even the best that BMW's M Division can muster.</p>
