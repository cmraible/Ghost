<p>Some states may have their cutoff date for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/covid-car-parade-minivan/">classic car</a> tags, or how they classify a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/classic-car-market/">car as ‘classic’</a> in terms of what that means in terms of registration, but that’s not always inline with what an enthusiast believes. The term ‘classic’ is a highly debated term that can be applied to one year model of a car, while not the same year/different model of the next. Recently, FIVA (the Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens or international federation of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-finds-ford/">historic vehicles</a>), attempted to clear up how they classify a car to be classic, or historic.</p>
<p>“There’s no magic rule to say when a vehicle becomes a ‘classic’,” says Tiddo Bresters, president of FIVA, “but reaching 30 years of age is one of FIVA’s clear criteria.</p>

<p>“So in 2020 we’re delighted to welcome a whole new raft of 1990 classics to the fold, as they celebrate their 30th birthday, thanks to their caring owners. Historic vehicles don’t have to be hugely rare or valuable; the ‘new classics’ range from supercars to city cars to motorcycles – but all are important milestones in the story of our motoring heritage.”</p>
<p>"Happy 30th birthday to… The remarkable <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/362964/peter-cunninghan-honda-car-collection//">Honda NSX</a>, the first version of the much-admired V6 mid-engined two-seater, offering 160mph in a comfortable, practical, safe package but still a joy to drive."</p>
<p>Another sportscar from Japan, the affordable and attractive Mazda MX-5, reached Japan and the USA the late 1980s, to become the best-selling two-seater convertible in history.</p>
<p>At the other end of the performance spectrum, the Lamborghini Diablo – with its mid-mounted V12 and top speed close to 200mph – went on sale in January 1990.</p>
<p>On two wheels, rather than four, the Harley-Davidson Fat Boy went into production from 1990, a V-twin cruiser motorcycle with solid disc wheels.</p>
<p>What makes a vehicle ‘historic’?  According to FIVA, a historic vehicle is ‘a mechanically propelled road vehicle’ that is:</p>
<p>-At least 30 years old<br>-Preserved and maintained in a historically correct condition<br>-Not used as a means of daily transport<br>-Part of our technical and cultural heritage</p>
<p>Do you agree with this assessment? As an Editor's note, I highly disagree with a car being disqualified from the idea that it's no longer 'historic' or 'classic' if it's driven regularly. While I agree on the importance of keeping the miles off the car, it's more important to maintain and preserve a vehicle than it is to keep it off the road, it is meant to be driven, after all. I suppose this is where we can define 'historic' and 'classic' as being different, although the quotes from the press release intertwine those terms.</p>
