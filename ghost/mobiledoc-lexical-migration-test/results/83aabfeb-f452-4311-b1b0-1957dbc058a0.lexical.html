<p>A special-edition <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-mustang-convertible/">Ford Mustang</a> came about thanks to a promotion by the 7-Up Bottling Company. Just thirty 1990 Ford Mustang LX convertibles were to be given away at the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball finals to 30 people in attendance who could sink a ball from center court in just one try. While that sounds like a great way to take home a limited-edition car, the contest was canceled at the very last minute.</p>
<p>Two of the cars were built when production started in December of 1989. In February of 1990, production went into full swing and were produced as coupes but became convertibles when the hardtop was removed before shipment. While 5,000 of these cars were planned, only 4,103 were actually built and all examples were finished in Deep Emerald Green Clearcoat Metallic. A total of 1,360 of these <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/192683/1993-ford-mustang-cobra-svt-coupe">Mustangs</a> were equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission and 2,743 were automatics. A total of 261 of these cars were exported.</p>
<p>These 7-UP Fox-body Mustangs were stuffed with the 5.0-liter V8 engines with electronic fuel injection and capable of 225-rear-wheel-horsepower. Those who wanted more oomph out of their 7-UP <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/happy-birthday-ford-mustang/">Mustang</a> could have an aftermarket supercharger installation by Steve Saleen. About a dozen cars took up the offer.</p>
