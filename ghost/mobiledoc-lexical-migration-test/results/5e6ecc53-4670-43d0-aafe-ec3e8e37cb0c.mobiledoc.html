<p>A local report details out how a rental 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-daytona-auction/">Dodge Charger</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-hellcat-thieves/">was stolen</a> recently. The car was parked at Enterprise Car Rental is Fenton, Missouri when sometime between 6 pm on January 4 and 6:30 am on January 5 it was stolen. Yet again we have an example of how the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/police-warning-dodge-thefts/">modern Mopar muscle cars</a>, those being the Dodge Challenger and Charger, are extremely tempting to the criminal element for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dodge-muscle-catnip-to-criminals/">reasons we’ve delved into before</a>.</p>
<p>This story gets even more interesting as the news report mentions there was an odd occurrence on January 4 before the car was stolen. An employee at Enterprise realized the keys for the Dodge Charger <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-target-dealership/">were missing</a>. Realizing the potential for the car to be swiped by whomever took the keys, she positioned a 2020 Hyundai Elantra to block it in. However, the strength of the Korean compact wasn’t enough to contain <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c7-corvette-z06-dodge-hellcat/">the might of the American sedan</a>, or something like that.</p>
<p>Whomever took the Charger obviously wasn’t deterred by the Elantra roadblock, but instead the Hyundai appeared to have sustained some front-end damage during the heist. We hear George Clooney is trying to secure the movie rights to this gripping tale, mostly because Hollywood is out of original ideas. It has promise to be more compelling than the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/worst-batmobile-yet/">new Batmobile revealed recently on Batwoman</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thieves realized the Mopar had an onboard GPS tracker from the factory, because police found the car dumped 3 days later in Centerville, Illinois. The report doesn’t say anything about the state of the Dodge, but it was returned to the Enterprise Car Rental and the damage wasn’t noted so it could be pinned on the next person to take it out while they’re on vacation. Of course that last part is completely made up, but you really should examine a rental car thoroughly before pulling out of the lot with it.</p>
<p>The local Sheriff’s office is interested in information anyone might have about this crime, so if you just so happen to know who did it you should give them a call.</p>
