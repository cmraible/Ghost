<p>Every car ad you read claims “one-of-one” but, like any other desirable identifier in the car world, “one-of-one” has been co-opted by marketers to describe cars that are anything but. They may make the claim based on some obscure reason- the only one with orange stitching on the seatbelts with blue interior, perhaps. When we talk about this 1967 Dodge Coronet R/T Convertible, we mean it is THE ONLY ONE sold new in the U.S. in this drivetrain combination. “Go find another one” would send you on a never-ending wild goose chase.</p>

<p>Imagine finding your dream car when it was considered "just a used car". That is precisely what the current owner if this original, factory documented 4spd, HEMI Superbird did when he purchased it in 1982 from the original owner. This was ordered new in Texas as a Chrysler Executive car. When the executive received a new car in 1971, Chrysler made the car available through the Race Car Driver's Program. As prices for genuine 4-speed manual shift HEMI Superbirds have climbed into the stratosphere, it is rare to find one that is still driven and enjoyed every car show season.</p>
