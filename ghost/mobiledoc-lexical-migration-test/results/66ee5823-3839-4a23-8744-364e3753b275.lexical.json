While Bundy didn’t drive a car model commonly used by law enforcement, many of these guys do, but sometimes we see ones who don’t and act like they’re deep undercover. Sadly, some people fall for the ruse. If you’re pulled over by someone you don’t think is a real cop, call 911. Dispatchers will gladly confirm if the person is actually law enforcement or not.",
