<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nhr/">Home bound</a> as are most of us, motoring journalist and bon vivant, Andy Reid contemplated boredom. Social isolation prevented him from accessing his project MGB-GT. Writing deadlines had been "mostly" met. He hatched an idea; it gelled after conversations with <a href="https://www.ameliaconcours.org/news.aspx">Amelia Island Concours </a>chair-Bill Warner and David Lillywhite, known for his roles at Octane, Petrolicious, and now <a href="https://www.magnetomagazine.com/">Magneto </a>magazine. Every automotive enthusiast and maybe everyone else has at least one car model on his/her desk, shelf, playroom floor or garage work table. There must be many; Hot Wheels had celebrated there fiftieth anniversary with their six billionth car.* </p>
<p>Reid and his friends launched the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Isolationislandheadjudge/">Isolation Concours </a>on March 31 on Facebook. Post 4-6 pictures of your car; share a description, justification, or a fabulous lie. The entry fee is appropriately a "donation to a community food bank or first responders charity in your area", posting its name but not the amount.</p>

<p>Classes follow the article. Entrants thus far have resumes as impressive as the judging team. Phil Neff, Chief Judge at the Greenbrier Conocurs, entered Jungle Jim Liberman's 1973 Vega Funny Car. "Although he only won one NHRA national event, Liberman was voted the #1 Funny Car driver of all time... the only good looking Chevy Vega ever!"</p>
