<p>Good things are happening! Sure, between the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the accelerating climate crisis, and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the world is on edge. But we at <em>The Daily Poster</em> have compiled several positive recent stories to suggest that hope is not lost.</p>
<p>First, President Joe Biden passed over potential Supreme Court justice frontrunner Judge Michelle Childs, a union buster propped up by Lindsey Graham, and instead nominated Judge Kentaji Brown Jackson, a former public defender whose recent court history suggests she could be a bit more welcoming to labor efforts. On top of that, despite the risks, dissident voices in Russia are speaking out against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion. Finally, a California union just scored a major win for ice cream cake makers. Victory has never tasted so sweet.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s week’s edition of You Love To See It, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="so-long-michelle-childs">So Long, Michelle Childs</h3>
<p>Judge Michelle Childs, of the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, has been passed over for the Supreme Court. Biden had pledged to name the first Black woman to the bench after Justice Stephen Breyer announced his upcoming retirement. Childs was a top contender, boasting the support of both Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/us/politics/michelle-childs-clyburn-supreme-court.html">Rep. Jim Clyburn</a> (D-S.C.). But progressive activists and labor unions urged the administration to find another judge given Childs’ record as a <a href="https://prospect.org/justice/clyburn-pushes-management-side-labor-attorney-for-supreme-court/">management-side labor attorney</a> with a history of <a href="https://prospect.org/justice/michelle-childs-punitive-criminal-justice-rulings-repeatedly-overturned/">punitive criminal justice rulings</a>.</p>
<p>Graham, who had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/13/supreme-court-gop-senator-says-michelle-childs-would-get-60-votes.html">predicted</a> that Childs would get more than 10 Republican votes, was none too pleased with the news that Biden was going in a different direction. On Friday, the senator <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1497218172071645195?s=20&t=jDAg93armGzC3TtEIsfjnw">took to Twitter</a> to bemoan the defeat of his preferred judge, writing that “the attacks by the Left on Judge Childs from South Carolina apparently worked” and noting, “the Harvard-Yale train to the Supreme Court continues to run unabated.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Biden instead announced he was nominating Judge Kentaji Brown Jackson of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to replace Breyer.</p>
<p>Brown, a former public defender, could prove to be a better choice. Earlier this month, in her first appeals court ruling, Brown sided with public sector unions against the Federal Labor Relations Authority when the agency tried to heighten bargaining requirements for public-sector workers. And while Jackson has also <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/op-ed-shoots-down-criticism-of-ketanji-brown-jackson-for-ruling-against-class-of-black-workers">come under fire</a> for refusing to certify a 2017 class action lawsuit filed by thousands of Black employees against Lockheed Martin for discrimination, her overall work history pleases many progressives. Congressional candidate and former Bernie Sanders surrogate Nina Turner, for example, has <a href="https://twitter.com/ninaturner/status/1497240809070108693?s=21">endorsed</a> Jackson’s nomination.</p>

<h3 id="solidarity">Solidarity</h3>
<p>As Russia invades Ukraine, thousands of antiwar protesters have taken to the streets in cities like <a href="https://twitter.com/mjluxmoore/status/1496906522080731139?s=20&t=wOjPHMblCT2Lahup4nBZrQ">Moscow</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1496905869983768581?s=20&t=wOjPHMblCT2Lahup4nBZrQ">St. Petersburg</a>. Despite the threat of state violence, the demonstrators are making their voices heard in their home country and across the world. Solidarity!</p>
<h3 id="organizing-works">Organizing Works</h3>
<p>Workers at the Jon Donaire Desserts plant in Santa Fe Springs, California, have <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1496946065689350171?s=20&t=wOjPHMblCT2Lahup4nBZrQ">prevailed</a> after a 113-day strike, securing a $3.10 wage increase over four years and blocking a plan to cut their health care benefits. More than 150 workers, who make ice cream cakes for companies like Baskin Robbins, Cold Stone Creamery, Walmart, Red Robin, and Safeway, had gone on strike in early November, demanding a $1 raise every year for three years and no healthcare cost increases.</p>
<p>Plant owner Rich Products Corporation, which reported more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/rich-products/?sh=1ab76bc87ccd">$4 billion in revenue</a> in the first year of the pandemic, relented this week. In response, Miguel Perez, who has worked at the plant for more than a decade, told More Perfect Union that the workers would be going back to work “with our heads held high” and that they “feel great.”</p>
<h3 id="americans-don%E2%80%99t-like-banning-books">Americans Don’t Like Banning Books</h3>
<p>Right-wing groups across the country have been trying to use critical race theory to rile up parents and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/the-conservative-school-board-strategy.html">take over school boards and state governments</a>. A recent report from the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/02/05/maus-beloved-banned-book-student/6668059001/?gnt-cfr=1">American Library Association</a> found that there were 330 attempts to ban books across the country last fall, representing a significant increase from recent years.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-bans-opinion-poll-2022-02-22/">recent poll</a> suggests that the right is losing this culture war. A new CBS-YouGov survey found that 85 percent of Americans do not support banning books from schools that contain political ideas they disagree with, 87 percent do not support banning books that discuss race or slavery, and 83 percent do not support banning books that criticize people or events in U.S. history.</p>

<h3 id="dakota-access-legal-battle-ends-in-pipeline-loss">Dakota Access Legal Battle Ends In Pipeline Loss</h3>
<p>After six long years, the legal battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline is over. The Supreme Court <a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2022/u-s-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-case-on-dakota-access-pipeline">declined to take up an appeal by Energy Transfer</a>, the operator of the pipeline, after a lower court handed a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux and other North Dakota tribes.</p>
<p>The ruling, which will now stand, invalidated a key federal permit for the pipeline on the grounds that it violated the National Environmental Policy Act. The court required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a comprehensive environmental review of the pipeline’s route underneath Lake Oahe, on the border of North and South Dakota, which Indigenous communities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/us-supreme-court-dakota-access-pipeline">consider sacred and have historically relied on</a>. Although the court battle was won, however, the <a href="https://twitter.com/JanHasselman/status/1496162336088158210?s=20&t=gZG7-Ii398df6Xn3OdZ_4Q">war of the pipeline’s fate continues</a>. The pipeline has been operating since 2017 and will continue to do so while the environmental review is completed.</p>
<h3 id="nlrb-tells-starbucks-to-kick-rocks">NLRB Tells Starbucks to Kick Rocks</h3>
<p>Starbucks baristas are unionizing. Workers at several stories in upstate New York have petitioned for union elections, following the lead of their colleagues in the Buffalo area. But the company has been trying to slow the elections, asking the National Labor Relations Board not to move forward with voting on the grounds that all stores in the region should vote together in one election. Unfortunately for the company, its attorneys missed a crucial deadline with the NLRB after they failed to turn in all of their paperwork on time. The company missed the cutoff just eight minutes.</p>
<p>As a result of the missed deadline, the NLRB’s regional director <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/starbucks-tries-to-delay-union-elections-but-misses-legal-deadline-by-8-minutes_n_62104854e4b0f2c343f48992?1agq">ordered</a> that the company was precluded “from litigating any of the issues raised in its untimely Submission,” despite the company’s attorneys arguing the union, Workers United, “suffered no prejudice” from the delay. The company can appeal the regional director’s order in Washington.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, labor committee chairs from <a href="https://twitter.com/TerriGerstein/status/1496853554333732865">17 states and D.C.</a> sent a letter to Starbucks’ CEO on Wednesday in support of the Starbucks Workers United union, urging the company to “follow the letter and spirit of the law by allowing your employees free choice in joining a union.”</p>
<h3 id="former-education-secretary-demands-biden-cancels-student-debt">Former Education Secretary Demands Biden Cancels Student Debt</h3>
<p>John King, who served as Barack Obama’s Secretary of Education, penned an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-cancel-student-debt-former-us-secretary-education-2022-2">op-ed</a> in <em>Insider </em>arguing that President Joe Biden should use his executive authority to unilaterally cancel student borrowers’ debt.</p>
<p>“Today, 42 million Americans hold over $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt,” Brown wrote. “All too often, the crushing weight of student debt prevents people from even considering buying a home, beginning a family, or starting a new business. This is indisputably a crisis.”</p>
<p>The former secretary pointed out that he was still paying off student loans while serving in the Obama administration. On Twitter, Brown <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnBKing/status/1496540787965931529?s=20&t=UMZQC8qMDZrE0MWttEAEgw">said</a> he was proud to be the first education secretary to call on a president to take such action.</p>

<h3 id="accountability-by-kaepernick">Accountability By Kaepernick</h3>
<p>Know Your Rights Camp, a group founded by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/us/colin-kaepernick-police-autopsy.html">providing</a> free second autopsies for families of people killed in circumstances involving police. The group will provide second opinions that have been previously widely unavailable due to high costs. Families often have to rely on the work of the local medical examiner or coroner, opening the door for individual biases to impact the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="nature%E2%80%99s-backup">Nature’s Backup</h3>
<p>Scientists <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-16/scientists-discover-deep-ocean-creatures-that-may-help-combat-climate-change">recently made groundbreaking discoveries</a> while studying sea beds that could prove useful in the fight against climate change. Researchers found that sea beds are host to far greater biodiversity than the oceans above them with many unknown lifeforms. Among the organisms found were plankton that fall to the seafloor and sequester carbon for millions of years. According to the paper published by the researchers, the findings “highlight previously underappreciated taxa that may be keystone drivers of the biological carbon pump.”</p>
