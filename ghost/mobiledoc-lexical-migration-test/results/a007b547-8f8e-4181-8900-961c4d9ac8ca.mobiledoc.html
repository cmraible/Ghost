<p>On my morning commute, I catch up with my podcasts. And, on this morning’s commute, I caught up with <a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2007/01/12/strange_attractor_podcast_iii_web_20_myths_blog_fuckwittery_and_twitter.php">the latest Strange Attractor podcast</a>, which had been sat on my iPod for a little while without me noticing. And, my goodness, what a corker. It’s not often you catch me laughing out loud as I drive the Croydon flyover, but I did this morning. The pair’s evisceration of both **<a href="http://indyblogs.typepad.com/independent/">The Independent’s “blogs”</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/columnists/columnists.html?in_article_id=427181&in_page_id=1772&in_author_id=255&expand=true#StartComments">Keith Waterhouse’s laughable opinion piece</a> in the <em>Daily <strike>Hate</strike> Mail</em> is just perfect.</p>
<p>And I strongly suggest my blogging journalist colleagues have a listen to it, just in case they feel the temptation to write “What do you think?” at the end of their posts…</p>
<p>As the podcast is hosted on Odeo, I can embed it here for your listening pleasure:</p>
