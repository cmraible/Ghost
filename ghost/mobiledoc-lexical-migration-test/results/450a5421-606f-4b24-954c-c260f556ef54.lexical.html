<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p>The combat is fluid with a healthy dose of RPG-esque customisation variety to go along with it. Your primary use of combat is the ZL & ZR triggers, which can be mapped as either melee or ranged to your liking. For upgrades, you'll come across <u><strong>CHIPS</strong></u> which you can equip for stat boosts <u><strong>and abilities</strong></u>. However, you can't go adding these willy-nilly as you also need to unlock <u><strong>chip slots</strong></u> which is done by purchasing them with the in-game currency, <u><strong>BOLTS</strong></u>. <br>In addition, you can purchase blueprints for new weapons and chips and craft them with the materials you gather throughout your adventure. This system is quite robust and offers plenty of customisation and experimentation.</p>
<p>Coupling crisp pixel art with low use of shading creates cutscenes which are mesmerising to look at. In addition to its dim cyberpunk setting, its use of colour and attention to detail with its animation results in a beautiful visual presentation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Fluid combat</li>
    <li>Robust customisation system</li>
    <li>Crisp pixel art</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p>The whole your character wakes up with amnesia trope has become quite tiresome, especially in video games<em></em>and it feels very played out here in <em>Unsighted</em>. Not only that, you are also tasked with collecting <u><strong>five crystals</strong></u> in order to create a weapon to defeat the evil... gee, I've never heard that one before (SARCASM DETECTED). </p>
<p>For me personally, the construct that each character has a limited amount of time gave me nothing but anxiety. This is very much a subjective complaint as the sense of urgency could greatly enhance the experience - especially when you consider the idea of growing attachments to characters vs the bonuses you get from them - but I couldn't help shake the nervousness that came with monitoring my time spent in each dungeon and wanting to take in the world at my own pace. It's very much a <em>Majora's Mask</em>-esque dilemma and will leave players divided. I like to keep my reviews as objective as I can but this concept soured my personal experience with <em>Unsighted</em>. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Clich√© plot</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-score-910">Final Score: 9/10</h2>
<p>If you can get past the trope-riddled plot, <em>Unsighted</em> is an indie gem alongside the likes of <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>and <em>CrossCode</em>.</p>
