I don’t know which is worse, driving a stock 1980s Dodge Caravan or this… thing. According to him, cutting off the roof is the first step towards making the minivan more exciting. Then he adds a rollbar (safety first, kids!) and lifts the thing, adding big mud tires. The entire time I kept waiting for Foose to yell out something about how he was just joking or something like that, but it never happened. And that’s it, that’s the video."
