<p>A <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29823">new study</a> finds that the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) — monthly cash payments to families — implemented last year did not negatively impact employment among adults with children. The data show that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was completely wrong about the federal benefit’s impact on workforce numbers.</p>
<p>Last October, Sen. Manchin <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html">tried to water down</a> President Biden’s enhanced CTC, urging a strict work requirement and a family income cap of $60,000 — a proposal that would have kicked more than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/manchin-could-prevent-37-million-kids-from-getting-child-tax-credit.html">37 million children</a> off of the expanded benefit, including 190,000 in his home state alone. Manchin’s efforts were pinned on his ill-informed theory that expanding the payments would lead to fewer people wanting to work.</p>
<p>But the new paper, published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, reveals “that the CTC expansion had no meaningful impact on employment and labor force participation after six months of benefit distribution.” Moreover, according to the study’s authors, “the CTC expansion had no significant effect on employment and labor force participation for the lowest-income groups, which benefited most from the CTC expansion.”</p>
<p>Importantly, the study does reiterate earlier findings that the expanded CTC “strongly reduced child poverty” and “strongly reduced food insufficiency,” ultimately leading to “improved well-being for families with children.” According to Columbia University's Center on Poverty and Social Policy, nearly <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/child-tax-credit-biden-asks-congress-to-extend-payments-what-that-means-for-you/">3.7 million children</a> fell into poverty in January after Congress allowed the expanded credit to expire.</p>
<p>Congress failed to extend the CTC past December, in part due to Manchin’s callous rhetoric, which included <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-joe-manchin-suggests-child-tax-credit-payments/story?id=81865740">questioning</a> whether parents would use CTC payments to buy drugs. In fact, a Bureau of Labor Statistics report found that the number of people with jobs actually increased <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-manchin-worried-child-tax-credit-would-lead-smaller-workforce-job-numbers-rose-1669538">1.5 percent</a> after receiving the credit.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyzenkus/status/1501339624471289857?t=lyeCu2eiFEQx1DA3BZViwg&s=19">According to</a> Anthony Zenkus, a professor at Columbia University’s School of Social Work, “The United States has been at war for 225 of the 246 years it's been in existence.” That means the country has been at war for more than 90 percent of the time it’s been a nation, noted Zenkus, adding, “ No other nation on earth comes close. It's basically all we do.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, people around the world observed International Women’s Day, a celebration adopted by the West in 1975. The day was <a href="https://www.messynessychic.com/2017/03/10/the-soviet-communist-origins-of-international-womens-day/">established</a> by the USSR in 1917 as International Working Women’s Day. The U.S. <a href="https://twitter.com/mokawima/status/1501244263685836814?t=ZnHW2_UYr-1R5ty2GjmdQg&s=19">dropped</a> the word “working” from their version.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>“TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT”</strong>: The Internal Revenue Service — the agency responsible for policing tax crime — audited Americans earning less than $25,000 at five times the rate of everyone else, according to <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/tracirs/latest/679/">new findings</a> from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. “Does it make sense from either an equity or revenue standpoint to focus IRS’s limited firepower on the poorest taxpayers among us — those with incomes so low they have filed returns claiming an anti-poverty earned income tax credit?” the report asked. Last year, <em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-tax-war-in-one-chart/">reported</a></em> that the IRS’s budget has steeply declined as a percentage of the economy’s overall size, and that the agency’s audits of the wealthiest Americans have fallen dramatically and disproportionately.</p>
<p><strong>POLITICIANS BOUGHT ENERGY STOCKS AHEAD OF UKRAINE INVASION: </strong>A new <a href="https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1501266170371993600?t=P7ML8m8db1sLgerX5rmWbQ&s=19">report</a> from unusualwhales.com finds that several U.S. lawmakers who serve on committees privy to private information — including Defense and Energy — recently bought energy stocks for the first time. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) <a href="https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1501266172507009036?t=lRUSIgXfbjCZJr4KvspEiA&s=19">bought</a> American oil stocks, war stocks, and renewable energy stocks one day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, at the same time <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1496490950444597250?t=as_LM9LKG8dzUNGDc5mIgg&s=19">tweeting</a> about how “War and rumors of war is incredibly profitable and convenient.” In response to the news of MTG buying stock in Lockheed Martin — the nation’s largest defense contractor — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1501042729001922561?t=zzSZnnUksTGMxszzZnWEqw&s=19">tweeted</a> that there will soon be a hearing on banning federal lawmakers from trading stock in office.</p>
<p><strong>TAX JUSTICE ORGS URGE MORE FEDERAL FUNDING TO ENFORCE SANCTIONS: </strong>On Tuesday, the Financial Accountability & Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition — a nonpartisan alliance of more than 100 organizations working toward a fair tax system — issued a <a href="http://salsa4.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=yJhRFTW9t2qZ5Jb5xgNAQp76HAS8kaij">press release</a> urging Congress to greenlight $118 million in funding for the Treasury Department to effectively enforce U.S. sanctions on Russian oligarchs. Last Spring, President Biden submitted as part of his FY 2022 budget request nearly $75 million in funding for the Treasury Department to carry out rulemaking efforts aimed at combating money laundering — a proposal that was met with <a href="http://salsa4.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=%2FbHBmZP2GDNH3IoTF8ER7576HAS8kaij">lawmakers’ calls</a> to further boost funding for this purpose. “If political leaders who say they want to catch oligarchs’ yachts are serious, now is the time to put their money where their mouth is,” said Erica Hanichak, FACT’s government affairs director. “This is an unprecedented opportunity to rein in the financial corruption that supports Russia’s war.”</p>
<p><strong>IT’S ALL A GAME TO THEM: </strong>On Tuesday, Paul Begala, a former top advisor to President Bill Clinton, teamed up with Reince Preibus, former President Donald Trump’s chief of staff, for a <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewperezdc/status/1500960987054280716?t=HdnFKknqCBG_saeqWzEDfg&s=19">special pundit debate show</a> at the 2022 conference of the Federation of American Hospitals — a lobbying group representing pricy investor-owned hospital chains. Moderating the panel was Chip Kahn, the federation’s CEO and a key architect in the plot to nix health care reform under Clinton. Kahn reportedly created the “Harry and Louise” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOX2P4s-Iw">ad series</a> warning about the pitfalls of government-run health care. More recently, Kahn has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2019/11/25/medicare-for-all-lobbying-072110">taken credit for</a> forming the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, the front group campaigning against Medicare for All and a public health insurance option.</p>
<p><strong>AMAZON RAINFOREST’S WANING RESILIENCE IS IMPACTING CLIMATE CHANGE: </strong>New research shows that the Amazon is increasingly struggling to recover from droughts, deforestation, and other changes, which could transform more of the world’s largest rainforest into grassland and significantly impact climate change. “Losing the rainforest could result in up to 90 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide getting put back into the atmosphere, equivalent to several years of global emissions,” according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/climate/amazon-rainforest-climate-change-deforestation.html">recent reporting</a> from <em>The New York Times</em>. Scientists advocate for an end to deforestation in order to save the Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>PROFIT-DRIVEN PHYSICIAN MANAGEMENT HIKED ANESTHESIOLOGY COSTS: </strong>According to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2789280?resultClick=1">new study</a>, anesthesiology costs substantially rose after hospitals contracted with private equity-backed physician management companies. Moreover, the paper — published last month in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> — revealed that the growing trend of outsourcing anesthesiology management to profit-driven firms can hurt patients in the form of increased premiums and copays, and the moves don’t necessarily benefit physicians either. “Many states have corporate-practice-of-medicine laws that theoretically ban non-physician corporations from employing physicians, but these laws are easily circumvented,” Lawrence Casalino, one of the researchers, <a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2022/02/study-shows-anesthesia-costs-rise-with-corporate-outsourcing">explained</a>. “It may be time to reevaluate and either eliminate or strengthen them.”</p>
