While there aren’t too many Trail Dusters left, which was Plymouth’s own spin on the Ramcharger offered from 1974 to 1980, it’s great to see a Hellcat dropped into something other than a classic Charger or Challenger."

Among the upgrades is a custom-fabricated exhaust system, NAG1 5-speed automatic transmission with rotary controller, large radiator/transmission cooler/supercharger intercooler/AC condenser, Dyantrac axles, and an Atlas transfer case. The shop even used a fresh spray of Canyon Red to really make this off-roader pop."

As sad as that is, we’re glad this one is getting some loving as well as wicked engine swap. That hopefully means it will be cherished for many more decades instead of being sent to the scrap heap."
