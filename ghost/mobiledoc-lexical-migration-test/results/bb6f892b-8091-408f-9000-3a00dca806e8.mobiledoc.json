This truck is unique in that it was built by Ford for the SAE Conference and later used for internal reviews and environmental testing by Ford before being sold to its first and current owner with 643 miles. The flareside 4x4 Ranger has racked up many more miles since then as it has just 5,270 miles on it today, and it is the most customized vehicle on this list with a bug deflector, side steps and body-colored tonneau cover with a spoiler. This Autum Orange Metallic 1998 Ford Ranger is being sold for $20,900."

Not only did the 1997 model year mark the end of the line for Porsche's air-cooled 911, the 993 generation was sent off with a powerful Turbo S model that was limited to just 183 units built. On top of that one-two punch of rarity, this one survives today with just 1,416 actual miles! No price was listed, but you can click "
