<p>The engine bay on this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=chevrolet+silverado">Chevy Silverado</a> is another work of art. It’s in excellent condition, clean, and tidy. The heart and soul of this truck is a 5.3-liter engine with forged internals and Texas Speed Stage 4 cams. The full motor was professionally built by a highly reputable performance shop. It’s mated to a built 4L80E transmission with a 3,200 rpm stall converter. If that wasn’t enough, this show-quality truck also received an LSA supercharger. That powerhouse combination results in a whopping 597 rwhp. This truck was professionally tuned as well and is ready to go.</p>
<p>This is a one-of-a-kind turn-key show truck that could run with some of the fastest cars on the street. Best believe that no expense was spared in building this truck. The current asking price is set at $19,900, and you can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/172218/2001-chevrolet-silverado">make an offer</a> right here.</p>
