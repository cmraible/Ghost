<h3 id="see-the-sights-and-sounds-of-new-york-city-in-a-whole-new-way">See the sights and sounds of New York City in a whole new way.</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a unique way to see the sights and sounds of New York City, a new service called <a href="https://www.nowaday.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Nowaday</a> will give you an hour-long tour in fashion... vintage fashion. Although NYC already offers tours that include double-decker buses and Segways, Nowaday is a more unique way of touring the city as you're driven around a designated route in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/highlights/">pre-war</a> cars.</p>

<p>This service just launched in November, and it was created by two women – co-founders Jaime Getto and Heather Stupi – looking to offer a different way to tour New York. Currently, there is just one tour route that begins at the base of Central Park and then continues past landmarks such as Columbus Circle, Carnegie Hall, Times Square, Bryant Park, the New York Public Library, the Flatiron building, Grand Central and The Plaza. The tour lasts about an hour, and it costs just $49 per person.</p>
<p>Nowaday has a fleet of a dozen restored vintage cars that include '28, '32 and '34 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/Model%20B" rel="nofollow">Fords</a> as well as a 1932 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chrysler/Imperial" rel="nofollow">Chrysler Imperial</a> and a 1931 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet</a> Independence. These cars were specifically chosen for the NYC tour to visit buildings built around the turn of the century in cars from the same era. To handle the rigorous duties of touring New York City, these cars have been restored and upgraded with air conditioning, heat and seat belts. The tour even provides attire, props and memorabilia from the '20s to complete the experience!</p>

<p>In the future, Nowaday plans to expand to other tourist cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris and London, and each city would use region-specific vintage cars in order to match the surrounding architecture. Tours can be booked directly through the Nowaday website or on travel sites such as Airbnb and TripAdvisor.</p>
