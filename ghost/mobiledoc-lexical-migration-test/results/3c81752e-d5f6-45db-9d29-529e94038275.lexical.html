<p>In The Messenger, each Phobekin is in need of your help. When you find and save all four, you will be able to progress through to the final levels, but where are they? Well, we’ve got your back with a full guide on where to find each one…</p>
<h2>Phobekin #1</h2>
<p>The first little creature you will encounter before the game switches to a Metroidvania, in the second level just as you enter the Catacombs. In here, you’ll meet Necro.</p>

<p>so we can check that one off of the list.</p>
<h2>Phobekin #2</h2>
<p>The Prophet’s hint for the second little creature is as follows:</p>
<p>“<strong>WHERE THE DEAD LIVE</strong>, A FOE TURNED FRIEND LEFT AN IMPORTANT ITEM”</p>
<p>If you pay gold for a hint, the shopkeep will say that you need to go to Catacombs, on the far right (second square from the right).</p>

<p>The door will open to reveal Ruxxtin’s final resting place along with a note:</p>
<p>Dear Messenger,</p>
<p><em>“If you’re reading this, it means what my research indicated is true and you travelled 500 years into the future. I meant it when I said I was done being evil, I even planned for my relics to come to your aid. First is my Amulet, yours to keep and remember me by. I also left my staff at the top of <strong>Glacial Peak</strong>. It will answer to you as long as you carry my Amulet. Also, I did some digging around the <strong>Catacombs</strong> and I believe I found a secret entrance to a <strong>new area you should explore</strong>, though it was very dark. Look for the secret passage in the room with two bats and a moving platform. Best of luck on your quest. Ruxxtin.”</em></p>
<p>After reading this note, you’ll receive Ruxxtin’s Amulet which will activate the Necromancer’s Staff. It was stated that it was in Glacial Peak, so that’s where we’ll go…</p>
<p>Head left one square to the shop, then left again all the way to Tower of Time HQ. Go through the portal on the right and arrive in Glacial Peak. Now head up to this frame…</p>

<p>Then go down a frame and go through the portal to make the level 8 bit. Once you’ve done that, go up and right and do a leap of faith to the right, glide and go through the little opening there.</p>

<p>Now make your way through this challenging but linear section to the next area. But hold on, he’s not there… but he’s a fear-stricken one who is cowering down below. Make your way all the way down and speak to Claustro.</p>

<p>This hint requires you to go to Searing Crags. Take the fifth portal there and it’s basically two frames over.

<p>You clearly need to get over to the “little creature paralyzed by fear”, but there’s lava in the way… For this, you’ll need the Lightfoot Tabi item which allows you to run on water (or in this case, lava). <a href="https://switchaboo.com/2018/09/05/the-messenger-magic-seashell-underwater-maze-sunken-shrine-key-of-love-walkthrough-with-images/">If you haven’t got that item yet, then you will need to do this section first.</a></p>
<p>Once you have the Lightfoot Tabi, you can run across the lava and talk to the little guy.</p>
