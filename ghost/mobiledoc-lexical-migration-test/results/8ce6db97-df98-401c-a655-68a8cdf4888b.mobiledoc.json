Using heavy-duty rubber tracks, it can roll through all kinds of terrain at what looks to be pretty decent speeds. We’re not sure if it does tank turns or not, but in one of the included videos you can see one make some pretty tight turns, which can really come in handy on a trail."

There’s seating for 4 people, an oddity for these things, with only 6 such examples built so far."

For someone who is into off-roading and already has more traditional rigs, this could be a fun new toy. The asking price is listed at $575,000 with the highest bid at the time this article was written being $525,000. A good number of people are watching the post, so if you’re serious about bidding on this machine you should expect some competition, especially at the last minute."
