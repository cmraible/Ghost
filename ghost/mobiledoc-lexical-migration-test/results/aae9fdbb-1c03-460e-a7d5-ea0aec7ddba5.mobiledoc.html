<p>There's a lot of troubling news out there — but today, I've got a bit of fun news to share: You can now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL9aJcqrtnw">watch the first trailer</a> of the upcoming blockbuster film <em>Don't Look Up</em>, which I've been working on with director Adam McKay for more than a year.</p>
<p>The film will be in select theaters on December 10 and arrives December 24 on Netflix. Here’s how <a href="https://ew.com/movies/dont-look-up-first-look-photos-teaser-trailer/">Entertainment Weekly described it in its new piece this week</a>:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://ew.com/tag/jennifer-lawrence/"><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a><strong> and</strong><a href="https://ew.com/tag/leonardo-dicaprio/"><strong> Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a><strong> play a pair of astronomers, Kate Dibiasky and Dr. Randall Mindy, attempting to warn the world about the apocalyptic threat presented by an approaching comet… DiCaprio tells EW, "Adam has an unparalleled ability to spark conversation with humor and timely stories. I knew when I read his script that it was incredibly unique, as it struck an important chord concerning the modern world we live in. Adam has woven an incredibly timely message about society, how we communicate, our current priorities, and the climate crisis into an absurdly funny yet important movie."</strong></blockquote>
<p>The film also stars Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, Tyler Perry, Rob Morgan, Mark Rylance, Ron Perlman, Timothée Chalamet, and Ariana Grande. You can check out <a href="https://ew.com/movies/dont-look-up-first-look-photos-teaser-trailer/">photos from the movie here</a>. And also, make sure to watch the trailer here:</p>

<p><br>I’m really proud that I helped develop the story for the film and co-produced it. On a personal level, it’s totally surreal to see an idea become a huge blockbuster film <strong>—</strong> and one that’s both hilarious and really important. Here's what McKay recently said about the film in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/12/magazine/adam-mckay-interview.html"><em>New York Times</em> Q&A</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>It’s not the most high-concept bizarre idea — the idea of a disaster movie in which people don’t necessarily believe that the disaster is coming. It goes back to the trope of the mayor from "<em>Jaws"</em>: “Love to prove that, wouldn’t you? Get your name into the National Geographic?” That’s a line the dismissive mayor of Amity Island says in response to warnings from the oceanographer Matt Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss, that a big shark is out there ready and waiting to gobble up the town’s beachgoers. So it’s two midlevel, very sincere astronomers who make the discovery of a lifetime, which is a killer asteroid headed toward Earth. They have to warn everyone and have to go on a media tour. It’s them navigating our world. It’s them navigating their equivalent of Twitter. It’s them navigating the political landscape. It’s them navigating talk shows and how they’re perceived. It’s DiCaprio and Lawrence and Rob Morgan trying to warn the world. I call it a dark comedy...</strong></blockquote>
<p>Please share the trailer far and wide. I can't wait for you to see this movie when it comes out. Stay tuned!</p>
