The chase at that point, which had been going on for a while before, was taking place in northwest Miami-Dade County. Instead of letting some heavy traffic get in his way, the driver aggressively split lanes, passed on the shoulders, and unapologetically cut off other drivers. After all, he was driving the car like it was stolen."

But as the Mopar muscle car continued down the highway, it started to run into thicker traffic, making for even more close calls while at the same time forcing the driver to slow down some."

After coming to a section of heavy, stopped traffic, the car pulled over to the side of the road and just stopped. Then two guys got out of the Dodge and just stood on the sidewalk by it like they weren’t running from the cops. They even looked like they were having a conversation."
