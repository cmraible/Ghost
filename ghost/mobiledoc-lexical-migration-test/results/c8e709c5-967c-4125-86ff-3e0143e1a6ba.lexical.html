<p>There’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-baddest-chevelles/">serious following for the Chevelle</a>, a vehicle which for the GM faithful and even just the GM sympathetic is pretty much the pinnacle of what a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> can be. Many <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1969-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-crashed-recovered/">would gladly take just about any Chevelle</a> these days, considering how prices keep climbing, but for those who are serious about having a track-ready and show-winning vehicle, this ’67 Chevelle Malibu SS could be perfect.</p>

<p>It took five years and a lot of money to build this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1962-chevrolet-corvette-roadster-pro-touring/">pro touring car</a>. According to the seller, the process involved a nut-and-bolt restoration of everything from the ground up, so you shouldn’t find rust hiding in any nooks or crannies.</p>

<p>More importantly, under the hood is a GM ZZ 502ci V8 crate engine. Backing that is a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission. Enhancing the setup is a Holley carb, Vintage Air Front Runner driver system, Sanderson headers with a 3-inch exhaust with Spintec chambered mufflers, and custom high-performance radiator with two 3000 cfm fans.</p>

<p>This car was built to be driven, and with that in mind it has a Speed Tech <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/family-affair-pro-touring-69-gto/">Pro-Touring</a> Stage 3 suspension which includes fully-adjustable coilovers at all four corners. There’s also a 9-inch Quick Time Performance Positraction rear with 3.73 gears. A Wilwood four-wheel disc brake setup is also included.</p>

<p>As anyone can clearly see, this Chevelle has been built with beauty in mind as well. A breathtaking blue body, sparkling chrome, custom Boyds wheels, and smoothed door handles make quite the impression. That same level of beauty is on display under the hood, where polished and chromed parts abound.</p>

<p>Modern Cadillac bucket seats with leather upholstery, power windows, keyless entry, and navigation make the interior comfortable, even by today’s standards. The dash has been custom fabricated and features Classic Instruments gauges. A Flaming River tilt-adjustable steering column with custom leather-wrapped steering wheel add further to the unique feel. So you can show off everything, the trunk matches the interior of the car.</p>
