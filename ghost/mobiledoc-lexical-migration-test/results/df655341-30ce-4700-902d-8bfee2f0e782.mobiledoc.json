When it was used in production cars (1965-1971), this engine was rated with a net power output of 350 hp (and a gross rating of 425 hp), which is a big step up from this truck's high-output 360 cubic-inch V8 rated at 225 horsepower. There's no indication of this Hemi's current power with a fresh build, elect iconic ignition and electronic fuel injection. Power is sent to the rear tires through a Torqueflite automtiac transmission with a stall converter and a Mopar 9.25-inch rear end with 3.73 posi gears."
