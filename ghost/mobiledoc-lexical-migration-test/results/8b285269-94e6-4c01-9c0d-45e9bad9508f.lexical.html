<p>You might have noted a lack of long form stuff on here in recent weeks. That’s partially because it’s marking season and I’m very busy right now, and partially because I’ve actually been publishing some long form stuff elsewhere.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a long think piece for journalism.co.uk about the <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news-commentary/-we-haven-t-even-scratched-surface-of-explainer-journalism-/s6/a556585/">rise of explainer journalism</a>, why we’ll see more evergreen content, and the concept of stock and flow content.</p>
<p>It was a nice example of my teaching at City converging with my consultancy, and the need to start developing a vocabulary of terms to pass on those ideas to students and clients.</p>
<p>It was also <em>very</em> well received, with plenty of hot, hot Twitter action around it.</p>

<p>Earlier today, I wrote a follow-up, looking at <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news-commentary/the-three-stages-of-digital-transformation/s6/a556782/">the three stages of digital transformation</a> that traditional publishing businesses go through as they try to adapt to today’s online environment for journalism, in the light of the leaking of the New York Times innovation report.</p>
<p>I’d be very interested to hear what you think of them…</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
