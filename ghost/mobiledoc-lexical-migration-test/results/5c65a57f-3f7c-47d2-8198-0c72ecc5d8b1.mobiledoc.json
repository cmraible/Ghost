Set to take place this year from Thursday, September 1 through Monday, September 5 at The Harley-Davidson Museum and six dealerships in the area, it promises to provide a little bit of something for everyone. While there will be plenty of bike-related activities, if your significant other is more interested in live music, food, and vendors, those are all part of the mix."

You’ll find bikes, bikes, and more bikes at each location. Not only will motorcycles featuring designs from different fabricators and businesses be prominently displayed, a lot of attendees will of course arrive on their own ride. Its’ a great chance to see all kinds of customizations and even a few rare Harleys."
