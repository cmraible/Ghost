<p>Whether you're interested in installing a new VMP supercharger to boost you into better E.T. times at the drag strip or bolting on a set of brand new Carroll Shelby wheels wrapped with new BFGoodrich rubber, there is a little something for everyone. Making a donation to <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winperformanceprizes?promo=CRUISE2">Cruise for a Cause</a> will automatically enter you into the drawing for these ten prizes. Even better, each donation gives all proceeds to help with breast and prostate cancer research.</p>
<p><a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winperformanceprizes?promo=CRUISE2">Anybody in the</a> Mustang community, may have seen Dan Neve and his Mustangs (2010 Shelby GT5oo and a new Bullitt) at different automotive events across the country sporting breast cancer awareness livery. He usually has a setup with plenty of t-shirts for sale complete with the running pony logo wrapped with the pink breast cancer ribbon. The thing is, Dan has no paid employees, and he travels to all of these events to raise awareness while accepting funds to help with cancer research. </p>
<p>Cruise for a Cause <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winperformanceprizes?promo=CRUISE2">was started</a> by Dan Neve after his wife and mother were both diagnosed with breast cancer only a month apart from each other. While his family was battling with the disease, Dan knew he needed to help in some way for others who may be fighting or have loved ones also diagnosed with cancer. </p>
<p>Back in 2010, during the time that Dan's wife was in the process of multiple surgeries, he purchased a 2010 Shelby GT500 Mustang. <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winperformanceprizes?promo=CRUISE2">This new Mustang</a> was going to help him make a difference, and that's how Cruise for a Cause was born, a 501c 3 non-profit that supports the Marshfield Clinic Health Systems Research Foundation.</p>
<p>Asked to make a speech at a Susan G. Komen event, Dan was uncertain how to proceed. He remembered going to school with a girl that was diagnosed with polio, but today he doesn't know anyone who has the disease. He made a point to say that he hoped that we could all the say the same about cancer, especially our children or grandchildren.</p>
<p>If you donate to <a href="https://cruise4acause.tapkat.org/winperformanceprizes?promo=CRUISE2">Cruise for a Cause</a>, you are entered to win a few different prizes with every penny helping with cancer research. Also, if anybody donates $100 or more, a Cruise for a Cause t-shirt will be thrown in with sizes ranging from Large to X-Large offered in both men's and women's v-neck styles.</p>
<p>The closing date for the sweepstakes is on November 20th, 2020 at 2:00 p.m. CST. Drawings will be held the same day at 3:00 p.m. CST at Cruse 4 a Cause in Marshfield, Wisconsin. </p>
