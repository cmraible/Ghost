<p>One of the most lauded of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle cars</a> at a time <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-cuda/">when these powerful beasts ruled American roads</a>, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-oldsmobile-442-w-30/">1970 Oldsmobile 442</a> is impressive in any state. However, this one is all dressed up with Aegean Aqua Metallic and black stripes for a look <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/jaw-dropping-1970-chevelle-ss-454-is-ready-for-a-new-owner/">which will make jaws drop open</a> while eliciting all kinds of verbal excitements.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s more than just looks to be excited about with this Olds. It brings the heat with GM’s 455ci V8, the biggest and most powerful engine the brand offered, making a high point for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/abandoned-1957-oldsmobile-88-is-a-muscle-car-relic/">Oldsmobile</a> name. Hey, with the muscle car wars waging, you couldn’t bring a peashooter to a high-horsepower fight. This particular engine is advertised with 328-degree cams and a W-30 carburetor.</p>

<p>While some classic muscle cars are intimidating to modern drivers, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-oldsmobile-442-w-30/">Oldsmobile 442</a> is far more approachable. It has an automatic transmission, so there’s no wrestling with a monster clutch and manhandling a shifter constantly. Meanwhile, the twin scoop ram air hood looks cool, while there’s a “flapper door” air cleaner for making satisfying sounds when you drop the hammer.</p>

<p>There are even more cool details on this car. For example, the W-30 emblems are made of diecast. Red plastic fender walls are visible when you pop the hood to service the engine. The 15-inch wheels are wrapped with BFGoodrich Radial T/As which look new.</p>

<p>In the black interior, woodgrain accents on the door panels, dash, and center console warm things up considerably. The factory gauges and controls are joined by a couple of additional gauges attached under the center of the dash.</p>

<p>The Oldsmobile 442 is a legend in the industry, but it started out as a response to the mighty Pontiac GTO. Launched as a package for the F-85 and Cutlass in 1964, the name originally stood for a 4bbl carb, four-speed transmission, and dual exhaust system. In 1965 the significance of the name changed when Olds adopted a 400ci V8, making the 442 a hot muscle car. Thanks to surging sales, the 442 was made a standalone model in 1968, lasting through 1972.</p>
