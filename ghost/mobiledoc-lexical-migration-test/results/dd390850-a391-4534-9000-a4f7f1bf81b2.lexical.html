<p>It all started a few years ago when a Woodinville child took some pictures of his beloved wood model car. He could picture the vehicle in many different positions using perspective shots, making it look as realistic as possible. Although the car wasn't very realistic, the pictures came out incredibly well, which greatly satisfied the young photographer. Apparently, he didn't understand why anyone would be interested in his art until his mother began posting his pictures online. This started his path to a beautiful life of art and the pursuit of greatness in what he loves to do.</p>
