          " is a two-rotor rotary which is pretty great in terms of performance within the rotary community. It uses a two-rotor system for a lot of complicated engineering reasons but it was once essentially a stock RX-7 engine. This platform is known for its lack of torque but it doesn’t really seem to be an issue in this C5 Corvette. Rather, barreling down straights and tight turns you’ll notice this vehicle making a whopping 550 ft/lbs of torque."

Because of this, the leaf springs that originally came in the Corvette had to be yanked out and replaced with a set of coil overs. Adding to this beautiful insanity, a lot of work was done to make the T56 Magnum transmission fit in place of the stock example. Overall, it’s an incredible build that makes history with many car enthusiasts and even pays some tribute to the first rotary ‘Vette made in the 1960s."
