The free roaming even extends to combat where it gives each character a certain radius to move.

Beep-O, the gang's trusty Roomba pal, has the honour of being fully voice-acted, which is apt considering he drives much of the narrative and provides tutorial context. In addition, the main Rabbid characters also have voice-acting, but they're only graced with occasional quips within cutscenes and key moments of gameplay action. Unsurprisingly, the primary Mushroom Kingdom characters maintain their wahs and woohoos, provided by the ever-reliable Charles Martinet; I suppose Chris Pratt, Charlie Day and Anya Taylor-Joy were too busy working on the movie."

It's default setting had the camera movement to be painfully slow, so adjusting that in the settings was one of the first things I did, but overall, I found that it got stuck behind objects and terrain much too easily. You can press the R button and that will snap the camera back to behind the camera but at times, I found myself pining for the more fixed camera of the original, which just sounds like a contradiction based on how I praised the free roaming previously.

The main party tends to stick with quippy one-liners, and Rabbid Peach, with her teen-like phone obsession, tends to rely on current Gen-Z trends like \"Hashtag Winning\" and \"TikTok\". While I'm not going to go bashing Gen-Z trends here as we were (or are) all that age at one point in our life, but I feel as though having these quotes shoehorned in can result in the game feeling even more cringy and outdated in years to come. It's like if we looked back on a game from 6-8 years ago and they're making references to poking on Facebook; it ruins the evergreenness of the game and will ultimately be causes for further eye rolls by those who come back to the game when it's deemed retro."
