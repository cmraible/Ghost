According to the BMW M Registry, BMW only built of these 1,767 E24 M6 coupes for the North American market (and 1,632 for the U.S.) during the 1987 to 1989 model years, and this "

Opening the hood reveals the heart of the M6: BMW's 3.5-liter S38B35 inline-six that was derived from the M1, and it produced an impressive 256 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. This engine is backed by a Getrag five-speed manual gearbox and a limited slip differential."

The condition of the Silver Gray leather interior is also evidence of how pampered this car's life has been, and it blends its sporty and luxurious nature with heated and power-adjustable front seats."
