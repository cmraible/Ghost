<hr>
<p>It is completely possible that this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/double-green-double-headlights-1969-gmc-sierra-grande/">GMC</a> High Sierra started off as or at some point later on became a work truck but it sure doesn’t look like it. As it sits, <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11007819&avId=889799&pageID=4&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article3&utm_campaign=marchsale">this 4x4</a> is an unrestored true survivor in excellent condition inside and out. Being garage kept since new has kept the paint and bright-work shiny and clear and the underside free from rust. <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11007819&avId=889799&pageID=4&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article3&utm_campaign=marchsale">The truck's single owner</a> has managed to only put 98,000 miles on the clock while keeping up with all of the needed maintenance.</p>

<p>Under the hood sits a well-maintained 5.7-liter fuel injected V8 engine. Power is routed to the wheels via a manual transmission and the four-wheel-drive works as it is supposed to. The option list for this truck is very long and represents the best <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11007819&avId=889799&pageID=4&utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article3&utm_campaign=marchsale">GMC had to offer in 1987</a>. Power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, rear sliding window, and dual gas tanks are among this truck's best original options while a trailer hitch and a trailer brake controller were added. Protecting the truck’s bed from the usual dents and dings is a rubber mat that has likely been there since the truck was new.</p>

<p>With the exception of a single crack in the dash the interior is in incredible condition. The original door panels, headliner, carpet and dash all look great. As the only non-original part of the truck, the seat which features new cloth upholstery fits in surprisingly well. This is an awesome opportunity to get behind the wheel of this classic truck.
