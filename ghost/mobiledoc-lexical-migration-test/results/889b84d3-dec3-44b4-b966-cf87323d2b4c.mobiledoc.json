Other unique add-ons for this package include the heavy-duty suspension, larger radiator, boxed frame designed for the Chevelle convertible and the rear axle and brake setup from the bigger Impala. Aside from the \"396\" badges, the easiest way to spot the Z16 is the blacked-out rear trim piece between the taillights."

The level of detail and care is obvious with this car judging by the Regal Red paint job, black vinyl top, perfect chrome and the mag wheels and yellow line tires. To match the red exterior, this Chevelle has a red interior that is as clean as it was back in 1965, and the Z16s came fully loaded with features like power windows and tilt steering."
