          "Whatever you think of the original movie or its many sequels, it did help ignite interest in cars among some kids at the time, even if that interest was superficial. In the climax of the movie is illustrated the tension between fans of old-school American muscle cars and the young upstarts who firmly believed tuner Japanese cars would displace them. Much has changed since, with the franchise reflecting those shifts in the automotive landscape as American muscle has surged dramatically."

Sure, those two had been in other films, but they became cult heroes to the masses of rabid fans of the car-fueled franchise. Even though the street racing aspect of the franchise was left in the rearview mirror, each installment still gets butts in seats, unlike many Hollywood movies these days."
