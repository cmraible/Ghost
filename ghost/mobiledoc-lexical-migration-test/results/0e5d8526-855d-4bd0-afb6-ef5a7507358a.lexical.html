<p><em>I’m at WAN-IFRA’s <a href="https://events.wan-ifra.org/events/digital-media-europe-2017">Digital Media Europe conference</a> in Copenhagen for the next few days. This is the first of my liveblogged session notes from the event.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.zeit.de/index"><em>Die Zeit</em></a> has a 500,000 paid circulation as a weekly newspaper – and their weekly nature means that they lack many of the problems dailies have in balancing print and digital operations. Their circulation is 10% digital, and is growing 30% year on year. Online they reach 11.4m uniques per month.</p>
<p>35% of their audience in under 29 – higher than their competitors. It’s a stable figure – they’re young, but they want to get even younger. Why? Because you can’t just focus on today’s customers – you need to put effort into creating your future customers.</p>
<h3 id="four-strategic-aims">Four strategic aims</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Quality advertising of premium reach</strong> – display advertising isn’t dead – and as publisher we need to tell that story. Their business grew by 10% last year.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital circulation/paid content</strong> – they’ve sold through apps, but now they’re adding paid content on the websites.</li>
    <li><strong>Classified offerings</strong> – in niches (academic positions, top positions at NGOs)</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on millennials</strong> – you can’t look at the future without looking at your future readers.</li>
</ol>
<p>They’ve focused on mobile to reach millennials – and with mobile “cards” in particular – a design language that works for “flipping” behaviour for millennials. “We are not afraid of mobile”. Mobile display advertising is growing <em>strongly</em> for them.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/img_5857.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/img_5857.jpg?resize=960%2C680&ssl=1" alt loading="lazy"></a><br>Up until now <em>Die Zeit</em> has been sold as a single product, and <em>Zeit Online</em> was a separate thing – the print articles only hit the websites three or four weeks longer. They’ve now mixed the two in <a href="http://blog.zeit.de/fragen/2017/03/30/z-die-gedruckte-zeit-im-internet/">the Z+ product</a>.</p>
<p>Digital-only and digital-and -print bundles are growing strongly – app store revenue is pretty much flat.</p>
<h3 id="targeting-young-readers">Targeting young readers</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.zeit.de/campus/index"><em>Zeit Campus</em></a> – is a new editorial platform for students. It has a distinct design feel from the main part of <em>Zeit Online</em>, but it is still part of the wider product. Their first article – about ghostwriting of articles – went strongly viral. The key idea is <em>orientation</em> – helping students figure out what they want to <em>do</em> at university. They built an online tool to help people make those decisions.</p>
<p>They’re also reaching out to the younger demographic with events. event: <a href="http://www.zeit.de/z2x/">Z2X – the Festival of New Visionaries</a> in Berlin for 600 people. It’s not a one-off – they’re doing series of them.</p>
<p>And their launching niche sites. For example, <a href="http://ze.tt">ze.tt</a> – launched in July 2015 and run by a small, separate team, based in a loft in Berlin. It targets the 18 to 30 year old demographic. They run recruiting events called “work & play”. These are at least partially gamified, so rather than “speed dating” potential employers or employees, you play escape room games with them.</p>
<h3 id="key-lessons">Key lessons</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Find your own fundamental laws on display, mobile and homepage traffic.</li>
    <li>The homepage is <strong>not</strong> dead.</li>
    <li>Keep adding and expanding business models,</li>
    <li>Understand young readers</li>
    <li>Understand your market position. They <em>choose</em> to be premium.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>A couple of core points here:</p>
<h3 id="community-development">Community development</h3>
<p>The strategy for developing young, mobile readers is a classic community play:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify a target audience</li>
    <li>Identify content that they will find useful</li>
    <li>Develop that content</li>
    <li>Give them a sense of involvement through distinct branding</li>
    <li>Grow that out into events.</li>
</ul>
<p>That creates an emotional/intellectual double whammy that builds loyalty to your brand – and that loyalty is more likely to convert into paid subscriptions, if you can prove value.</p>
<h3 id="income-diversity">Income diversity</h3>
<p>Like many larger businesses, <em>Dei Zeit</em> is realising that there won’t be a single saviour business model that will enable transition to digital. A diverse range of business models targeting different sections of your audience is much more viable – and provides a greater safety net.</p>
<p>Nothing especially innovative in the ideas underlying the approaches shown here – but some good, thoughtful and sustainable execution.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
