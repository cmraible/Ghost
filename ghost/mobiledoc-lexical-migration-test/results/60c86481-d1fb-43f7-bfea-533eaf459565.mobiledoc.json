The video in question is taken in the incorrect and absolutely annoying portrait mode by someoneâ€™s phone at not a great resolution, so our apologies for the details not being entirely clear."

Even though the Mopar only has the wimpy V6 under the hood, that driver was likely pretty pissed his Mopar was abused by the Ford."

While some think there was no way the Dodge driver caught the other guy, we know for a fact itâ€™s not just the car that counts in these situations but driving skills as well. We already know the Ford driver isnâ€™t exactly some professional wheelman, however we doubt the abilities of anyone hanging out at a street takeover, so likely the Mopar driver isnâ€™t that great either."
