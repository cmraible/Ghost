          ". Despite that, Nader’s crusade against perceived unsafe designs in the automotive industry touched off a movement, one which continues today. The latest battle was in court as Ford faced a crushing lawsuit over a rollover accident involving a 2002 F-250 which rolled over in an accident, killing the two occupants inside. A jury in Georgia found the automaker is liable for their deaths to the tune of $1.7 billion."
