            "text": "Imagine, if you will, being a 13-year-old boy who has recently moved to Hollywood, South Florida, after a life of hard work in rural Virginia. Eventually, getting caught up with marijuana and partying, you fully embrace the lifestyle of the 1960s and '70s with your fellow hippie friends. Perhaps your father is less than thrilled at your new lifestyle choices, but you eventually begin selling weed to pay for your extravagant taste. Again your father expresses concerns over your life choices as he sends you to work in construction. Little did you know that this would be a blessing disguised as your co-workers becoming your core customer base, allowing you to buy a boat and quickly begin smuggling drugs. This was the childhood of racing's toughest rookie Randy Lanier, who eventually became America's most prolific drug smuggler and racing car driver. So how did this scrappy young teenager become such an icon in racing and organized crime?",

Just a short time before the start of his career, he had purchased a boat with his money and began trafficking marijuana at the request of a close friend. Randy didn't see much wrong with it at the time, as weed was less criminalized than even today, which is really saying something. However, it became clear that Lanier had a knack for racing as he barreled past other drivers faster than most would ever dare travel. Racing is a sport meant only for the most daring individuals, so Randy excelled at it. Eventually, Lanier found the darker side of drug dealing when he was confronted by a burglar in his home, which led him to call off his criminal ventures.",

Eventually, Ford approached Randy and asked him to leave his current team, Blue Thunder Racing, named after a Government anti-drug task force, and join them at the Ford Racing team. While the offer was tempting, Lanier eventually turned them down to keep his friends by his side. Little did he know this would be the play that would seal his fate forever. ",

This put Randy in a sticky position as he was soon put under investigation. One drug smuggling deal entailed smuggling 83 tons, or 166,000 lbs, of marijuana which would have been the most significant load. After the deal was complete, Randy thought about retirement as the shipment would have been worth around $55million. However, due to a leak in the area of the ship responsible for holding the weed, the pot began to break down, causing the hull to fill with methane gas. When the team retrieved the substance, the heat from the tools they used to cut through the metal ignited the gas, setting the boat on fire. Randy's last haul of weed resulted in the authorities cracking down even harder on the drug smuggling enterprise. ",
