Likely having sat for multiple decades, it’s crazy to think about just How long it may have been since one of these cars touched the road. So what exactly are these three masterpieces that seem to reflect the best designs of their times?"

Built in 1964, this old school muscle car was a great choice for anyone with a knack for unique automobiles. Right next to that you’ll find a pretty well-preserved Ford Ranchero GT. Both of these cars represent some of the best design features that Ford could offer in their respective eras."

All of these cars are in pretty rough shape, as you might expect from three vehicles that have been sitting in a forest for a few years. However, none of these cars are beyond the point where saving them is possible. So, the question really is, do you think they will be?"
