The game is slated to release approximately in December 2020 on PC, Mac, Linux and Nintendo Switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the overview:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Pecaminosa</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>Police Action RPG</strong>, based on&nbsp;<strong>a Film Noir&nbsp;concept</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>Pixel Art aesthetic</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>As John Souza</strong>&nbsp;– a former detective succumbed to the pleasures of alcohol and flesh – you will<strong>&nbsp;explore&nbsp;the city&nbsp;</strong>and its unique environments, as well as&nbsp;<strong>fight&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;thieves</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>chase&nbsp;smart&nbsp;criminals</strong>, and even some&nbsp;<strong>forces of…&nbsp;the occult</strong>.</p><p><strong>Pecaminosa</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>dark&nbsp;gambling city</strong>&nbsp;that smells of&nbsp;<strong>death</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>sex</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>gunpowder</strong>. And&nbsp;you know what? Once you are&nbsp;there, you’ll get the opportunity to experience&nbsp;this&nbsp;<strong>fictional&nbsp;open-ended city,</strong>&nbsp;all the while&nbsp;<strong>living through a humorous</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>provocative</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>rich&nbsp;story</strong>, full of&nbsp;twists, turns and…a lot of liquor.</p><p><strong>This is no hero story</strong>. Actually,&nbsp;<strong>John Souza&nbsp;</strong>is more&nbsp;of the anti-hero kind of guy:&nbsp;he&nbsp;<strong>gambles&nbsp;at casinos</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>spends&nbsp;his money&nbsp;on&nbsp;smokes&nbsp;and&nbsp;liquor</strong>&nbsp;(did we mention&nbsp;a lot of liquor&nbsp;already? We did? Ok… good… just making sure).&nbsp;</p><p>That is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>until<strong>,&nbsp;one night,&nbsp;he is visited by&nbsp;Charlie ‘Two Angels’,</strong>&nbsp;back from the dead. Turns out&nbsp;even the vilest of men&nbsp;<strong>got one last chance for a ticket to the&nbsp;Heaven&nbsp;lottery&#8230;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Aided by a mysterious Dark Book,&nbsp;&nbsp;Souza will have to&nbsp;help him&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;taking down his former associates.</p><p>Maybe now, both of you have a shot&nbsp;at&nbsp;redemption&nbsp;(take this as a free tip, Johnny-boy)&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Pecaminosa - Indiegogo Campaign Trailer\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQab1_TFSgM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cereal Games look to recreate a film noir setting with all of the attention to detail you could imagine. The dialogue captures the atmosphere well and we&#8217;re incredibly excited to see how the L.I.F.E system plays out, providing RPG depth to a run and gunning topdown action game. And if worse comes to worst, we can always take an hour or so out our daily tommy gunning each other to play some Texas Hold &#8217;em.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pecaminosa</em> requires €10,000 and is currently sitting at €8,976 after 260 backers with 30 days remaining.
