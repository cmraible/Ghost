This engine, tuned specifically for this race, churns out a staggering 770hp and 1,000Nm of torque, 120hp more than its usual output. A 10-speed automatic transmission feeds this power to the rear wheels. Despite its power, it carries some weight, coming in at 1,748kg."

The power, managed by an 8-speed automatic transmission, is also rear-driven. Weighing slightly less than the Camaro, the Dodge registers 1,720kg on the scales."

Like its competitors, power is sent to the rear wheels, but via a 6-speed manual gearbox, a possible disadvantage in this high-octane duel. However, it has the weight advantage, mirroring the Dodge's 3920-lbs."
