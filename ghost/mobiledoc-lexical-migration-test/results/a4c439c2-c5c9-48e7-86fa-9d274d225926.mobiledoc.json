Fortunately, the car was recovered from the lake by the Lawrence county police and fire department. The lake in question is Bessemer Lake in Pennsylvania. It was eventually discovered that the vehicle was stolen in Union Township, New Jersey. The car itself appears to be a 2020 Nissan Versa, it also sports an initial MSRP of around $15,000. While the silver compact car may not be as exciting as some other stolen icons, looking at you Dodge, it is still a vital piece of someone’s life that was taken away by someone stupid enough to crash it in a lake both endangering themselves, others, and the surrounding wildlife."

It is unknown how the car's various metals and electrical equipment has affected the surrounding water and environment, however, probably, the vehicle hasn't been there long enough to leave permanent damage. Unfortunately, while the car was found in the lake, the thief was not found with it and the search will continue as the investigation goes on."
