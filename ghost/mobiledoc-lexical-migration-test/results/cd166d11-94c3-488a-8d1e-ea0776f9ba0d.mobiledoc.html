<p>Straight from the factory, the 1969 Oldsmobile Cutlass was an impressive muscle car, but if you wanted max performance from this car, the 380-horsepower 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rare-1972-hurst-olds-pace-car-convertible/">Hurst/Olds</a> is the way to go. Although power was high, production was very low, and that means these cars are extremely rare and expensive today. The good news is that this 1969 Oldsmobile Cutlass convertible being offered with no reserve through GAA Classic Car Auctions has been modified to pack the performance similar to a Hurst/Olds using the heart of a Cadillac.</p>

<p>The 1970 Plymouth Superbird was designed specifically to dominate on the high banks of a NASCAR oval track.
