He convinced management that taking part in NASCAR Speed Week would help with the brand’s image, but only after working on highlighting factory customer racers. Success with Chevrolets at Daytona spread through the enthusiast community and Wanger’s managers admitted he had a point as Chevy was branded “The Hot One.”"

The man also influenced the creation of the GTO Judge and the Trans Am."
