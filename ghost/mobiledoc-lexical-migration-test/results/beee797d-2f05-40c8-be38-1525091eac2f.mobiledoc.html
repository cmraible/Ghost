Even though this bike looks like a heavily modified V-Rod, this is actually the way it came from the factory.</h3>

<p>The early 2000s were a great time for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2012-harley-davidson-softail-deluxe/">Harley-Davidson</a>. They were doing well enough, in fact, that someone (or several someones) in Milwaukee signed off on a truly <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ice-road-bikers/">incredible project</a>.</p>
<p>Harley-Davidson was going to set out to build a factory drag <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/tom-cruise-bike-collection/">bike</a> capable of sub-10 second quarter mile times. Best of all, they weren’t going to build just one – they were going to build hundreds of them.</p>

<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-harley-driven-from-sidecar/">Harley-Davidson</a> Custom Vehicle Operations (CVO) ended up with this, the VRXSE Screamin' Eagle Destroyer. It’s powered by a heavily modified 1300cc water-cooled V-twin engine with a stroker crankshaft and high-compression pistons producing 165 horsepower.</p>
<p>The VRXSE Destoyer also features a beefed-up racing transmission with a multi-stage lock-up clutch, a programmable shift light, and two-stage launch control. </p>

<p>Initially, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1939-harley-davidson-el-knucklehead/">Harley-Davidson</a> only planned on building between 150-300 VRXSE Destoyers. Harley-Davidson dealer response was so positive, however, that production was increased to around 600 units in total.</p>
<p>The first owner was a drag racing enthusiast, who carefully kept the bike in perfect condition for museum display alongside other drag racing memorabilia. In 2011, it was purchased by <a href="https://canepa.com/photo-gallery/2006-harleydavidson-vrxse-screamin-eagle-destroyer3975v/">Canepa</a> for their collection, and they continued caring for this special bike as if it were a priceless Van Gogh painting.</p>

<p>In a strange twist of irony, most VRXSE Destoyers ended up like this one – display pieces. While this one may never see the sub-10 second quarter mile passes it was initially designed for, it’s an important piece of Harley history and it deserves a place in any serious <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/keanu-reeves-motorcycle-collection/">motorcycle collection</a>. Even though Harley-Davidson ended up building many more than they had initially planned, it’s still a rare machine.</p>
