This Dodge is welded onto an M1009 military frame and chassis, which makes sense since the muscle car’s frame likely wouldn’t have the torsional rigidity for hardcore rock crawling. Up front is a Dana 44 with locking hubs, while the rear has Dana 60 straight axles and 3.52 gears. As you can see, the 37-inch BFGoodrich KM2 tires are appropriately aggressive. What you don’t see are the Skyjacker Black MAX shocks."
