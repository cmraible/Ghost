Sure, the increased popularity of crossovers is helping to fuel the trend, but that’s only part of the problem. Go put a modern Porsche 911 next to a classic 911 and it quickly becomes apparent just how much vehicles have ballooned in size. What’s worse, car leasing service Vanarama points out what we all know: soon vehicles will outgrow the size of the average parking spot."

This phenomenon has been documented for some time, but a lot of people wouldn’t comfortably fit in vehicles made in the 80s and 90s, and we’re not talking about a lack of legroom. Automakers have been making seats wider, adding more hip- and shoulder-room to accommodate the growing ranks of people who are obese."
