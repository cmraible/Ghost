Under the hood is a 5.3-liter LS6 V8 which was remanufactured by Jasper, providing plenty of predictable, reliable power and ease of servicing. Bolted up to that is an SM465 four-speed manual transmission for ultimate control on any trail. "

Instead, under that classic body is a mandrel-bent 2x4 3/16-inch steel frame that’s been powder coated gloss black for longevity and a clean presentation. Thanks to new leaf springs donated by a Jeep YJ, combined with nice Bilstein shocks along with a front sway bar and rear traction bar, the ride is smooth and responsive."

Either way, you’re enjoying nice leather seats, and the driver’s seat even slides forward/aft for the ideal fit. While you’re not getting all the bells and whistles of modern Jeeps, you are getting simplicity, a lighter vehicle, and the chance to have some truly unique adventures."
