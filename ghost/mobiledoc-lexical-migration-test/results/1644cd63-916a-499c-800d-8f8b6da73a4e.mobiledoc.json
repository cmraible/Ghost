For our American readers, that’s over 124 mph in a speed zone where the limit was posted at 110 km/h or 68 mph on June 3. However, that wasn’t the end of the troubles for the driver."

Considering how much he likely had to shell out for the Ferrari, we doubt he didn’t have the cash to make his car legal for use on Australian roads."

In what should be a surprise to nobody, his car was loaded onto a wrecker and taken to an impound lot where it will stay for three months."

He was also given a court attendance notice for “drive vehicle recklessly/furiously or speed/manner dangerous, exceed speed limit – over 45kph, and use unregistered motor vehicle.” In other words, he’ll likely be facing many more consequences for really seeing what his Ferrari Portofino can do on an open road."

Find a track with a long straightaway, do what it takes to attend an event where you can drive your car on that track, and it’s also a good idea to secure track insurance as well as some professional instruction first. Don’t treat public roads like your personal racetrack – it makes all other enthusiasts look bad."
