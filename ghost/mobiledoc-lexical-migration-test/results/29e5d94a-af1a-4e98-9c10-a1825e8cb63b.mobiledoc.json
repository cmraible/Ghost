Once again, the car won Le Mans in 1953 via the use of that same disc brake system and a 3.4-liter inline-six pushing out 220 horsepower equipped with triple Weber 40DC03 carburetors. The immense popularity surrounding these cars lead to them having an extremely high value, this is further pushed by the fact that only 53 cars were made and only 43 of those were sold to private owners."

However, to soothe any questions as to the retention of value for the earlier models, the continuation cars will be stamped with a completely new chassis number and distinct features to allow easy identification of the car as having been built in 2021. This enables the vintage cars, originally built in the 1950s, to retain their value while still allowing the continuation to be produced and sold without backlash from the extensive collector's community."
