The driver of this Ford Mustang was slapped into handcuffs and hauled off to sit for awhile in county after he wrecked into a tree while intoxicated. While that isn't funny by any stretch of the imagination, the bumper stickers on the back of the car brought some ironic humor."

As protocol, they activated the flashing blue lights to pull the Mustang over. The orange Mustang continued to speed off but ultimately met a tree head-on."

Miraculously, there were no fatalities to report here, except for one bright orange Mustang. The driver and passenger were both uninjured, but the back seat passenger was taken to the hospital with a possible back injury. The driver of this car was a 20-year-old female with a learning license and was not following the rules of limiting her car to one person. Even more, the 20-year-old driver was also intoxicated."
