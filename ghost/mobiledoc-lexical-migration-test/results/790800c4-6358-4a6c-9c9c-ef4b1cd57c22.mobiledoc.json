The red example is in immaculate condition, but Alex does say that he drives it daily without issue, ferrying kids around and even taking it to the hardware store. It’s 450-horsepower motor is mighty impressive, but Porsche designed it to be usable everyday. Adjustable hydraulic suspension — a pioneering feature on a car such as this — makes for a surprisingly compliant ride. It was also the world’s first car to use run-flat tires for fear of a blowout at near 200mph."

When the mirrors were fitted to the lightweight doors, the method used inadvertently caused a faint ripple in the paint finish. Cars without this have usually been repaired with the telltale blemish removed."
