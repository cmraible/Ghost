On her Facebook page it clearly states she’s “an actor and automotive influencer.” That doesn’t mean her car isn’t cool, but let’s get one thing straight: she didn’t build it. The 20-something is the face of the operation and the videos she makes are all about entertainment. You can like them and that’s fine, just be sure you realize what it is you’re consuming. Oh, plus she’s really good at hawking products for male pattern baldness, which tells you oh so much about her audience."
