<p>Flickr has published <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/2016/12/06/smartphones-dominate-flickr-in-2016-apple-leads/">its annual round-up of the most-used cameras</a>. Guess which one wins?</p>

<p>Apple, of course, is a proxy for “iPhone” here. The iPhone is the biggest camera brand on Flickr by a significant margin. And I bet you it would be an ever bigger margin on Instagram.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Smartphones accounted for 48% of the photos uploaded to Flickr, up from 39% last year. DSLR was 25%, down from 31% in 2015, and point and shoot was 21%, down from 25% in 2015. Mirrorless remained flat at 3% of photos uploaded in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m vaguely surprised by the low numbers for mirrorless cameras – that makes me wonder if the community that have adopted them haven’t found themselves a home on Flickr. Or perhaps the mirrorless hype has been over-blown.</p>
<h2 id="wherethephonewontgo">Where the phone won’t go</h2>
<p>Om Malik speculates about what these figures means for <a href="http://om.co/2016/12/07/again-iphone-is-the-default-camera/">the future of the stand-alone camera</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We are already seeing cameras evolve and become hyper specialized — Snapchat’s Spectacles, GoPro Cameras and Drone-mounted cameras for aerial work. I suspect by the time 2020 rolls around the point and shoot share of overall photography just might be down to single digits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It feels like stand-alone cameras are being pushed into the niches that phones can’t comfortably fill: you don’t want you phone hundreds of feet away in the sky, nor do you want to strap it to your bike for filming – because it’s more likely to be destroyed in an accident, and the battery won’t hold up as well as a dedicated camera. But these are edge cases, suitable for niche companies.</p>
<p>The phone is now the default camera.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
