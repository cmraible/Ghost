<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I am incredibly excited to announce our newest hire: Frank Cappello, our new podcast and live event producer. And I want to thank you — our supporting subscribers — for making this (and our upcoming new podcast) happen.</p>
<p>You answered our call to pitch in — and now we’re expanding.</p>
<p>Frank comes to <em>The Lever </em>with a wealth of experience, space, having worked as a longtime producer for the celebrated podcast <em>WTF with Marc Maron</em>. He also helped produce <em>BuzzFeed’s</em> daily news podcast and several shows for the major podcast network Earwolf Media. As one of his colleagues put it, any media outlet would be lucky to have him,</p>
<p>Just as important, Frank, who also runs a brilliant <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@frankly_socialist">socialist TikTok account</a>, has long been a supporter of our work. As he noted when he first contacted us, “I think the reporting you all are doing is some of the most important journalism being done today and I would love to contribute in any way possible.”</p>
<p>Now he will get a chance to do so. Frank is already hard at work developing a weekly podcast we will launch in the next few weeks. The show will mix investigative journalism with insightful analysis of the week’s news — with a familiar face in front of the microphone. This will be the first of a variety of shows we aim to develop as part of a full <em>Lever</em> podcast network.</p>
<p>Please know that this is thanks is all of our supporting subscribers who responded when we asked folks to pitch in to support our podcast project several weeks ago. As you always do, you came through with flying colors — so thank you again for all of your support.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, even with our expansion into the podcast space, nothing will change about our editorial commitment to you. Every weekday you will still receive our latest original reporting in our inbox, as well as regular supporting subscriber-only exclusives, including You Love To See It, Weekend Reader, and our brand-new Cheat Sheet. Also, with Frank taking over production of our virtual chats, we should soon be offering additional live events for you, too.</p>
<p>If you want to help out more, please feel free to donate a few additional dollars using our digital tip jar:</p>

<p>Please join me in welcoming Frank to our team. With your support, we are truly building a new independent media that holds the powerful accountable.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
