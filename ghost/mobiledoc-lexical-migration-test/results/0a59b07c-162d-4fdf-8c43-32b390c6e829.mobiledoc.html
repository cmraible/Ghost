<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Joe Biden’s campaign is attacking us because we reported something that made them retreat — and so <a href="#/portal/signup">we need you to click here and help us right now</a>.</p>
<p>To review: this week, we published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/team-biden-now-signals-austerity">huge story</a> that forced Biden’s campaign to frantically backpedal away from echoing Republican talking points. It was proof that our accountability journalism is working. Now, Biden’s campaign is <a href="https://twitter.com/gregpinelo/status/1297236876626137089">attacking us</a> — it deployed its <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewperezdc/status/1297253904388952065?s=21">paid campaign consultant</a> to publish an angry diatribe calling TMI “irrelevant,” even as our reporting forced Biden’s campaign to walk back its comments about budget austerity.</p>

<p>Clearly, our accountability journalism about both parties is having a major impact — and we are right now trying to expand that journalism. So here’s my ask:</p>
<p><strong>We need everyone who can to go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> to pitch in and become a supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>Let me be clear: in the same week we published our impactful story about Biden, we also broke some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-trump-donors-firm-got-big-postal">big news about Donald Trump administration rewarding GOP donors</a>. The point here is: we are a grassroots-funded news outlet that scrutinizes BOTH political parties, whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>Thanks for considering this request. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
