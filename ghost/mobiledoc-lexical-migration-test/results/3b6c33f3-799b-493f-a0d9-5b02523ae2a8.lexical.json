But take those out, and it becomes clear that the article is about nothing but national newspaper journalism. This is all about a particular subset of the ink-stained wretches, without even an acknowledgement that some of the wretches manage to get by without ever getting ink-stained.\n\nJournalism is a very, very broad church – and it was so long before the internet came along to knock down some walls, pop in an extra transept or two, and generally widen the whole place. Radio, TV, newspapers (local and national), consumer magazines, business magazines, niche subscription-only titles. Online news sites. Blogs. And now the whole, growing world of hyperniche and hyperlocal sites.\n\nIt takes a particular, narrow, myopic, conservative world to see this as a time of desolation for journalism.If your niche, your comfortable little cranny of publishing is closing up, then yes, things look bleak. They look particularly horrible if you root some of your identity in being part of some exclusive little club of journalists who have “made it” – only to find that club crumbling around your ears.  Sure, it’s tough for traditional journalism-derived businesses, and for a particular paradigm of reporting. But for journalism, and journalists, the rules are shifting – and they’re shifting in favour of the individual, the passionate and the skilled. And I can’t help but see that as a good thing.\n"
