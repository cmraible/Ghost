However, despite the obvious financial burden, one aspect of motorsport gained quite a lot of traction; that aspect was drag racing. This was a fun cheap way for people to hang out with other enthusiasts and light up some rubber along the way in a time when car people didn't have anywhere else to go. Eventually, this translated into Pro Stock drag racing and many teams started to pop up, one such team was called “Mopar Missiles.”",
