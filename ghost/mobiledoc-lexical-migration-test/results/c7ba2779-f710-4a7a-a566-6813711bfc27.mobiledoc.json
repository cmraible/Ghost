According to Andrew Shirley, editor of Luxury Investment Index at Knight Frank, there are two items which were at the top of the KFLII but have fallen from those spots, rare bottles of scotch and Hermes handbags. Still, it’s important to note handbags enjoy a 91% 10-year growth rate and rare whiskey sits better than anything else in the top 10 with 483% increase in the past decade. Those two items have seen a negative 3% and negative 4% growth in the past 12 months, showing the market can be volatile."
