From there, this Ford boasts a polished set of American Racing torque thrust wheels wrapped in Mickey Thompson tires including massive 15-inch wide rubber in the back! The canted radiator and blower-like air cleaner housing finish off this '32 Ford's incredible look."

The Ford rides on a custom fabricated tube chassis that has been z-cut in the front for a perfect stance that is still ideal for driving, and the build uses a Mustang II front end and a nine-inch Ford rear end."
