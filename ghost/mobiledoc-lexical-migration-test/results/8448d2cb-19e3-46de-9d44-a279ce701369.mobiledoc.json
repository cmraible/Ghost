          "Tesla's Motor Direct Drive system might not have the deep rumble of a Chevy LS3 or LT4 V8, but there's no doubt this will deliver plenty of low-end torque to combat any terrain. Interestingly, the image from ECD Automotive Design shows a split battery layout with a single electric drive motor affixed to a transfer case and a seemingly conventional driveshaft and axle design. That means the Electric Defender should not only retain the Defender's legendary off-road capability, the spread out weight distribution should give the SUV better handling on- and off-road."
