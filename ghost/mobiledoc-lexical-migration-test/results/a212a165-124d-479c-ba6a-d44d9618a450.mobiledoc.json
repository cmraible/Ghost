The key insight that gave Google an advantage over all the other search engines in the late 90s was that every link to a page could be considered a “vote” in that page’s favour. The more links to a page, the more important it must be, and therefore the better it should rank in search. That still applies, even though the number of signals involved has grown more complicated, as we discussed above."

When you link to external sites, search engines look at the anchor text you use, and to what it knows about the site you’re linking to, and uses that to help determine what your page is about - it adds context that can help you rank in search. Linking internally can help transfer both meaning and importance from one page to another."
