<p>Thirty-five years ago, Pres. Ronald Reagan vilified the phrase, “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” So launched decades of federal powers being limited in favor of state action and private-sector solutions. As a result, we are now woefully unprepared to adequately combat multiple national crises, from climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we argue in this edition of Weekend Reader, it’s time to bury Reagan and his destructive legacy once and for all — and that process begins with accountability, which is what <em>The Daily Poster</em> is all about.</p>
<p>That and much more in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gassing-satartia-mississippi-co2-pipeline_n_60ddea9fe4b0ddef8b0ddc8f"><strong>The Gassing Of Satartia</strong></a> (HuffPost)  — <em>“This story is the result of a 19-month HuffPost/Climate Investigations Center investigation into the Satartia pipeline rupture, and the safety of CO2 pipelines. It is based on interviews with more than 60 witnesses, victims, first responders, lawyers, medical and toxicological experts, pipeline and petroleum experts, and public health officials; and a review of medical records, police and fire reports, 911 recordings, emergency dispatch logs, internal documents from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and the state Department of Environmental Quality, as well as federal pipeline incident reports. Meanwhile, the federal government is taking the first steps to vastly increase the size of the nation’s carbon dioxide pipeline network as a way of fighting climate change. Our investigation reveals that such pipelines pose threats that few are aware of and even fewer know how to handle.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/08/virginia-militia-bedford-campbell-county/"><strong>Armed Picnics And Snipers At Family Dollar: Life In A Town With A Government-Approved Militia</strong></a> (Mother Jones) — <em>“Loosely affiliated groups of armed militias are nothing new to the American landscape, but by the count of the Anti-Defamation League, the number of militias in the US quadrupled between 2007 and late 2009… At first, they came together to protest state mask mandates and shutdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19, then to square off against Black Lives Matter activists during a summer of intense protest, then to rally at ballot-counting centers on behalf of Donald Trump’s Big Lie, and then, finally, to storm the US Capitol on January 6 in an attempt to overturn the results of the election. Amid the rise of far-right extremist groups nationwide, Virginia is the only state where local governments are legitimizing their regional militias. In Bedford County and its neighboring Campbell County the local governments are trying to rebrand their militias from extremist paramilitary groups operating on the fringe of society into an official arm of the state—one with a more family-friendly image of protecting neighbors rather than bombing government buildings.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/08/us/colorado-river-water-shortage/"><strong>The Southwest’s Most Important River Is Drying Up</strong></a><strong></strong>(CNN) —<em> This is an important interactive examination of of the crisis unfolding on the river system that “supplies 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico, and irrigates more than 5 million acres of farmland on its way into Mexico and the Gulf of California.”</em></p>

At a time when well-​funded efforts to sow mistrust in the election were already underway, Coomer had given conspiracy theorists a valuable resource, a grain of sand they could transform into something that had the feel — the false promise — of proof.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

The cuts followed an announcement that the company planned to reduce its written content by as much as half and invest more heavily in video… Media-watchers groaned at the hellish circularity of Vice’s strategy — digital media companies have tried pivoting to video before, without finding a pot of gold at the end of the livestream. </em>Vice <em>also repeated a well-worn fallacy: that bosses are nimble at adapting to new formats but their employees aren’t, and need to be replaced. In a statement, the </em>Vice <em>union described the layoffs as a ‘macabre annual ritual’ at the company. ‘We have worked in this industry long enough to know today’s metrics are tomorrow’s punch lines, and yesterday’s pivot is today’s clumsy tumble.’</em></p>
<p><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-shadowy-business-of-international-education/"><strong>The Shadowy Business of International Education</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Walrus) — <em>“International students are also the product of a system that has blurred the lines between immigration and education in an unofficial, ad hoc arrangement meant to appeal to potential immigrants while avoiding any responsibility for their settlement. It’s a system that is quietly transforming postsecondary institutions, which have grown dependent on fees from foreign students and therefore on the shadowy world of education agents who deliver them. And it’s a system built on attracting teenagers like Kushandeep from small villages across the world, taking their money, and bringing them to campuses from small-town Nova Scotia to suburban BC with lofty promises for the future but little regard for what actually happens to them once they arrive.”</em></p>

So Why Is Everyone Mad At Them?</strong></a><strong></strong>(Nieman Lab) —<em> “If you drop poison into Facebook’s content well, it can be extraordinarily effective at spreading it out. That’s a terrible and important reality. But it’s also true that it only matters if the poison gets dropped in the first place. There’s no way for mainstream news organizations to keep all the poison out of social media, of course. But is it too much to ask for news outlets to refrain from dropping it in ourselves? Or at least to be a little reflective when it turns out we were the ones doing the poisoning?”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/30/the-real-ceo-of-succession"><strong>The Real CEO of “Succession”</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“For some viewers, Armstrong’s thoroughgoing commitment to a curdled view of humanity… made the show at once intolerable and irresistible. ‘i hate everyone on “succession” and i can’t stop watching,’ a typical headline read. The show is so unsettling, in part, because it offers no vantage points exterior to its scrupulously rendered universe — there is no outsider figure who is easier to identify with than the amoral protagonists… Culture critics have popularized the term ‘wealth porn’ to characterize shows, such as ‘Billions’ or ‘Gossip Girl,’ that lavish attention on the consumption habits of the absurdly wealthy. But, if the shiny surface of ‘Succession’ bears a relation to pornography, it is less because it titillates than because it partakes of pornography’s deadening relentlessness.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/23/tag-team"><strong>Tag Team</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>A lovely vignette capturing the spirit of Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, who passed away at 80 this week. Watts’ response when someone asked him he’d rather do other than perform? “‘You sound like Keith,’ Watts said, meaning Keith Richards. ‘I’m always saying, “I’m tired, I want to retire,” and he says, “Charlie, what else would you do?”’”</em></p>

<h3 id="a-message-from-the-daily-poster">A Message From <em>The Daily Poster</em>:</h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This is <em>Daily Poster</em> reporter Walker Bragman. I wanted to share some thoughts with you.</p>
<p>On August 12, 1986, President Ronald Wilson Reagan addressed the American public and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCedOQJ0ZEA">declared</a>, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’” In a single sentence, Reagan summed up his vision for the country: federal power sidelined in favor of state action and the private sector.</p>
<p>It’s been almost four decades since Reagan laid out the ideological underpinnings of a revolution that would take hold of Washington for a generation — a neoliberal movement that remains potent to this day. In that time, industry has brought the planet’s biosphere to the brink of collapse, the nation’s wealth has increasingly found its way into the hands of the modern landed gentry, and our once impressive public infrastructure has been left to crumble or been sold off to private interests. All the while, the federal government has remained largely hands-off.</p>
<p>The Reagan tradition has left us wholly unable to tackle the deadly COVID-19 pandemic ripping its way through our most vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>If we are to pull through as a nation in defiance of the multitude of crises weighing down on us, from the pandemic to global warming, the time has come to bury Reagan and his destructive legacy once and for all.</p>
<p>That process begins with accountability — which is what <em>The Daily Poster </em>is all about.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>This week, <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-corporate-deterrent-to-more-vaccinations/">reported</a> on the federal reluctance to embrace systemic changes that could help encourage more widespread vaccinations. That coverage followed a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-mounting-pandemic-failures/">report</a> last week on the Biden administration’s unwillingness to impose the kinds of mandates and lockdowns that health experts have been calling for.</p>
<p>We also <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rahms-reward/">wrote</a> about how notorious privatizer Rahm Emanuel, whose greatest hits include attempting to cover up video of the police murder of a Black teenager, has been rewarded with an ambassadorship nomination. And looking beyond the Beltway, we explored how South Central Los Angeles has become a focal point for the nation’s housing crisis — a crisis likely to get worse once the state’s eviction moratorium expires next month.</p>
<p>We strive to give you, our readers, an inside look at how the sausage is made in Washington and beyond — so that you might be the ones to demand the changes our country desperately needs.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Walker</p>
