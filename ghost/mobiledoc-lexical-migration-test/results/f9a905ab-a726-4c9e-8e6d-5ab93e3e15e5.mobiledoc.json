What’s more bizarre about this case is nobody seemed to know how many cars were stolen."

Those build-shy cars were supposedly being stored until the microprocessors were in high supply, but that still hasn’t happened. It doesn’t seem likely the cars taken didn’t have the chips, but we’re not sure about that."

We don’t know the motivation of this theft since little information has been released, even though we’ve waited to bring this news to you, hoping more details would be released. It’s possible they were taken just for joyriding purposes, to be used as getaway cars in other crimes, or that they were stripped of parts. Since we don’t know the state of the recovered vehicles, it’s difficult to say why they were taken. But one thing we do know is the crime problem in this country seems to still be spinning out of control. In other words, do everything you can to secure your vehicles and be sure to carry good insurance coverage, especially for theft, because you might need it."
