Its luxury arm, Lexus, came in second from the bottom at 23 days, while Chevrolet and GMC were right behind it at 25 days each. Ford, which has been slashing production the most in North America, sits at 36 days. Not surprisingly, getting a Fiat or Alfa Romeo is considerably easier, with those two brands boasting 80 and 88 days of supply, respectively."

Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough addressed that. “Supply was much lower in May than in April, but it is hard to say sales have been negatively impacted yet,” said Chesbrough. “However, we expect that June’s sales numbers to show less activity since dealers can’t sell what they don’t have.”"
