While these people are gathered on the side of the road and the ‘Cuda is admittedly doing something illegal by turning smokey donuts across both lanes of traffic, nobody is blocking off the road for 20 minutes, causing a traffic jam in a busy part of a city while 2 or 3 cars at a time perform donuts and other tricks to wow a crowd of hundreds. This is a much more wholesome version of the fun as one man enjoys his car in front of a modest-sized group, then takes off down the road."
