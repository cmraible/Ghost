<p>Prior to 2015, <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1985-jeep-j20/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=testmotorious">this truck was fully disassembled</a>, media blasted, repainted, and reassembled. The underside and the bed received a LineX coating and all of the moldings, seals, and trim pieces were replaced. An Avocado Green finish is arguably the perfect color for this truck and the mixture of bright chromework and black trim accents it beautifully.</p>

<p>Under the hood sits a GM Performance Parts ZZ4 355hp crate motor mounted to an Art Carr 700r4 transmission that features a toggle-switch controlled lock-up converter. <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1985-jeep-j20/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=testmotorious">This new found power</a> is pushed to the Dana 44 HD and Dana 60 axles through the rebuilt NP205 transfer case. The suspension and steering systems were rebuilt and 4-inch lift kit from BJ’s off-road makes room for the aggressive-looking all-terrain tires.</p>

<p>Sitting on the freshly recovered black vinyl bench seat, obvious modifications consist of an Ididit steering column, a new steering wheel, and a new floor shifter. However, a Vintage Air under dash AC system and a custom Auto Meter gauge cluster are <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1985-jeep-j20/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=testmotorious">a little more subtle</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being nearly 40-years old, this truck is in perfect condition and with more ground clearance and more horsepower, it is more capable than it was when it first rolled off the assembly line. At the time of publishing, <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1985-jeep-j20/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=testmotorious">the bidding</a> was up to just $2,200 with about 11-days left on the clock. See it <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1985-jeep-j20/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=testmotorious">here.</a></p>
