However now that developers will be beginning new titles with the Switch development kit in hand, the bridge will be closing in 2019.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s his full quote here&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re talking today about a platform that is 16 months old. The development cycle today is multiple years. So I would argue that beginning at the end of this year, or next year, that gap will have closed. Because key developers have had the development systems, they’ll have been working to create content for our platform from the beginning. That’s what is going to close that time gap.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited to see some more third-party support on Switch, but what games would you like to see on the hybrid console?
