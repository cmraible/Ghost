<p>Hypercars are some of the most violently powerful and raw vehicles currently in production across the globe. Combining decades of hard work with styling and engineering to match, these incredible autos are truly something to be in awe of. Without a doubt, the Italians sort of specialize in this sort of performance which would make the fact that the world’s first electric hypercar was built there. So what exactly makes this electric <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/rocket-88-where-it-all-began/">rocket</a> ship so attractive to the Italian automotive market?</p>

<p>With an MSRP of $2.2 million, this Pininfarina Battista is a true work of art. One thing almost everyone can agree on is that Italians appreciate a sleek and tasteful design. This car is incredibly good at combining aggression with elegance to create the perfect balance of speed. Speaking of speed, you can’t exactly go fast unless you’ve got the mechanical workings to match. That’s exactly why this masterpiece utilizes four electric motors to push out some truly astonishing numbers.</p>
<p>To be precise, the car is capable of producing 1,900 horsepower which can only be described as bonkers. With that in mind it’s still pretty wild that the car can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just under two seconds, completing the 0-62 mph in 2.0 seconds flat. A video about the car pointed out its 217 mph top speed and asked its audience if they’d buy the car. Of course, that channel was highly focused on finance so on this topic it’s better if car people answer the question. So, would you buy this car?</p>
