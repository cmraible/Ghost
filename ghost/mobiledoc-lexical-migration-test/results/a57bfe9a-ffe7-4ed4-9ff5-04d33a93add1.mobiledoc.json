          " is a very special example packed with all the options available to the Shelby models. With the Carbon Fiber Track Package with exposed carbon fiber wheels, GT4 track wing, and Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 tires, this Mustang is equipped to dominate the competition on the track while luxuries like the Technology Package make for a more road friendly driving experience. Under the hood is a 5.2-liter supercharged cross plane crank V8 with 760 hp and 625 lb.-ft of torque mated to Ford’s dual-clutch transmission with launch control. Putting all that power to good use is an advanced suspension system that includes the MagneRide damping system and ensuring smooth and accurate stops is a set of Brembo brakes. "
