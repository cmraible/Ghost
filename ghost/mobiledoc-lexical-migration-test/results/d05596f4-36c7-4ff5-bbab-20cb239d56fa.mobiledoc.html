<p>When a pair of federal bills were introduced last year — one pressing for diplomatic talks to end the state of war between North Korea, South Korea, and the U.S., and the other urging the U.S. to prioritize Korean family reunification — a digital ad ran in Times Square warning that the bills would “Benefit North Korea and China” and “Dismantle the UN Command and Remove US Troops from S. Korea.” </p>
<p>The messengers? One Korea Network and the Korea Conservative Political Action Conference, wealthy pressure groups working to gin up tensions here and abroad. And as we highlight below in this edition of Weekend Reader, one Honolulu resident is the chief operative pulling the strings behind the scenes — and she may have a personal stake in the matter.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/08/the-unknown-oligarch-fighting-for-an-endless-korean-war/"><strong>The Unknown Oligarch Fighting For An Endless Korean War</strong></a> (Responsible Statecraft) — “<em>The opposition to these bills and the attacks against the grassroots activists who support them — many of whom are Korean American — have been led by a network of pressure groups with deep pockets, including a partnership with one of the biggest conservative political organizations in America; financial interests tied to fanning the flames of great-power competition with China; and media outlets that have amplified outlandish conspiracy theories about North Korean and Chinese interference in South Korean and U.S. elections. Yet while this network might seem broad and disparate, a close examination of the efforts opposing diplomatic initiatives with North Korea circles back to one individual who rarely speaks or appears in public: Annie M.H. Chan, a resident of Honolulu.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://foreverwars.substack.com/p/no-fly-zone-ukraine-zelenskyy-thats-all-folks?s=r"><strong>As The Invasion Of Ukraine Goes On, Pressure To Escalate Goes Up</strong></a><em></em>(Forever Wars) —<em> “Biden ruling out a no-fly zone will perversely create countervailing political pressure for one the longer the occupation persists. The longer it persists, the worse it becomes. Unforgivable crimes like the Mariupol hospital bombing stack up. Ukrainians will plead to NATO to help them fight. The very fact that there isn’t a U.S. aerial corridor while horrors happen below will amplify the chorus of demands to start one. A whole bunch of people inside ‘national security’ circles who should know better are moving in this direction.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/leaving-lviv/"><strong>Leaving Lviv</strong></a><strong></strong>(Guernica) — <em>“If the Lviv of Zagajewski’s infanthood is but a mirage replaced by a new, otherworldly polis, is it really Lviv he is returning to? The poem always struck me as a meditation on the impossibility of returning to places we know only from family lore, from legend, from history books, from the food on our plate. From soup nothing.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/dsa-ukraine/"><strong>How An Anti-War Statement Made DSA A Target</strong></a> (The Nation) — <em>“The Democratic Socialists of America put out its own statement condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and calling on the United States to withdraw from NATO to ‘end the imperialist expansionism that set the stage’ for the conflict. The organization forcefully denounced Russia’s escalation, expressed solidarity with the working classes of Ukraine and Russia, demanded the acceptance of all refugees, and urged an ‘immediate ceasefire and the total withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.’ It seemed like a totally innocuous position to hold. But during times of war or major international crises, there’s little tolerance for anti-imperialist dissent. Warmongering voices are amplified by credulous media outlets, and those who stray from the consensus are accused of spreading propaganda or being on the side of terrorists. Efforts to explain or contextualize the underlying dynamics and historical events that led to the conflict are also stifled. The Ukraine crisis is no exception.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/cpac-showed-what-new-gop-cares-about/623883/"><strong>The New Republican Battle Cry</strong></a> (The Atlantic) —<em> “Once upon a time, it was anti-communism that knitted the movement together. Today, even as a new cold war breaks out, anti-wokeism is the glue that adheres the social conservatives who want to ban critical race theory, the populists who hate Big Business, the libertarians who still just want to drown the government in the bathtub. The slogan hovering over the room is awake, not woke. Nearly every speech includes a denunciation of the grand inquisitors of cancel culture.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/14/did-george-washington-have-an-enslaved-son"><strong>Did George Washington Have An Enslaved Son?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“Awareness of West Ford had faded both in Gum Springs and at Mount Vernon, but in recent years his story has been at the center of a bitter controversy between the two sites. His descendants have demanded that Mount Vernon recognize Ford for his contributions to the estate, which was near collapse during the decades after Washington’s death. They also argue — citing oral histories from two branches of the family — that Ford was Washington’s unacknowledged son, a claim that Mount Vernon officials have consistently denied. As that debate continues, Black civic organizations in Gum Springs are engaged in related battles to save their endangered community. They have resisted, with some success, Virginia’s planned expansion of Richmond Highway, which would encroach on the town, and they have embarked on the process of getting Gum Springs named a national historic site.”</em></li>
