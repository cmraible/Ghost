<p>Part racecar and part pro-touring restomod, this Mopar is 100 percent awesome! Although it's listed as a <a href="https://www.garagekeptmotors.com/vehicles/1250/1970-plymouth-cuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">'70 'Cuda</a>, this car's VIN shows that it actually started life as a standard 1974 Plymouth Barracuda powered by a 360 cubic-inch V8, but today it stands as a high-powered custom 'Cuda that's ready for the road or the track.</p>

<p>Back in the day, this '74 Barracuda was no slouch with its original 245-horsepower V8, but this engine has since been replaced with a supercharged 6.4-liter Hemi V8 sending 520 horsepower to the rear wheels. Complementing this hellacious engine are other upgrades such as the six-speed manual gearbox, four-wheel coilovers, a Ford nine-inch rear end and Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes with drilled and slotted rotors, while those massive 335/30ZR18 rear tires mounted on custom wheels lay down a solid contact patch. This Mopar is more than just a show car, too, as it participated in the 2018 Hot Rod Power Tour spanning several events across the Southeast.</p>

<p>From the outside, this 'Cuda definitely stands out starting with a fully custom fiberglass body from Downs Performance. That's why this '74 Barracuda looks like an earlier model with the dual headlight grille of a '71 and the horizontally slotted taillights used on the 1970 and 1971 models. The bright orange paint job and exposed carbon fiber accents makes this car hard to miss. As custom as the exterior is, the inside of this Mopar goes full stock car with removable windows, a roll cage with racing harnesses, a massive fuel cell mounted in the trunk and a custom console with an assortment of switches.</p>
<p>If you want to dominate car shows and track events alike, this <a href="https://www.garagekeptmotors.com/vehicles/1250/1970-plymouth-cuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">custom 'Cuda</a> is an awesome car, and it's currently listed by <a href="https://www.garagekeptmotors.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Garage Kept Motors</a> for $67,900. That seems like a great price for a turn-key Mopar restomod that's ready to show and go.</p>
