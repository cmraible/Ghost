For 1988 and 1989, two-door coupes and a convertible were produced, and the '88 model was called the \"Silver Year\" as it marked the 25th anniversary of the namesake. In 1989, Cafaro decided to build a four-door sedan after losing confidence in the two-door coupe. The public was disinterested and only 90 sedans were made total. Soon after, the Youngstown plant closed its doors in 1991 after four years and 405 cars produced. ",
