Ditching the factory mill from the Camaro, a Wegner Motorsports LS3 V8 with 602-horsepower on tap makes for plenty of fun. The intake manifold has been customized so it draws air from the cowl, plus there’s a Bowler TKO Tremec 5-speed manual and Detroit Speed Ford 9-inch rear with posi-traction to round things out. Topping it all off is a Flowmaster exhaust, which terminates at the rear valance, which was custom-fabricated by Ringbrothers."

And of course, there are many custom aluminum parts all over the exterior, interior, and under the hood. Satin green paint with black accents pull everything together."
