He did it as a surprise to his father who was the car's second owner after purchasing it in 1972. The Mercedes was used as a daily driver until 1982 when it was unceremoniously parked in the garage with more than 100,000 miles on the odometer."

It was nice to watch the dusty paint revived back to its bright red hue and the dull chrome given a new shine, and the moldy interior looks impressive as well considering the condition of the surfaces at the beginning of the video. Of course, the best part is watching the man's father see the car out of the garage and cleaned off for the first time in 37 years."
