<hr>
<p>A British Columbia man is lucky to have his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1966-plymouth-fury/">classic car</a> back after it was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-orlando-classic-cars/">stolen</a> from an auto shop it had been dropped off at the day before. The 1965 Chevrolet Impala convertible had been in the shop putting the final touches on a recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1957-chevrolet-corvette-giveaway/">restoration</a>, and it was stolen during the night while the Kelowna, Canada shop was closed. Unlike some stories of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1969-firebird/">stolen classics</a> we've seen lately, it took police less than a day to recover the vehicle.</p>

<p>According to <em>Castanet</em>, the Impala is owned Dean Schnell who took ownership of the car after his close friend passed away seven years ago. This friend had previously owned the car for 15 years, and Schnell has spent the last five years restoring the car to its current condition, which judging by the single picture is quite impressive. The car was recently listed for sale, and it was heading to the shop for one final repair to fix a leaking transmission.</p>
<p>Less than 12 hours after being reported stolen, the Impala had been located by police about a mile away from where it was taken. Police found the car with items in the back seat that didn't belong to the owner including sleeping bags and drug paraphernalia. Schnell thinks that whoever stole may have gotten scared and hastily dumped due to the car's coverage on social media, but it's also just as likely that someone had illegally taken the car for a joyride. Either way, we're glad to hear that the car was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1969-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-crashed-recovered/">recovered without any damage</a>.</p>
