Most race cars are purpose built for a specific type of competition, but try telling that to the Big Red Camaro. It was originally intended to be a road race car, and beat out Ferraris and Mustangs when it won the La Carrera Classic - and also earning itself a ban from the race for being ‘too quick’. But Big Red wasn’t held down as there were plenty of other events to compete in, like the Silver State Classic where it became the record holder with an average speed of 198 mph."

A year later, the iconic Camaro was back and better than ever. It would find its redemption when it would go on to complete the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb."
