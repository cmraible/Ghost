It’s good to just be able to pick this up when you have a bit of free time to kill and then put it down when you’re busy again with no real concern with causing any issues with the game. This is helped with the day night cycle being functionally static as you move around the world. The only way to trigger the change of time is to fall asleep in your bed to recover a sliver of energy and start more work in the evening."
