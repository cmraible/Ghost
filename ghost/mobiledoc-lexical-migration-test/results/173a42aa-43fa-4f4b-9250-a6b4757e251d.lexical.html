<hr>
<p>It’s always satisfying to see a classic car get rescued after it’s been parked for years, which is exactly what happened to this 1962 Chevrolet Impala 2-door hardtop. The thing has been sitting for over 15 years, but it wasn’t left in some damp barn with animals nesting in it, so that’s nice. Iowa Classic Cars bought this and gracious has shared a walkaround as well as a first drive in over 15 years.</p>

<p>Funny enough, the brakes on the ’62 Impala don’t work, but they take it for a spin around the farm where it was stored anyway. It’s a little sketchy but also fun.</p>

<p>You get to hear that 327 V8 fire right up and run like a champ. There’s also a 4-speed manual transmission, something we see far too few of in modern cars. Yes, this car does wear the SS badges but someone added those. That’s the thing when dealing with vehicles which have been modified over the years, you can’t necessarily identify them as you would something which is straight out of the factory. After all, some people decide the bumpers, grille, or even the front clip from a different model year suits their taste better, so they make the swap.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting the Impala was painted turquoise in the factory, so it’s not entirely original. Still, it looks nice enough, especially after having sat for all those years. The green paint it wears now does look pretty nice, but this Impala definitely needs some attention to bring it back to its full glory.</p>

<p>Originally, the interior was also turquoise, matching the exterior. Someone at one point installed blue bucket seats and a black dash, a combination which looks weird. Other details are incorrect like the shifter, plus there are wires hanging out of the dash, damage on the driver’s seat, and other issues which need to be addressed. This looks like a fun project car which could turn out fantastic in the end.</p>
