In early 2017, I quit my job as an electronics salesman to work for my older brother Cory at his digital marketing start-up business. A few months later and I thought that decision was the worst one I could have possibly made as Cory said with tears in his eyes that things weren't progressing the way he had hoped and could no longer keep me on. I was unemployed, without hope and nothing to show for myself other than two-thirds of an Arts degree majoring in English (which surely employers everywhere would've been gushing over, right?). "

I applied for anything and everything for the sake of simply pulling in some income whilst Rachelle was working full-time just so we could continue to pay rent. The site allowed a limit of fifty jobs per day that you could apply for and in that first day, I had filled that quota by lunch time. Even though I thrusted my name forward for countless writing jobs, I found myself taking a lot more thought and consideration when it came to applying for video game websites. By midnight, I had received a grand total of zero responses. I was disheartened but considering my lack of experience, I couldn't blame the employers for not wanting to risk their voice being handled by someone with next-to-no experience like myself. I was so down on myself that I didn't apply for any jobs for days afterward, despite Rachelle sending me applications on her lunch breaks. I felt worthless as I sat on my couch with a controller in my hand (by default) until my phone vibrated. There, at the very top of my screen, was the Upwork logo. My shaking fingers scrolled the notifications down from the very top of the screen and there it said, \"Your application has been approved\". "

Some writers have come and gone but there will always be a place for them at Switchaboo. Rachelle has stuck with me throughout the entire journey and has even contributed to the website with reviews of her own."

As we attempted to bolster our Twitter following, Switchaboo began talking to another gaming website called The Cross Button based in England. When the shields that were our respective sites came down, The Cross Button's creator James Troughton and I became good friends through our mutual interests in writing and video games. James no longer wanted to manage The Cross Button, so he came on board at Switchaboo and has been a valuable co-worker and friend since. "

We have made some lifelong friends along the way and we can't wait to make even more in the years to come."
