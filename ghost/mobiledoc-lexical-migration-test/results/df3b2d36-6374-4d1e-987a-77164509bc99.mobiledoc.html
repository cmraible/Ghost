<p>Last week, <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> reporters <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-bait-and-switch-on-pre-existing/">broke open the story</a> of how Senate Republicans’ bill purporting to protect preexisting conditions actually helps insurance companies gut health care protections.</p>
<p>Last night, that story took center stage in one of the country’s most important Senate races, as Georgia’s incumbent GOP Sen. David Perdue was obliterated for the bait-and-switch during a televised debate. <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1321829044506173443?s=20">Watch the clip here</a> — it has now been viewed more than 6 million times.</p>
<p>This is the kind of follow-the-money reporting we do — and we are only able to do it because we are grassroots funded, which means we don’t have to worry about corporate- or billionaire interference. So here’s my request:</p>
<p><strong>Can you <a href="#/portal/signup">click here</a> to become a supporting subscriber to help us hire more reporters to do this work?</strong></p>
<p>If every free subscriber who gets this email pitches in to become a $5-a-month or $50-a-year subscriber, we can build an entire newsroom to hold politicians accountable every day in 2021. Think about what we could accomplish if we had that. It would be epic — and if you’ve read our work, you know that we hold both parties accountable.</p>
<p>When you become a subscriber, you get a bunch of subscriber-only content — including access to our live events like the one we are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/save-the-date-election-eve-with-sirota/">holding with Naomi Klein this Monday</a> on the eve of the election.</p>
<p><strong>Please <a href="#/portal/signup">click here to pitch in</a>, join our team and help us build this newsroom.</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 6 months, we have shown that grassroots-funded journalism can have a major impact. That journalism is going to be even more important than ever after the election, because Congress and a new presidential administration will need to be held accountable. With your help, we can grow our team to meet that challenge.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
<p>P.S. The Georgia race was not the only place where our reporting popped up this week. <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> separate corruption investigation this week made waves in one of the closest U.S. House races in the country. <a href="https://twitter.com/LuluForTexas/status/1321091833049550856?s=2">Check it out here</a> — that’s the kind of hard-hitting reporting that your subscription will fund.</p>
