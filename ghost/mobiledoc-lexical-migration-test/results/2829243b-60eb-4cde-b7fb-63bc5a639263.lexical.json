However, one little peek inside the engine bay will tell you a different story, and we're glad to share that tale with you. Essentially, the thought process behind this build was simple, they wanted to make something that would be elegant but fast with a hint of modern style. That's exactly what they did too with all of the performance you might only expect from a modern sports car and good-looks to match.",

Around 560 horsepower flows through the drivetrain of this automotive masterpiece making it a ridiculously fast car and a scary opponent on any racing track. All of this comes from the hard work only a true enthusiast and lover of all things automotive could do which makes it perfect for daily driving and racing. ",
