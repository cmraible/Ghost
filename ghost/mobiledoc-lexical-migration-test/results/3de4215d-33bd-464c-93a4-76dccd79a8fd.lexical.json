While many find them to be a bright spot in a largely dull car scene in the 1980s, others think they’re ugly and long overstayed their time in the Ford lineup. We don’t expect those in the latter camp will be much impressed by this turbocharged 1984 ‘Stang even though it pushes a mighty 800-horsepower and that’s okay because the world of automotive enthusiasm is big enough for all kinds of tastes.",
