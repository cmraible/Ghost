<p>Are internal engagement algorithms dumbing down journalism? That seems to be the thesis of a piece by Russell Smith, a former columnist on Canada's <em>Globe and Mail</em>. He blames internal engagement metrics for the demise of his column. </p>

<p>The nub of his argument is that the paper's enagagement team promote pieces that do well, and ignore those that don't. </p>
<blockquote>In practice, this ensures the less read become even less read. It creates what one might call popularity polarization: a few pieces rise to the top, leaving the rest to fend for themselves. With print, this didn‚Äôt happen as much. Flipping pages, you would see every article somewhere. But, on your phone, you scroll through what‚Äôs been selected for you. </blockquote>
<p>I know I'm supposed to tut and shake my head at this. But I can't bring myself to do it. In fact, I might have sprained my right eye due to the number of times it rolled while I was reading the piece. </p>
<p>There are two rather obvious objections to his argument. What he's actually complaining about is <em>poorly-used</em> engagement metrics, rather than their existence, something he doesn't seem to grasp. They can just as easily be used to identfy poorly-performing but worthy pieces that could be earmarked for greater promotion. That's what a skilled engagement team should take pride in doing. </p>
<p>There comes a point though, when it is quite justifiable to say ‚Äúthis audience isn't worth what we're paying you‚Äù. And boy, were they paying him. </p>
<h3 id="the-columnists-expensive-lament">The columnists' expensive lament</h3>
<p>I find it remarkably hard to find sympathy for the writer when I read this:</p>
<blockquote>I had no contract, no security. I was invoicing every week for $800. My editor at that time, Andrew Gorham, told me that I had to take a pay cut of $100 per week. I was spending a day on the column and filling the rest of the week with other freelance work to pay my rent. I could take it or leave it. I took it.</blockquote>
<p>So‚Ä¶ he was earning $3,200 for <em>four days'</em> work? Many journalists are lucky to earn that a month, especially freelancers. There are certainly many, many journalists out there living on less that the $38,400 he was pulling in annually for less than a week's work a month. </p>
<p>(If anyone wants to pay me that for a weekly column, <a href="mailto:adam@onemanandhisblog.com">here's my email address</a>. I promise not to complain about engagement metrics.)</p>
<p>So, yes, I do think it's fair that his employers sought a return on that investment in terms of engagement. And if that means following an editor's direction, well, that's the price of entry. As a former editor, I must admit this paragraph riled me:</p>
<blockquote>My editor relented and allow me to expand my scope and cover varied arts subjects‚Äîas long as they were Canadian. According to Sophi, Canadian subjects got the most engagement. Maybe so, but the issues I was interested in‚Äîthe influence of technology on art or the echoing of long-vanished art schools‚Äîwere mostly playing out on an international stage; I couldn‚Äôt find enough examples of these things from Canada alone.</blockquote>
<p>There's no reason a commercial publication needs to induldge his desire to write whatever he likes. If he wants to do so, well, that's what a blog, Substack or Medium account is for. He can get the small, high-influence audience he craves to fund that directly. </p>
<p>Mainstream journalism is struggling to fund itself enough. Indulging the whims of highly-paid columnists, catering to a terribly niche audience, is unlikely to help matters. Understanding and engaging with audiences <em>is, </em>and engagement metrics are critical to that. Self-indulgent laments like this undermine the vital role metrics play in strategic planning, if used with due sophistication. </p>

<p>It's very easy to get sucked into writing about Facebook all the damn time, and I do try to resist the urge. But this piece of reporting from Buzzfeed is worth a link and your time to read it. Be warned: it is not a pleasant or comfortable read. </p>

<p>Depressing though this piece is, it's not in any way <em>surprising. </em>People have been writing about the harm Facebook and its products are having on the politics of countries worldwide for <em>years</em> now, but still it continues. For example:</p>

<p>Increasingly, there seems to be a strong moral imperative to try and take audience relationships we develop with people on Facebook platforms, and find ways of shifting them to owned and operated channels. </p>
<h3 id="quitting-facebook">Quitting Facebook</h3>
<p>Leaving aside the business angle, it is very, very hard to read those articles without feeling that you should personally withdraw completely from Facebook specifically, and quite possibly Facebook products in general. I'm not in a position to do it completely, for professional reasons, but there certainly is part of me that wants to minimise personal use, to reduce my contribution to the company's network effects. </p>
<p>Manton Reece is proposing Americans leave these platforms until after the US elections:</p>

<p>Others have managed to quit. There are some interesting insights in what the impact of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-been-a-year-since-i-defriended-facebook/">withdrawing from Facebook</a> had for one writer:</p>
<blockquote>Leaving Facebook confirmed my sense that many of the "friendships" on Facebook are the relationship equivalent of junk food. They're easy to obtain and quickly digested, but they're not very nourishing.</blockquote>
<p>I can't help feeling that he cheated, though. He uses his wife as his Facebook secretary, an option that's not available to me. It's exactly the role I play for my wife. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>It looks increasingly like Facebook is unwilling to change its ways. It wants all of the money ‚Äî and the power ‚Äî but none of the responsibility. Zuckerberg has control of the structure of the company, so activist shareholders are unlikely to be able to change this.</p>
<p>So that leaves government regulation. But, when Facebook is proving so very handy for politicans, where's the incentive? </p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I do feel increasingly guilty about my (very small) role in helping Facebook become so central to national debates. </p>
