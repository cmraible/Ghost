For example, the 2018 Hot Wheels Club Original 16 Display Set sold out completely just 9 minutes after it was available to order. Different cars from the set now sell for hundreds of dollars each. Even more amazing, the 2020 Hot Wheels Club Master Set sold out in 2 minutes. To get your hands on the set now will run you over $1,000. It’s the same story for a lot of the individual vehicle drops available to Red Line Club members, making it well worth the effort and expense to join if you’re serious about taking your collection to the next level.",
