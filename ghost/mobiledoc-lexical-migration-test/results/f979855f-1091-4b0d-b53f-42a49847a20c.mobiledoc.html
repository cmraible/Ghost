<p>New York lawmakers this morning sent a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqxubtdfejdfypw/Letter%20to%20governor%20re%20book%20contract.pdf?dl=0">letter</a> demanding Gov. Andrew Cuomo stop hiding the financial terms of his latest book deal ― and they raised questions about whether the agreement intertwined with the Cuomo administration’s decision to withhold damning information about nursing home deaths in the state.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is not Cuomo’s first problematic book deal. A few years ago, Cuomo <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/book-deal-andrew-cuomo-backed-bills-helped-news-corporation-1827328">supported legislation</a> that benefited the mass media company News Corporation, whose subsidiary then gave him a lucrative advance for his first book. After that book was published, Cuomo’s administration also <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/news-corporation-gets-taxpayer-support-after-giving-andrew-cuomo-big-book-deal">backed</a> special tax subsidies for News Corporation.</p>
