In this case, the Cadillac wagon was owned by an Evel Knievel museum located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. That museum unfortunately had to close down, so it’s been liquidating its many assets. Depending on your perspective, the person who submitted the high bid got a screaming deal or paid too much for an old Caddie."
