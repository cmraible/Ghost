<p>If you’re a fan of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/japanese-collector-cars">Japanese cars</a>, and even classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">cars</a> from other areas of the world, one of the best way to experience them is on the actual island of Japan. Not everyone can do that for various reasons, but the power of the internet helps bring the experience to wherever you are. In the video below, we get a nice view of some of the amazing rides kept at the Megaweb <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Toyota">Toyota</a> City Showcase, which is essentially Disneyland for motorheads.</p>

<p>There are plenty of amazing vehicles on display, including a Toyota 2000GT. If you haven’t seen one in person, it’s quite the beauty. While Nissan might not have been a fan of the design from Yamaha, Toyota certainly saw the potential in the simple lines, long hood, and those iconic taillights.</p>
<p>Not only can you ogle all the amazing, rare cars kept in this facility, you can drive some. There’s a 1.3 km driving course designed for test drives. There’s also a section for mini car driving and one dedicated to race track simulation driving, so you’re doing more than just looking and not touching.</p>
<p>Other JDM classics are proudly displayed, like a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Nissan/Skyline">Nissan Skyline</a>, Mazda RX-2, Toyota Soarer, Nissan Fairlady, and more. There are other details like inscriptions in the walls straight out of Shakespeare’s plays, only with car names inserted here and there.</p>
<p>Not all the cars are JDM. In the video you see a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Lotus">Lotus</a> Elan S4<a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ferrari/Dino">, Ferrari Dino</a> 246 GTS, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Impala">Chevrolet Impala</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/BMW/Isetta">BMW Isetta</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Volkswagen/Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a>, DeLorean, and other non-Japanese vehicles.</p>
<p>All of the cars on display are restored by Toyota mechanics in lower rooms of the facility. The fact they’re preserving car history, not just the brand’s history, is inspiring.</p>
<p>To visit the Megaweb Toyota City Showcase, you’ll have to head to Tokyo in Palette Town, which is in Odaiba. Don’t worry about not being fluent in Japanese, because they have guide booklets in English and many other languages, almost like Toyota realizes car fans come from all over.</p>
