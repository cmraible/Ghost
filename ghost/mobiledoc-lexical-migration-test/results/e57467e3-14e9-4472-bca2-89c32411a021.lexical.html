<p>For an agonisingly long time, should you have wanted a true road-going warrior, your only option was to join the Armed Forces. Even then, the Humvee left a lot to be desired. In the same fashion, when tackling crime-ridden Detroit with any degree of success, you had to be Alex Murphy with <em>RoboCop</em> add-ons. Well, here we have the perfect hybrid of the two.</p>

<p>Meet the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164092/2012-terradyne-gurkha">2012 Terradyne Gurkha</a>. While such a name may sound like a box of express painkillers, this is the ultimate road-legal tank. For $275k, you can acquire one of only two examples built with Level 7 Ballistic and 50-cal armoured protection.</p>

<p>There are only 17k miles on the clock, too, with the 6.7-liter V8 Turbo Diesel unit offering 330bhp and 750 lb-ft of torque through an automatic transmission. <br><br>Before you balk at the cost, it’s worth remembering that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164092/2012-terradyne-gurkha">this example</a> held a factory MSRP of $699k. Not only do you, therefore, save a whopping $424k, but you also bag a legitimate film star. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164092/2012-terradyne-gurkha">This 2012 Terradyne</a> appeared throughout the 2014 remake of <em>RoboCop</em>.</p>

<p>Built upon a 2012 Ford F550 XL 4x4 chassis, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164092/2012-terradyne-gurkha">this Gurkha</a> offers all the protection of an <em>OmniCorp</em> entourage, but with added air conditioning, Continental MTP 81 All-Terrain Run Flat tires, door and rear flank-mounted gun ports, remote controlled roof-mounted searchlights, an ear-piercing siren, PA system, back-up camera, and 16.5 ti Warn front winch. Very little is going to stop you when the going gets rough. <br><br>To go with the installed defensive aspects, the Gurkha boasts a striking Matte Tan exterior that’s sure to turn heads. Wearing the highest level of armour that Terradyne currently offers, the body is shaped from ballistic steel for ultimate protection. At present, the frame bears no dents or damage. The only note that the advert refers to concerns a couple of very small paint chips around the bolts on the rear doors.</p>

<p>What we have noticed is that the current paint scheme doesn’t match the dark coating worn on screen. We can only assume that the Gurkha has therefore been resprayed, or wore decals during filming for <em>RoboCop</em> back in 2013.</p>
<p>The cabin is remarkably similar to a 2012 Ford F550 for obvious reasons – sharing the same dashboard and gray leather seats. However, we don’t know of many stock F550s with all the buttons that this machine displays. Alongside controls for the cool stuff, there’s a Kenwood Touch Screen audio player, and access roof hatch should a hasty escape from the vehicle be required.</p>

<p>The leather-lined tank holds no signs of mechanical ill-health, either. All fluids reside at the levels they should with no evidence of leaks or engine damage. Interested? Get a closer look <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164092/2012-terradyne-gurkha">here</a>.</p>
