That makes getting the dirt which has bonded to it off a problem. However, you’ll see the expertise of Ammo NYC at play, which is what you get when you hire a professional who obsesses over soaps, automotive paints, finishes, etc. for this kind of a job. Most people would just sand the body down and start over, but the guy who saved this Pontiac wants to preserve all that he can."

Jerry Seinfeld is very much in the preservation camp, where rust and discolored paint are worn like badges of honor. Others prefer to not even have a hint of orange peel on their car, wanting it to look better than it did fresh out of the factory."
