Some people seem to not understand even if your ride isn’t swiped, as more are all our insurance rates are increased to cover the costs. If you’ve had your vehicle stolen, you know what a pain it is to file a claim and go through the process of replacing it.

That’s what a woman in the Seattle area is dealing with after her 1967 Ford Mustang was stolen from an auto shop recently.",
