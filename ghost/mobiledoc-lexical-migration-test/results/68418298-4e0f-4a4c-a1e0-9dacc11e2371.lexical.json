I hope subsequent Icons Collections models get a little more daring, but this isn’t too bad for a first try. And sure, there are still plenty of pitfalls the company could fall into, but it might prove all the critics wrong while dancing around them or climbing its way out of one or two. Hopefully this new plan does work, if not simply for the fact life is more interesting having at least one independent, major American motorcycle manufacturer still in the game.",
