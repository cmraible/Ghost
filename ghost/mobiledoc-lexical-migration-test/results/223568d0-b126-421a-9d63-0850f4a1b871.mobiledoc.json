It appears it and Facebook have swapped…\n> \n> — Adam Tinworth (@adders) [December 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/adders/status/806105704155254784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nIt’s interesting isn’t it? Only a few years ago, Google was the enemy because it atomises our content (people find articles through search, not index pages) and provides an alternative front page via Google News – thus, indirectly, making money of four content. And now, all of a sudden Google is an ally, and Facebook is the enemy because FAKE NEWS.\n\nOf course, it’s more complicated than that. [Google has its own fake news problems](https://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2016/12/fake-news-political-propaganda.html), and Facebook is now our dominant traffic source. But the journalism world’s odd whiplash between perceiving tech platforms as friend or enemy – and then back – betrays nothing less than the insecurity we feel about our place in this new world.\n\nIt’s almost like we want a junior partner to guide guys into the digital reality, while failing to realise that *we* are very much the junior partners in this relationship.\n\n\n## Get your digital production right\n\n> [@adamtinworth](https://twitter.com/adamtinworth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Jakob Nielsen's first law of web writing: use a bloody bullet list [pic.twitter.com/SThNK9rvJQ](https://t.co/SThNK9rvJQ)\n> \n> — Robert Andrews (@RobertAndrews) [December 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/RobertAndrews/status/806106421574168576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nIt’s a fair point. If you’re going to make point about how you’re supporting journalists in digital, failing to show decent digital production standards isn’t a great start. And Medium, where the post is hosted, makes it really easy to do.\n\nHere’s the Europe list, as it appears in the article:\n\n> In Europe: Hamburg Media School (strategic partner for DACH region); Deutscher Journalisten Verband (DJV); Studiengang Journalistik, Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt; Technische Universität Dortmund (Prof. Dr. Lobigs); Fjum_forum Journalismus und Medien Wien; Deutsche Journalistenschule (DJS); EPFL Extension School; Le Centre de formation des journalistes (CFJ); City, University of London; Cardiff University; Dublin City University, Future Media and Journalism (FuJo); Master in Journalism — University of Turin, centre de formation des journalistes\n\nAnd here it is properly formatted:\n\n\n## In Europe:\n\n- Hamburg Media School (strategic partner for DACH region);\n- Deutscher Journalisten Verband (DJV);\n- Studiengang Journalistik, Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt;\n- Technische Universität Dortmund (Prof. Dr. Lobigs);\n- Fjum_forum Journalismus und Medien Wien;\n- Deutsche Journalistenschule (DJS);\n- EPFL Extension School;\n- Le Centre de formation des journalistes (CFJ);\n- City, University of London;\n- Cardiff University;\n- Dublin City University,\n- Future Media and Journalism (FuJo);\n- Master in Journalism — University of Turin, centre de formation des journalistes\n\nThat was less than a minute’s work (editing using Markdown in WordPress).\n\nAttention to detail on production isn’t just pedantry, it’s paying a fundamental respect to the idea of making the copy more usable for the reader. And it’s certainly a LOT easier to browse that list in the second format.\n\n\n"
