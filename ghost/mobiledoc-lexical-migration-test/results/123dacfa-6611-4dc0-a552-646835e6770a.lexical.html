<h2 id="the-membership-guide-launches">The Membership Guide launches</h2>
<p>This is the big news of the week, but it's somewhat telling how (comparatively) little discussion I've seen of it so far on journo Twitter. Because of the nature of what I do, it's easy to forget that the idea of engaged, member-supported journalism is still far from mainstream in the publishing world.</p>
<p>I've not yet had time to do a deep dive on the guide myself, so expect that in the next week or so, but my first impression is that this is a hugely valuable contribution of ideas and experience to the debate.</p>
<p>If you've had a chance to look at it, and have some thoughts on it, I'd <a href="mailto:adam@onemanandhisblog.com">love to hear them</a>. </p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-membership-and-subscription">What's the difference between membership and subscription? </h3>
<p>A thoughtful piece from Jay Rosen, spinning off from the launch of <em>The Membership Guide</em>, which explores — conceptually and financially — the differences between membership models and subscription models.</p>
<p>There's a tendency to use the two phrases interchangably in journalism circles. This is a good argument as to why that shouldn't be the case. </p>

<p>Another good piece from Charlie Beckett at the LSE, looking at the challenges still ahead for journalism, and also the opportunities inherent in this moment of pause and enforced evolution the pandemic has gifted us. </p>

<h2 id="threat-modelling">Threat Modelling</h2>
<p>Jay Rosen <em>again</em> — there's a man having a productive week — in a discussion about the need for newsrooms to have threat modelling operations. It's been well over a decade since I first saw a targeted cyber-attack on a title I was working with, and the threats have only grown in the years since.</p>
<p>If your business depends on digital, and your prominence is (a) global or (b) political, you <em>need</em> to be thinking about this. </p>
