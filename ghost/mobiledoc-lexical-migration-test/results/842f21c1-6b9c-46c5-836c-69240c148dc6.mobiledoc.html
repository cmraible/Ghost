<p>The <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1980-Chevy-Camaro/lotInformation/62031861">second-gen Camaro</a> went through a lot of changes during the (just over a) decade, and it was a very distinctly different car than the first-generation. The car got longer, lower, and wider, and has become a favorite for many <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1980-Chevy-Camaro/lotInformation/62031861">Chevy enthusiasts. </a></p>

<p>If you're looking to <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/1980-Chevy-Camaro/lotInformation/62031861">add a second-generation Camaro</a> to your collection, this is the example you need. With only 86,694 miles on the clock, this aggressive f-body has plenty of fight left in it. The 350 cubic inch engine is back by an automatic transmission. A personal favorite about this is it being a t-top car, which is one of the best things about owning an f-body. It also has the Z28 callouts throughout and is show ready.</p>
