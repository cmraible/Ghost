<p><strong>C1 (1952-1962)</strong></p>
<p>It's always cool to see C1 Corvettes as this generation evolved from a low-volume roadster to true American sports car over nine years. There are a pair of 1954 'Vettes that will be up for grabs including one that underwent a <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DNMBP/1954-chevrolet-corvette-convertible">concours-level frame-off restoration</a> as well as a pair of 283-cubic '61 'Vettes, but the highlight of these C1s is the gorgeous <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8LI/1962-chevrolet-corvette-327-convertible">1962 Corvette packing a fuel-injected 327 cubic-inch V8</a>.</p>

<p><strong>C2 (1963-1967)</strong></p>
<p>The market for C2 Corvettes is hotter than ever, and these five examples show how much value these cars hold. With the exception of the <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8M6/1966-chevrolet-corvette-convertible">1966 LS-powered restomod</a>, all of these mid-year 'Vettes are expected to hammer for well over six figures including the trio if factory 427 V8 cars, which are all award winners including two with NCRS Top Flight and Bloomington Gold credits to their name. The <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8LU/1967-chevrolet-corvette-convertible">1967 Corvette</a> pictured above is one of these 427s, and it shows well in its rare color combination with Ermine White with a white hard top, blue soft top, blue interior.</p>

<p><strong>C3 (1968-1982)</strong></p>
<p>If you're looking for a classic Corvette on a budget, the C3 is probably the way to go. The C3 Corvettes that will be up for auction include a <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8KI/1968-chevrolet-corvette">numbers-matching 1968 convertible</a> with a 327 and a hard top, while the <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8KU/1974-chevrolet-corvette-convertible">1974 big-block</a> stands as the second to last year for the Corvette convertible until 1986. The most valuable of these C2s is the <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8LK/1969-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-convertible">1969 numbers-matching Corvette with a 427</a>, which is expected to auction for up to $100,000.</p>

<p><strong>C4 (1984-1996)</strong></p>
<p>Starting with the C4 generation, Indy 500 pace cars started to become increasingly more common special editions of the Corvette, and this was the case in 1986 and 1995. Chevrolet only made 732 examples of this <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8KE/1986-chevrolet-corvette-indianapolis-500-pace-car">yellow Indy 500 pace car</a> in 1986, and only 527 pace cars in 1995; <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8KQ/1995-chevrolet-corvette-indianapolis-500-pace-car">this one has just 273 actual miles</a> on it! Rounding out the C4 Corvettes in this auction is the king of the hill â€“ a <a href="https://auction.motorious.com/lots/view/4-DE8KM/1991-chevrolette-corvette-convertible">1991 ZR-1</a> with just 12,000 miles on the odometer.</p>
