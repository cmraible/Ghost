Sounds easy enough but along the way, you can opt to collect three optional sweets which can be used to upgrade abilities in the Hub area. These sweets are often in places slightly off the beaten track and if you click in and hold the left analogue stick, an arrow will appear that points you in the direction of the nearest one; this avoids aimless wandering without shining a beacon on the collectible and simplifying the process. Lastly, for all you speedrunners out there, each level has a trophy to obtain if you reach the end within the suggested time. I only collected a few throughout my playthrough and nothing happened besides a little applause, so I can't say if they actually amount to anything aside from online bragging rights."
