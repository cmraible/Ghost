<h3 id="where-the-real-action-is">Where The Real Action Is</h3>
<p>By Julia Rock</p>
<p>At first glance, it seemed like Washington was simply a stage for political theater last week.</p>
<p>Republicans, holding a new majority in the House of Representatives, voted again and again and again to select the next head of the chamber. Radical Trump loyalists within the party thwarted efforts to crown Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, until early Saturday morning when he finally won the speaker election. It was the longest back-and-forth over electing a speaker since before the U.S. Civil War.</p>
<p>We knew, no matter the outcome, that control of Congress would be split, as Democrats control the Senate and Republicans now have the majority in the House ‚Äî and the real potential for the government to change peoples‚Äô lives in the next two years will likely lie within the executive branch.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>This state of affairs was eminently clear in the first week of the year, as the Biden administration moved to expand abortion access, promote competition in the labor market, and suggested it might move to enforce consumer protection laws against the airline industry.</p>
<p>There are certainly some substantive aspects to the apparent antics in the House. It reveals a lot about how power works in the House ‚Äî with <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-vote-defectors-house-freedom-caucus.html">important lessons for progressives</a>. Involvement from major dark money groups spurred an <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000185-85c8-dde8-a9af-85e929970000&nname=playbook&nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&nrid=cc650b0a-8158-4caf-9c02-91d0351ff0eb&nlid=630318">ethics complaint</a> against McCarthy for using House resources for political purposes. Republicans are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-06/mccarthy-s-emerging-speaker-deal-tees-up-75-billion-defense-cut?srnd=premium">discussing a deal</a> to freeze Pentagon spending in exchange for votes for McCarthy, or to freeze government spending levels altogether.</p>
<p>Most news coverage, however, simply followed the drama of the vote flips and the personalities of radicals attempting to push the party to the right.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>The real developments of any relevance, however, were quietly taking place in the executive branch. For example, as <em>The Lever</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/state-officials-warned-buttigieg-about-airline-mess/">has been actively covering</a>, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been declining to do his job as the country‚Äôs sole airline regulator, while Southwest Airlines screwed over millions of travelers and their families. While most of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-partisan-ghost-in-the-media-machine/">corporate media was refusing to admit</a> that Buttigieg has massive authority to hold Southwest accountable, <em>The Lever</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-how-the-airline-industry-became-a-living-nightmare/">was hammering home this point</a>, and now dozens of lawmakers from Buttigieg‚Äôs own party <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/05/business/southwest-buttigieg-democrats/index.html">have joined the call</a> for the administration to do more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the Speaker fight dominated headlines, the Food and Drug Administration <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-a-regulator-steps-up-to-the-plate/">quietly announced</a> that abortion pills ‚Äî the primary means by which Americans terminate pregnancies ‚Äî can now be offered at retail pharmacies across the country, a massive step towards improving access to reproductive health care following the Supreme Court overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em> last summer.</p>
<p>Days later, the Federal Trade Commission made an announcement that could transform the lives of millions of American workers. The agency has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/business/economy/ftc-noncompete.html">proposed a blanket ban</a> on non-compete agreements, which block workers of all types from switching jobs within industries and ultimately prevent them from negotiating better wages and working conditions.</p>
<p>But this could ‚Äî and should ‚Äî only be the beginning. There are other things executive branch officials could be doing while Congress spins its wheels. <em>The Lever</em> hasn‚Äôt shied away from pointing out how much power the executive branch has to accomplish things like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/xavier-becerra-could-lower-drug-prices-so-why-isnt-he/">lowering drug prices</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-gets-huge-contract-despite-bidens-union-pledge/">helping workers</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazon-benefited-from-bidens-inaction/">trying to unionize</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-biden-and-buttigieg-could-deliver-sick-leave-to-rail-workers/?utm_source=newsletter-email&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=newsletter-article">delivering paid sick leave</a> to workers, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-is-ignoring-an-easy-climate-victory/">tackling climate change</a>.</p>
<p>Congressional theater may be entertaining and garner clicks (although we at <em>The Lever</em> find it mind-numbingly boring), but lift the curtain and you‚Äôll find plenty of powerful regulators and officials who need to be held accountable and do their jobs. We‚Äôll continue telling those stories ‚Äî the ones that actually matter.</p>
