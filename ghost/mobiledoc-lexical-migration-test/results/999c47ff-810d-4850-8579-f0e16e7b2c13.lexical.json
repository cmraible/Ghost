Many enthusiasts count this thing to be at the top of their list of dream cars, making it a valuable piece for any collector, but today we are talking about something that was meant to be driven. That's right, this is a pristine Firebird from what appears to be the year 1967, and after about five years of sitting in a garage, it's ready for the open road once again. But, of course, this is no ordinary run down to the grocery store. Instead, this car will transverse over 1000 miles to arrive home with the new owners. So now let's see how the old car fairs.",

After this setback, it was smooth sailing. After switching passengers with the team who was helping transport another vehicle recently purchased by the pair, the driver averaged around 85 mph. This fantastic Firebird held strong throughout the trip, and now the two owners plan to restore the beauty and use it as a weekend cruiser for family trips. This thing is a beautiful piece of vintage engineering and, through its simplistic design, was able to do what many thought to be impossible.",
