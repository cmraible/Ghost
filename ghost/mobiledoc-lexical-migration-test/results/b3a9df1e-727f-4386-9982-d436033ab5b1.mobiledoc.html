<p>Ferrari has made sure that all of its cars are rare and special in their own light, but some of the cars that will be auctioned off by Rand Luxury Motorcar represent the best of the best when it comes to these Italian supercars. Right off the bat, two fine examples of Ferrari's hypercars – the <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/35/2014-ferrari-laferrari?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2014 LaFerrari</a> and <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/36/2003-ferrari-enzo?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2003 Ferrari Enzo</a> – are the rarest of these cars as well as the most expensive; each is estimated to sell for between $3 million and $3.3 million. The one-owner LaFerrari has just 988 miles on it, and it's one of just 499 of these cars that were ever built.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much to see how pampered these Ferraris are as many don't even have enough miles for an oil change. The <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/14/2017-ferrari-f12-tdf?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2017 Ferrari F12 TDF</a> is the lowest with just 115 miles showing on the odometer, while the <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/63/2017-ferrari-california-t-70th-anniversary-edition?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2017 California T 70th Anniversary Edition</a> isn't far behind with 167 miles; for its age, the <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/40/1963-ferrari-250-swb?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1963 Ferrari 250 SWB</a> has amazingly <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/11-coolest-weirdest-low-mileage-cars/">low miles</a> with just 1,348 actual miles! This group also includes some of the most iconic cars Ferrari has ever made including a <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/56/1985-ferrari-testarossa?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1985 Testarossa</a> and <a href="https://inventory.randluxury.com/vehicles/23/1979-ferrari-308-gtb?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1979 308 GTB</a>.</p>
