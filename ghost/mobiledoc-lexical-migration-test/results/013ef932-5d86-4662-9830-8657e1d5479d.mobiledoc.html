<h4 id="today-s-stat-"><strong>TODAY’S STAT:</strong></h4>
<p>The pandemic and economic crisis have hit low-income people the hardest, while top earners <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/the-wealth-gains-that-made-2020-a-banner-year-for-the-richest-1">have actually</a> seen their wealth increase.</p>
<p>One key reason for this disparity is that low-income people were more likely to lose their jobs or be exposed to COVID-19 due to the fact that less than <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkFed/status/1374001817093345287?s=20">10 percent</a> of low-wage work can be done from home, while the majority of high-wage earners are able to work remotely.</p>
<p>This isn’t just because low-wage sectors are more likely to require in-person work. “Even within sectors, the lowest wage establishments disproportionately suffered the largest losses in employment,” according to a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2021/pdf/ec210020.pdf">new study</a> by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>This chart breaks down the disparities by sector:</p>

<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• NEW YORK SENATE UNANIMOUSLY REPEALS CORPORATE IMMUNITY: </strong>The New York state senate <a href="https://www.wivb.com/news/ny-senate-votes-to-repeal-nursing-home-immunity/">unanimously passed</a> the assembly’s bill to repeal Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s corporate immunity law, which is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/report-fbi-now-probing-cuomos-corporate/">at the heart</a> of the nursing home scandal in the state. Cuomo has <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/state-legislature-immunity-pandemic-1.50193541">not said yet</a> whether he will sign the legislation, which passed with a veto-proof majority. The Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), the lobbying group that drafted the original immunity legislation and a big Cuomo donor, strongly opposes its repeal.</p>
<p><strong>• CUOMO STILL HELPING NY HOSPITAL LOBBY: </strong>In March of last year, Cuomo inserted GNYHA’s liability shield provision into the state budget, granting corporate immunity to nursing home and hospital executives. Now, as the legislature seeks to  repeal that provision, Cuomo is trying to do another favor for GNYHA. Cuomo aides “are quietly advancing a revision to the state insurance law known as ‘pay and pursue,’ which would boost revenue to hospitals at the expense of higher costs for consumers,” according to <a href="https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/cuomo-pushes-budget-change-sought-by-hospital-group/">the Empire Center</a>, a think tank in New York. The change would likely drive up health care premiums and is opposed by major labor groups.</p>
<p><strong>• TREASURY DEPARTMENT RESPONDS TO GOP CRITICISM ON TAX CUT BAN: </strong>The American Rescue Plan included a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/this-last-minute-provision-blocks-gop-govs-using-stimulus-money-subsidize-tax-cuts-1576676">smart provision</a> designed to prevent states and localities from using federal aid to subsidize tax cuts for the rich and corporations. The Treasury Department on March 23 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Response-to-State-Attorneys-General-Inquiries-on-Implementation-of-Section-9901-of-the-ARP-Act.pdf">responded</a> to cries from GOP lawmakers who said that the ban was an illegal infringement on states rights. “If States lower certain taxes but do not use funds under the Act to offset those cuts — for example, by replacing the lost revenue through other means — the limitation in the Act is not implicated,” the department said. It’s not clear how the Treasury Department intends to differentiate between the use of federal aid or “other means” to offset revenue loss, and it won’t be clear until they release their final guidance whether the department intends to strictly enforce the provision.</p>
<p><strong>• ELECTRICITY UTILITIES ARE UNDERMINING THEIR OWN NET-ZERO GOALS: </strong>Every major electric utility in the United States is failing to meet the net-zero goals laid out by the Paris Agreement when it comes to investments and political engagements, according to a <a href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org/investors-utility-decarbonization/">new study</a> undertaken by major investors. The findings are significant, because utilities are <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-your-boring-utility-bill-is-much-more-important-tha-1846454380">key players</a> in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Requiring these utilities to disclose political spending could help fight the climate crisis, as <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/exposing-corporate-climate-denial/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>• BIDEN NEEDS TO FIRE TRUMP’S SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSIONERS: </strong>Two people selected by former President Donald Trump to run the Social Security Administration, Andrew Saul and David Black, are <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/social-security-stimulus-payments-holdup-irs_n_605bae35c5b6531eed018de9">holding up</a> the $1,400 survival checks set to go to nearly 30 million people who receive Social Security benefits by so far failing to provide these people’s payment information to the Internal Revenue Service. Sen. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1375088535921963008?s=20">Sherrod Brown</a><a href="https://twitter.com/SSWorks/status/1375120609571659778?s=20">and</a><a href="https://twitter.com/revolvingdoorDC/status/1375123508481695744?s=20">others</a> are calling on Biden to fire Saul and Black, but his administration has so far allowed them to keep their jobs and hold the survival checks hostage.</p>
