<p>Friends:</p>
<p>On June 1, <em>The Lever</em> will launch our flagship weekly podcast, <em><strong>Lever Time</strong></em>, hosted by me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf6YCLBzJdQ">Click here</a> to check out our brand-new trailer.</p>
<p><strong>As a paid subscriber, you will automatically receive the premium version of the podcast, which will <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-premium/"><strong>also be on our website here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Lever Time Premium will feature reporting from <em>The Lever</em>’s newsroom, high-profile guest interviews, expert analysis from the sharpest minds in media, and biting political comedy. The premium version will include all sorts of bonus content as well, exclusively for our paying subscribers.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Later today, you will receive a separate email with instructions for subscribing to <em>Lever Time Premium</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This email will come from Transistor, which is our podcast hosting service. Be on the lookout for it in your inbox. Once you receive the email, follow the instructions to subscribe. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you don’t receive the Transistor email by June 1st, or if you have any issues subscribing, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@levernews.com"><strong>support@levernews.com</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Please know that nothing about our commitment to you, our supporting subscribers, will change. You will still continue to receive our original reporting every day in your inbox, plus exclusive features like Cheat Sheet, You Love To See It, and Lever Weekly. This is simply the next step in our efforts to build an independent news outlet that can compete with corporate media.</p>
<p>We truly couldn’t do our work without your support, so from the entire <em>Lever </em>team: Thank you.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
