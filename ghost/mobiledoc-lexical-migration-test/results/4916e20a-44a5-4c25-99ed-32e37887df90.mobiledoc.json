          "To those who don’t ever visit drag strips, a go-fast pickup truck sounds downright stupid. However, there are quite a few of them out there and they can be plenty competitive. Even among drag trucks, this Dodge called Lunch Money is special. That’s why Shawn Davis of YouTube channel AutotopiaLA had to check it out for himself. Also, Lunch Money’s owner, Corey, beat Davis’ brother’s Ford GT on "

Sure, you’re not going to be driving it to Home Depot and loading up sheets of plywood in the payload. This truck was built to be driven hard and Corey definitely makes a practice of doing just that."

Since the purpose of this truck is to make it down the drag strip as quickly as possible, that just doesn’t matter. Up front is a 388ci LS V8, and we know everyone swaps in an LS but there are some good reasons for that. However, Corey says there are no GM parts in the engine, so he didn’t take the easy route with this build."
