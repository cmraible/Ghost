<p>This RS will demand attention wherever it goes, especially with that stunning Torch Red exterior. The car has one repaint job, which the ad presumes is most likely from GM’s paint recall in the mid ‘90s. You can’t even tell; it looks as good as new!</p>

<p>This Camaro has never been in an accident, which is easily verifiable through Carfax and Autocheck. The tires are supple, and the wheels have no curb rash whatsoever! The lights are not hazy and contain no cracks in them. The truth is that this vehicle is in excellent condition. Not only is the outside impeccable, but the Grey cloth interior is admirable as well. The seats and carpet are virtually like new and show almost no wear and tear. All aspects and features work; the air blows cold, the radio sounds pristine, and the locks work without issue.</p>
<p>Moving on to the most important part of the car: the mechanics. This 1991 Camaro RS may be almost three decades old, but it runs like a dream. The car is bone stock and has never been raced or modified in any way. The engine runs as strongly and smoothly as it did right off the dealer lot. The transmission is tight and precise, with responsive steering that holds its weight on the road for a quality ride. To boot, the oil was just changed and a mechanic has inspected the car to a T.</p>
<p>The convertible is located in Scottsdale, Arizona with just 27,000 original “box A” miles. We don’t have to tell you twice, especially if you are a Camaro enthusiast or collector. This red hot ‘vert will certainly be a nice addition to your garage and only increase in value as the years go by. It’s a quick ride and a fun one at that. Don’t miss your opportunity to get your hands on this American beauty. Bids are currently underway.</p>
