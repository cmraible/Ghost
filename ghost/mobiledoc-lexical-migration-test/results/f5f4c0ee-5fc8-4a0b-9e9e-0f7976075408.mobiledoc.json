Its rear-mounted 1.6-liter engine has been well preserved, as has its spartan interior. The orange paintwork is original, but more impressively, so are the wooden duckboards on the floor. It even comes with its original tool kit and owners manual."

          "The Volkswagen Thing was sold in Germany as the Kurierwagen and  as the Trekker for a brief spell in the UK. It was originally designed to be a cheap method of troop transport for NATO called the Type 181, but Volkswagen also saw its potential as a more rugged model in its lineup. This affordable yet hardy machine went on sale in America in 1972, however, it was discontinued in 1975 due to stricter DOT safety regulations it could not meet."

The VW sports all of the utilitarian features that it did from the factory including, a removable windscreen, removable doors, and a drain plug in the floor. The idea being that this car could be used for commuting during the week, and a beach buggy at the weekend. 18,000 Things were sold in America, but today these German classics are a rare sight."
