<p><strong>Vivaldi</strong> is the web browser of choice here at BestTechie. Vivaldi is fast, secure, easy to use, and works great. It's also based on Chromium, the browser developed by Google and used to build Google Chrome which gives Vivaldi a lot of great features right out of the box.</p>
<p>As you would expect from a modern web browser, Vivaldi supports the latest web standards so every website you visit should appear correctly. Plus, the Vivaldi team is constantly developing Vivaldi and releases updates for it frequently which are automatically installed for you in the background so you can always be assured you’re running the latest and most secure version.</p>

<p>Currently Vivaldi is available on the desktop for macOS, Windows, and Linux. There's also an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vivaldi.browser">Android app</a> for mobile. Unfortunately, there's not yet an iOS version of Vivaldi – but I'm hopeful we'll see one soon. </p>
