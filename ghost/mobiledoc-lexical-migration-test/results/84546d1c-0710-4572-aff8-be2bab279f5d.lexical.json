Of the bunch, the Nova has got to be the leader in that charge to be the best a classic car can get as it has been used by thousands of enthusiasts for everything from autocross to drag racing. But, of course, what's under the hood is just as important as the car itself, and, for most Chevy-loving car enthusiasts, big-block is the only way to go. This car perfectly epitomizes that emphasis on massive displacement engines, which put today's supercharged LS engines in their place by making just as much power naturally aspirated.",

So what started as a good 350 ci V8 commuter now lives on with a badass 502 big-block under the hood. The car is held up by a set of 20\" chrome wheels that stand out among a crowd and go perfectly with the front spoiler, which gives the vehicle a tremendous low slug look.",
