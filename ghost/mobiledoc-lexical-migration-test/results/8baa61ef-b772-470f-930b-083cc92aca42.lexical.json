One of the main things that makes this performance combination possible is the 3.8-liter flat-six which was rated at around 700 horsepower and 553 ft lb of torque from the company backspace Factory. That engine is helped along by a couple of cool options like the extended-range fuel tank, titanium exhaust, an intercooler spray system, and the neat carbon fiber cover that makes the powerhouse look good especially when revving.",

That down force is a definite necessity as the car was made to race with the best, something you'll definitely want to do when you get behind the wheel of this incredible Porsche.
