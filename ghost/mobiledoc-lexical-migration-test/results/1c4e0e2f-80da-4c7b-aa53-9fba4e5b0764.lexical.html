<p><strong>REMINDER:</strong><em>The Daily Poster has our </em>subscriber-only live chat TONIGHT AT 8PM ET with Sirota, former Bernie 2020 co-chair Sen. Nina Turner and Bernie 2020 pollster Ben Tulchin to look at exactly what happened in the 2020 election. Turner will discuss her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/08/working-people-delivered-biden-win-nina-turner/">new Washington Post oped</a> and Tulchin will present new data spotlighting what drove the results of the national election. <em>Details on how to login to the event are below.</em></p>
<p><strong>REQUEST:</strong> We are trying to grow our subscriber base right now, so we are asking our current subscribers to help us spread the word about our work. So if you know 1-5 people who might be interested in participating in tonight’s live cast, please forward them this email with the login information below. They can attend for free — in hopes that they’ll be interested in then becoming a subscriber. It is a cost to us to open up the live casts like this, but we think it’s worth it to try to show other potential subscribers why they should subscribe. Thanks for being a subscriber — and for considering this request!</p>
