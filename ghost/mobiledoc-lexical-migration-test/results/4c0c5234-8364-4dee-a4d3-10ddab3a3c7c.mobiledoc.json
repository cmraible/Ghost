With a reported to cost about $5 million, the project is said to begin in the spring of next year and is slated to open sometime in 2021. The new addition will have over 25,000 square feet of interactive space, and it will feature 3,000 square feet that is ever-changing. That is plenty of room for a quite a few of America's favorite icons. Even more, the exhibit will feature a vintage speed shop, a replica showroom, and, of course, restrooms."
