That’s what makes events like SEMA fun, especially when it comes to an all-new product like the current Ford Bronco. We finally get to see all the cool products which can be used to make these more trail capable."

          "For the 2021 SEMA Show, Ford is having six different builders bring Broncos and Bronco Sports to display. Each one has a different take on how you can play in the outdoors with these vehicles. The one which seems to really have people talking is the Tucci Hot Rods Bronco since it has four tracks instead of tires. That makes playing in the snow this winter a whole different ball game. For this build, Tucci took a 2021 4-door Badlands series Bronco, added Mattracks 88-Series quad tracks, plus a Yakima LockNLoad platform roof rack system for brining along toys, a Ford Licensed Accessories swing gate storage, retractable running boards, Warn winch, and a Rigid lightbar, plus pods and rock lights. Really, it’s quite the setup."

          "RTR’s take on the Bronco is called the Fun-Runner, which was created by Vaughn Gittin Jr.as a dealer package concept. This build is a 2-door Badlands with Fox Performance Elite 2.5 coilovers, fun-haver off-road long-travel suspension kit, Ultimate Dana 44 FDU front axle, fun-haver long-travel spec Ultimate Dana 60 semi-float rear axle, RCV Performance CV axles, performance intake, an RTR and Ford sound par, special graphics, paint protection film, and doorsill plates. A Ford Performance sport exhaust helps add some baritone to the EcoBoost, but we’re curious if there’s any shrillness to it."

          "BDS Suspensions went with a first responder theme using a 2-door Black Diamond series Bronco for getting through rugged trails in an emergency. Among the upgrades is a BDS 4-inch UCA System with Fox 2.5 PES coilovers, BDS rear adjustable control arms and track bar, swaybar disconnect, CrawlTek Revolution bumpers, belly skid plate, front and rear Warn winches, half-truck hardtop, CrawlTek slider steps, ARB TwinAir underhood air compressor, CargoGlide custom CG1000XL slideout tray, plus 37 inch BFGoodrich KM3 tires. It would be great to see how this thing handles some seriously rugged trails."

          "The final non-Bronco Sport build is done by Theresa Contreras, whose work you might have seen on display at SEMA before. She’s the founder of BAJA FORGED Parts and is showing off her skill with a 4-door Outer Banks series Bronco. While it’s supposed to be quite off-road ready, this build also emphasizes modern onboard conveniences like a fridge, premium sound bar, under-floor safe, cargo organizer, and a folding tailgate table. On the rugged side of things are BAJA FORGED bumpers, ICON Vehicle Dynamics 3.0 suspension lift, rock lights, fender flares, and spare tire carrier."

          "Honestly, we don’t care as much about the two Bronco Sport builds because they’re just not that interesting. We’re sure people who’ll use their “off-road” vehicle to go on Jamba Juice runs to make everyone, including themselves, think they lead some rugged lifestyle will disagree."
