<p>“With the same powertrain as one would find in a Judge combined with a more restrained exterior package, this <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/gto?promo=MOTORIOUS34">1969 Ram Air III GTO</a> convertible makes for a sophisticated and very attractive performance machine—it's still very much a head turner but it does so with a more subtle persona." — Don Keefe, founding editor-in-chief of Poncho Perfection magazine and author of the book, “How to Restore Your Pontiac GTO 1964-1974.”</p>
