The challenge, however, comes in needing to end the level with the same colour as the border, which becomes quite challenging as the game progresses. The game is free to download, containing 120 levels, with each additional pack only costing 99c each. So to unlock every level (which there are 460 in total), it would only cost you $2.97.
