Rumors about the Thunderbird nameplate returning have been swirling around for some time, especially in January of 2021 when Ford filed the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office."

Yeah, in other words this a complete rumor. But you have to understand, automakers often times will “leak” rumors to the press as a way to see how people respond. If you all start screaming like teenage girls at a rock concert because of this possibility, Ford might be obliged to give you exactly what you want."

To compete against the Corvette, which is now a more exotic mid-engine sports car, Ford would need to make the Thunderbird something radically different from what it was back in the day, or even what it was last time it graced showroom floors."

After all, the connection between the name and electricity is probably too much for Ford to resist, especially since the Blue Oval seems increasingly obsessed with electrifying all the things."

Then again, this rumor could just be something manufactured by some bored journalists wanting to get some sweet, sweet clicks, especially since the sources are shrouded in secrecy. We might never find out."
