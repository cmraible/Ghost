<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We had some fun on <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs podcast network this week. On <em>Lever Time</em>, David got a full explainer on last week‚Äôs cryptocurrency implosion from two crypto policy experts. If you‚Äôve ever had the thought, ‚ÄúCryptocurrency seems like a giant scam,‚Äù it turns out you were one hundred percent correct. Then, we discussed last week‚Äôs midterm elections, which saw major wins for progressives across the country. In fact, one of our reporters even attended a D.C. event on Sunday welcoming eleven of its new progressive House members. Sadly, <em>The Audit</em> will be taking a break for the next several weeks, as they decompress from watching several hours of George W. Bush lectures.</p>

<p>Rock the boat,</p>
