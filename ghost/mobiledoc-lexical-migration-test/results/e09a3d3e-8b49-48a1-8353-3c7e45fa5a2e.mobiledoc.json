While Georgia, South Carolina, and others have organized gangs of car thieves swiping Dodge Hellcats and Mercedes, Gatorland does one better with twin brothers swiping multiple cars just days apart. This is truly a bizarre story which can only come from one place."

The first incident took place on April 10 when a truck was stolen in Crestview and was recovered in Freeport, about 45 miles away. When Walton County Sheriff’s deputies tracked down the truck, they saw a redheaded guy running away from the area."
