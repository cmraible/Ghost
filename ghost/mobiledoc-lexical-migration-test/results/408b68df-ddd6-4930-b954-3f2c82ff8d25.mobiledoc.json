It looks kind of like those toys little kids play with, only it’s life-size and you can roll around town in it while people stare and literally get into crashes. It’s not everyday you see a 24-foot-long arrow boat joined to a truck, let alone a Chevy."

For reasons we don’t entirely understand, the rest of the “mouth’ is painted onto the hood of the truck so when the boat portion lifts up to let people in or out of this vehicle, it’s exposed."

But our favorite is how even with the front bench seat boosted, the driver still can’t really see ahead, so there’s a camera system to show the road and other vehicles. It all seems very safe and well-planned, yeah that’s it."

His dad used to repair boats, so that’s presumably why he acquired this one which was leaking gas and needed all kinds of repairs. Later, he grabbed the old Chevy truck and parked it under the boat, which was hoisted to the rafters in his garage, which is when he says he got the brilliant idea of making the two one. At least that’s his story and he’s sticking with it."

Plus, his garage has a hot rod sign, so he’s not just some random guy who one day got this off-the-wall idea and just rolled with it."
