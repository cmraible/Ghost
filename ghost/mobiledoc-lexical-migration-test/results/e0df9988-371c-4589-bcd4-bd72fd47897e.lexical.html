<hr>
<p>It’s unique to find a car that’s been with the owner for close to half a century, yet that’s precisely what we have with this <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/38/1966-chevrolet-corvette-coupe?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1966 Chevrolet Corvette</a> being sold through <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike Midwest</a>. Since 1972, this beautiful Ermine White over red leather coupe has been cherished by the same person. What’s more, it’s a numbers-matching car and comes with service records, so it could be just the investment Corvette you’ve always wanted.</p>

<p>This ’66 ‘Vette comes with the 327ci V8 originally installed in the factory along with a 4bbl carb, big intake-valve cylinder heads, hydraulic lifters, and a 2.5-inch diameter dual exhaust. According to General Motors, the engine produces a solid 300-horsepower, making this ride worthy of being called “America’s sports car.”</p>

<p>While that’s certainly power enough to make this C2 a lot of fun, the previous owner decided to go a little further without doing anything too crazy. Bolted onto it are headers, but the OE exhaust manifolds are being included with the sale, if you want to switch back to the stock setup. The 3:73 Positraction differential and a Muncie M-21 four-speed have also been installed. The factory 3-speed manual transmission is also being included in the sale.</p>
<p>Virtually everything else about this car matches what it came with fresh from the factory. One exception is that instead of red vinyl upholstery, the owner had soft Al Knoch red leather installed, making the interior feel far more luxurious. While you see the original controls and AM/FM radio, hidden in the glove box is a modern AM/FM/CD deck which was installed professionally, so it looks great when you open the door.</p>
