Like many automobiles of the time, the front grille is stately while the pontoon front fenders offer some curvaceous appeal. What really makes a statement is that daring boattail rear, communicating the power of this machine."

Thanks to the advanced design of this Auburn, it wowed automotive fans by being able to drive at 100 mph for sustained distances, a feat its competitors couldn’t replicate. A plaque on the dash testifies that this Speedster can hit 100.1 mph. A three-speed syncromesh transmission sends power to the Columbia two-speed rear."
