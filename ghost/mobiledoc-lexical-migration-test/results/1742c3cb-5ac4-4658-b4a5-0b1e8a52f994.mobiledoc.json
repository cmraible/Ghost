They were mildly face-lifted resembling the first two model years, but the changes were different enough to be a separate design for 1970. Featured was a new front end design with a longer hood that had a “power blister” with two large openings. These were a functional cold ram-air induction system with the popular \"Go Package\" available with the 360 and 390 engines. The new grille was flush and full-width incorporating the headlamps. The revised rear end also featured full-width tail lamps and a single center mounted backup light. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. Riding on the same wheelbase 97-inch as before, the changes increased the AMX's overall body length by about two inches to 179 in."

The smallest 290 was dropped and AMC could claim 65 more base horsepower than the AMXs had previously. The 390 V8 engine continued, but upgraded to new heads with 51 cc combustion chambers that gave 325 hp. The code remained \"X\" for the engine on the vehicle identification number (VIN). The \"Go package\" was available with the 360 engine (including power front disc brakes, F70x14 raised white letter tires, handling package, and the ram-air induction system) for $298.85, or including the 390 engine for $383.90."

The exterior rear view mirror featured a new design and in some cases matched the car's body color. The three \"Big Bad\" exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 AMXs, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers.
