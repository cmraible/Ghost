Of course, quite a bit of movie magic was involved to make the motorcycles look like they were doing the impossible. A constant struggle, various fiberglass parts fabricated to make the bikes look different would go flying off during stunts. Those stunt bikes also blew through a lot of OE parts since they were being jumped and pushed well beyond reasonable usage. Some of those Hollywood effects look cheesy in today’s CGI-saturated world, but the crew did the best they could at the time with a small budget. Speaking of stunts, Rex Smith who played Mach did most of his own riding with a stunt double used only for the most dangerous sequences."
