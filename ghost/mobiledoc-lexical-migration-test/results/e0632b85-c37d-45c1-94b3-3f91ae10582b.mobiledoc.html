<p>Not everyone is big on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stream-car-shows/">reality TV</a> and it’s not difficult to see why. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driven-restores-carroll-shelbys-detomaso-pantera/">manufactured drama and overall fakeness</a> of people who just really, really <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/12-celebrities-cars-for-sale/">want to become famous</a> without developing any real talent is a major turn-off. That’s why <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-kings-restores-lil-red-wrecker/">skill-based reality shows</a> are more interesting, like Netflix’s <em>Hyperdrive</em>. If you’re a fan, then you already know Fielding Shredder.</p>
<p>If not, you really should watch the show and get to know the guy that way. For the purpose of this article, know he’s a fan favorite because of his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">all-out, no-holds-barred, high-risk-high-return racing style</a>. The guy has serious guts, but he almost wasn’t a competitor on Hyperdrive, which would’ve been a real shame.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Shredder saw a casting call and answered it, otherwise he wouldn’t have even been on Netflix’s radar. The guy wasn’t well-known, but before he gained fame on <em>Hyperdrive </em>he was competing in Lone Star Drift events. He honed his skills further at the Rally Ranch in Texas, which has courses for each skill level and a nice variety of terrain for some pretty good practice. All that was put to use during the crazy challenges in <em>Hyperdrive</em>.</p>
<p>The video included with this article tells Shredder’s story of getting on <em>Hyperdrive</em> in his own words. Basically, he was persistent and that might have been one of the ways Netflix producers weeded out some people. After all, if you want to win in motorsports you can’t be easily deterred or you probably won’t last long.</p>

<p>Shredder is resourceful and he really wanted to win, so he was able to get info about the competition instead of just giving up and waiting to learn what he and his car would be facing. Still only knowing vaguely what he was dealing with, he made the critical decision to bring a Nissan 240SX S14, which handles well and is very balanced, especially for a rear-wheel-drive setup. The gamble paid off and the rest is history.</p>
