            " introduced in September. The earlier policy ensured the federal government would cover the full cost of state-administered universal pre-k for the program’s first three years. After that, the federal government’s cost obligation would decrease by 10 percent yearly, and it would ultimately cover just 60 percent of the program’s cost in 2028. The current draft significantly pares back the earlier proposal by eliminating the final year of financial support and nixing the federal government’s responsibility to pick up the full tab in the first three years — giving state governors fodder to avoid implementing the program. According to the People’s Policy Project, “For all practical purposes, the universal pre-k bill has been cut in half: the last year was cut entirely and the first three years have such little money appropriated towards them that they basically don’t exist.”"

An analysis of 196 country reports reveals a massive gap between individual nations’ declared and actual greenhouse gas emissions, potentially impacting the type of climate action and goals currently being discussed at COP26. “The gap ranges from at least 8.5 billion to as high as 13.3 billion tons a year of underreported emissions — big enough to move the needle on how much the Earth will warm,” the "

            ". Typically, a person signs a DNR order to prevent resuscitation in the event their breathing or heart stops. While this option works to bypass unnecessary suffering at the end of a person’s life, the study, which examines 20 years of peer-reviewed data from leading medical institutions, finds that patients often agree to a DNR without knowing the order could make hospitals less likely to administer blood tests, IVs, and routine procedures that could extend their life. Signing such a DNR could “makes things go in a direction that we probably didn’t want to happen,” said e7Health CEO Jonathan Baktari, MD. “Our standard way of looking at DNR is appropriate in many cases, but not all.”"
