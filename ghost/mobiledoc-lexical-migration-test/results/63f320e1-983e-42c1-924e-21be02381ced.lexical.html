<hr>
<p>About a year ago a new channel launched on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hellcat-gets-impounded/">YouTube</a>, called simply Restoration. While there are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/social-media-influencers/">many channels</a> on the platform to watch, this one has risen above so many others because of two factors. Unlike so many who seek fame because they want to find <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/youtuber-drives-supercars/">meaning in being liked by droves of people</a>, this YouTuber has an undeniable passion for restoring absolutely thrashed model cars. That intense interest is easily communicated in the videos where time and again the vehicles are made to look like new.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out how Porsche restored one of its most iconic cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-restores-first-911-s-targa/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>That brings us to the second reason why this YouTube channel has stood out: <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-restores-first-911-s-targa/">amazing skills</a>. Instead of just focusing on looking cool, this person has used their passion for model cars to drive them forward, developing skills which are quite impressive. Many of these toys look well beyond repair, so it’s easy to see how someone would give up on them.</p>

<p>It’s not entirely clear where this guy is getting the discarded scale model cars, and maybe that’s a closely-guarded secret of his. But he’s definitely good at doing what’s necessary to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dominic-torettos-dodge-charger/">make them like new</a> or maybe even better than new.</p>

<p>Watching him work to clean up, disassemble, and restore these little cars is interesting. Some find it soothing to just watch him do his thing with the toys. Maybe it’s like ASMR videos for them? With hundreds of thousands of views on many of the channel’s videos and millions on several, it’s obvious many people are finding something interesting enough to spend 15 minutes or so to enjoy.</p>

<p>With some of these model cars, they’re so bad off when the guy presents them, complete with missing pieces, distorted body panels, etc. that many probably think there’s no way they could ever look good again. To see how these vehicles are transformed is inspiring, which might be the biggest draw of all, just like when you see someone restore a real car from a rust bucket to something beautiful and powerful.</p>
