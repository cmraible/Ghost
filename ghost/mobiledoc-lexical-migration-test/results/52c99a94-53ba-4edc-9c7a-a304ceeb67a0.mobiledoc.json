It’s just a thing that seems to happen all the time here in the States, unlike in Europe where it’s BMWs veering towards sidewalks like there’s a magnetic attraction."

To everyone’s surprise, it turns out of the parking lot and onto the public road without incident. The driver doesn’t try doing a burnout or hot dogging it at all, which makes us wonder if they shouldn’t be driving an Accord instead."
