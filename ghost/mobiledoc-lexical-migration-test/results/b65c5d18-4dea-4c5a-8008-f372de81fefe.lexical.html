<p>Being a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles">car</a> enthusiast when you’re not rich and have responsibilities can be tough. This guy in South Carolina is a boat mechanic and father of three, so he’s having to turn to some creative ways to have a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/315501/top-classified-cars-for-sale-this-week">dream car</a>. In the video below he snags a sweet 1974 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche/911%2520Targa">Porsche 911 Targa</a> for just $500. Actually, it’s really rough, and understandably so since it came from a scrap yard. The big question is if doing such a thing is genius or foolish?</p>
<p>Most people would absolutely lose it to find a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjkxMSJdfQ==">Porsche 911</a> of any year, any model for a mere $500. That’s an incredible deal, even if the engine is shot and the interior is non-existent, which isn’t too far off from this ride. Michael Wagner, who made this video and bought the car, has some plans for it like fitting the 911 Targa with a wider body. That should make some of the damage negligible, but he definitely has a long road ahead of him.</p>

<p>Targa models are somewhat controversial among some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche">Porsche</a> enthusiasts. Actually, pretty much everything is controversial among them, including when the brand switched from the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjM1NiJdfQ==">Porsche 356</a> to the 911, or made the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjkyOCJdfQ==">Porsche 928</a>. Still extremely controversial was the switch to water cooling for the Porsche 996, a car abhorred by a surprising number of enthusiasts. And don’t even mention the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImNheWVubmUiXX0=">Porsche Cayenne</a> to some people, unless you want to get an earful and then some.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this Porsche 911 Targa is still a work in progress. The guy has several more videos on his channel detailing the progress, but it’s slow-going since he has a day job and other cars he’s trying to resurrect. Still, there’s a lot he could do with this car, considering it’s pretty much a blank slate at the moment.</p>
