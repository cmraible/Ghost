<p>Remember the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/top-4-dodge-concepts/">Dodge Magnum</a>? When <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-dodge-charger-500-project-car-barn-find-sells-for-bargain/">the Charger</a> first returned in 2006, it was preceded by a pair of pair of cars that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/widebody-challenger-scat-pack/">shared its platform</a> â€“ the luxurious Chrysler 300 and the Dodge Magnum station wagon.</p>

<p>After 2008, the Magnum was dead, and there's little to no hope of it ever returning. That's a shame, because unlike the Charger and the 300, we never got to see the Magnum make the jump from the LX platform to the updated LD platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/widebody-dodge-charger-hellwagon-isn-t-your-average-family-hauler-151785.html">Auto Evolution</a>, one enterprising owner has taken the initiative to add current Charger styling to the Magnum. In addition, they're injecting it with a big heaping helping of Hellcat performance, too.</p>

<p>The car is being built by Dave Nenno, who is using parts of several cars to build his dream machine. Instead of using a Magnum base, he's instead starting with a base model 2015 Challenger and grafting the Magnum roof onto it.</p>
<p>The body has been updated with a whole host of widebody Hellcat accessories, and the drivetrain will be sourced from a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. The end goal is a whopping 1,000 horsepower. Now <em>that's</em> how you haul more than groceries.</p>

<p>You can follow the build on Nenno's YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQgjhCLyUiH6omlZksTtrfA">Junkyard Dave</a>. The car is certainly impressive to say the least, and you definitely won't see another one like it. There's a lot of work invested in this machine.</p>
<p>It's a real shame that station wagons have been supplanted by boring, egg-shaped crossovers in the American automotive marketplace. Unfortunately, we'll probably never get a chance to see the factory build anything this cool. Blame Karen.</p>
