Such cars are undoubtedly beautiful to look at, but the dilapidated condition of this Renault has quite the story behind it. Not everyone can say their vehicle was shredded while filming a big-budget movie."

Where you see this car in the movie is when the two heroes are fleeing to safety, having gotten farther in the Time Loop than they previously had. Obviously, to get so far they had to deal with potent dangers, hence a spectacular chase scene where collateral damage was done, and that’s how this Renault was trashed."

Some people will just see a wrecked vehicle, something suitable for the wrecking yard and nothing more. Fans of Edge of Tomorrow and/or Tom Cruise will see a valuable film prop, something connected to a beloved movie. It’s definitely worthy of displaying in a museum or your own private collection, especially with some posters from Edge of Tomorrow or any other memorabilia you might have. If this isn’t for you, there are plenty of other vehicles which are. But if it is, you can check out the listing on Motorious right here."
