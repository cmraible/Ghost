<hr>
<p>Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine is apparently at least a casual gearhead (remember, he got duped on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/adam-levine-maserati/">classic Maserati purchase</a>, or so he claims) so we’re not horribly surprised the guy bought a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-much-power-does-the-hennessey/">Hennessey</a> VelociRaptor. The rocker has plenty of money, so $80,000-plus for an off-roader he just drives around town like it’s a Toyota Camry is honestly no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Check out what Hennessey has done to the Durango Hellcat <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-pushes-durango-hellcat/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Celebrity gossip website and our personal favorite destination on the interwebs, TMZ, featured photos of the musician in his new ride recently. His Hennessey VelociRaptor is of course all black – trim, wheels, and interior – which would make it look absolutely awful were it to ever be driven in a dusty environment.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware, Hennessey makes a number of modifications to your modern Ford Bronco to create the VelociRaptor 500. Obviously, the name hints at the 500-horsepower output, a significant performance bump along with 550 lb.-ft. of torque. That’s achieved through an EMS upgrade, and high-flow air filtration.</p>

<p>The list of mods doesn’t stop there, with Hennessey adding 37-inch off-road tires, 20-inch wheels, upgraded heat exchanger, front and rear bumpers, WeatherTech floormats, and chassis dyno tuning to make sure everything is ironed out perfectly.</p>
<p>A mere 200 of these are being made for 2023, so Levine is part of that elite group. While he opted for the VelociRaptor 500, there’s also a Heritage Edition available that adds throwback body graphics.</p>
<p>While it’s possible Levine will eventually traverse a dirt road, his VelociRaptor looks absolutely pristine as he was spotted driving down the street in Santa Barbara, California. He also had the top off and windows down, obviously enjoying the nice weather and who can blame him?</p>
