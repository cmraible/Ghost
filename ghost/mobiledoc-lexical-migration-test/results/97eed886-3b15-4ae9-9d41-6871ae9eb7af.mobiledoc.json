While it’s technically the most powerful factory muscle car ever made, it’s also not even close to street-legal, a fact which helps Mopar and Ford enthusiasts save some face. Still, everyone has to admit this thing is a track monster and should be giving the competition hell."

Last year, the top-of-the-line version sold for $105,500. Considering the ZZ632/1000 crate motor has an MSRP of $37,758 it’s likely if you choose that option you’ll be shelling out six figures for the race car."
