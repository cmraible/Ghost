These vehicles will live on as icons of their generation because of their innovative style and high horsepower V8s, but there is one car that many people don't discuss when thinking of the early '60s. You may know the Nova name from the second generation, but the vehicle didn't always boast the curvy design in the late '60s and early '70s. This particular Nova is a remarkable performance automobile that kickstarted the GM domination of compact muscle cars. So what makes this insane vehicle such an excellent purchase for any automotive enthusiast interested in the early Nova?",

That power is then sent through a manual transmission which was likely the best performance combination available in 1967. After all, this Chevy II Nova is an SS model explicitly made for high-speed driving and daily driver applications. That's why you should consider getting behind the wheel of this great muscle car.",
