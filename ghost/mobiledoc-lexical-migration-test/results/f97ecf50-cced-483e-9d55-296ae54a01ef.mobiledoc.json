The company has actually been considering selling off its car collection since 2020. Last year it sold the storied McLaren Technology Centre to a property company based in the US."

The report doesn’t specify which vehicles were sold. At least before, the collection contained dozens of Formula One cars which had been piloted by the likes of Ayrton Senna and Bruce McLaren. Other notable vehicles include the McLaren F1 XP5, a prototype car which set the world land speed record for a production car, and the legendary McLaren Can-Am racers, like the McLaren M8A from the 1968 season."
