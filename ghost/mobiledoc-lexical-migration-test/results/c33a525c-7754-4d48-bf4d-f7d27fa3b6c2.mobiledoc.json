Instead of swapping out the factory engine with something bigger, this 442's numbers-matching engine was rebuilt and upgraded with aftermarket fuel injection and air conditioning. This engine uses a fully custom dual exhaust system that still manages to mount to the factory hangers and use factory outlets, and shifting duty is performed through a four-speed manual transmission â€“ that is what the second \"4\" in 4-4-2 stands for after all! The only major clue that this Oldsmobile has been restomodded is the four-wheel power disc brakes with drilled and slotted rotors that peek out from the period-correct American Racing five-spoke wheels."

The inside is even cleaner with even the smallest detail being refinished for a brand-new look in this 55-year-old muscle car. The original seats were redone for this restoration, but everything looks factory fresh with the crown jewel being the wood-rimmed, three-spoke steering wheel."
