<p><br><strong>A reminder that today at 4pm ET (1pm PT)</strong><strong>we will be hosting our weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em><strong>Lever Live</strong></em></a>. </strong></p>
<p>This week, David Sirota and Andrew Perez are joined by David Dayen, the executive editor of progressive magazine <em>The American Prospect</em>, to discuss the perennial fight over the debt ceiling. This time around, Republicans are again threatening to allow the U.S. to default on its debt so they can get the Biden administration to agree to major cuts to social programs. David and David will discuss the ongoing negotiations while also taking questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
