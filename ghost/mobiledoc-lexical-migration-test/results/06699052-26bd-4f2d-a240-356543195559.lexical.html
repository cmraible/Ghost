<p>It‚Äôs been an exciting week for <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs podcast network. On <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota interviews freshman congresswoman Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska), who made history last year during Alaska‚Äôs U.S. House special election. Not only was Mary the first woman elected to represent Alaska in the House, but she did so by defeating one of the most infamous Alaskan Republicans: Sarah Palin. David and Mary got into the nitty-gritty of Alaska politics, including the state‚Äôs dependency on the oil and gas industry. </p>
<p>On top of that, this past week, <em>The Lever</em> launched its third official podcast: <em>Movies vs. Capitalism</em>, which examines the crucial intersection between pop culture and politics. In the inaugural episode, hosts Rivka Rivera and Frank Cappello are joined by David Sirota for a deep-dive conversation about the Reagan-era classic <em>Ghostbusters</em>. If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and informative movie podcast, this is it. <em>The Audit</em> continues its winter hibernation, so make sure to catch up on the first two mini-seasons in the meantime!</p>

<p>The group breaks down how the film‚Äôs pro-business, anti-government messages are baked into almost every scene, which is extra troubling considering this is a movie which was largely marketed to children. They also dig into the film‚Äôs sexual politics and discuss how Peter Venkman is an absolute creep. </p>
