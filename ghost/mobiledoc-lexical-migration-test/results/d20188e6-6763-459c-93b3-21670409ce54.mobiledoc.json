According to the local report, the wagon was built using parts from an M3 stolen back in September of 2019 from a dealership, plus another M3 stolen in March of 2018. There were parts from two other cars mixed in there, but nothing is said about the other two vehicles having been stolen. Now, it’s possible these guys just bought some stolen parts and didn’t realize their origin – we don’t know. Someone tried removing VINs and serial numbers on the car, but police were able to read them anyway. But that wasn’t the only reason why the car was seized and crushed."
