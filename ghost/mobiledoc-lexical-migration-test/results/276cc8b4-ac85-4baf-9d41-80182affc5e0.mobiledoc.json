All of the Gold, Silver, and Black on and around the engine help to contrast perfectly against the carâ€™s metallic brown and maple exterior finish. The interior boasts tan leather seats and leather upholstery all over the dash, what sticks out most is the chrome shift knob which is connected to a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission. As for wheels, the car sports one of a set of kind wheels which are stopped with the power of Baer brakes and slotted rotors."

There is no doubt, this truly is a cool car."
