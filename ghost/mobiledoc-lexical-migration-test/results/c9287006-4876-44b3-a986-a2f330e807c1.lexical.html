<p>After years of waiting, sport compact enthusiasts in the U.S. could finally rejoice when Honda introduced the Civic Type R in 2018, and this car didn't disappoint. Seeing as how many of these cars were raced, abused and/or modified, though, it's pretty hard to find a responsibly appreciated example like this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/197277/2019-honda-civic-type-r-touring-manual">2019 Honda Civic Type R</a>.</p>

<p>The excitement surrounding this car comes from its 306-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder and enthusiast-minded six-speed manual gearbox, and with less than 9,000 actual miles, this Type R is just barely broken in and still looks like it is brand new. Backing up that peppy engine, the Type R is easy to recognize thanks to its chin spoiler, hood vent and massive rear wing.</p>
<p>Painted in Championship White paint job with contrasting black wheels, this particular Type R is about as subtle as these cars come, but there's still no doubting that this hot hatch means business! Inside, the two-tone interior reveals heavily bolstered racing-inspired seats, aluminum pedals and a sporty gear shifter that backs up the car's exterior looks and shows no signs of wear. Being a Touring trim level, this Civic Type R was optioned up with all the goodies, such as navigation, for improved driving pleasure.</p>
<p>Considering a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2000-honda-civic-si-record-auction-price/">20-year-old Civic Si just sold for more than $50,000</a>, now is a good time to start looking at these late-model Japanese sports cars for what they really are: investment-grade collectibles.
