<p>During this holiday break, <em>The Lever</em> is resurfacing some of our most important efforts of 2022. Today, we focus on the launch of our current lineup of podcasts this year. We will return to our normal publishing schedule in the new year. </p>
<hr>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This has been a truly historic year for <em>The Lever</em>: Our staff has almost doubled in size, we produced more original reporting than ever before, and we launched <em>The Lever</em>’s podcast network.</p>
<p>We began in June with the launch of <em>Lever Time</em>, our flagship podcast hosted by myself. <em>Lever Time</em> has given us the chance to amplify our work to an entirely new audience, bringing our original reporting to podcast players around the world. In just nine short months, we’ve interviewed dozens of journalists, industry experts, entertainers, and politicians. This includes actress Susan Sarandon, Amazon Labor Union president Chris Smalls, MSNBC host Chris Hayes, Planned Parenthood president Alexis McGill-Johnson, famed environmental lawyer Steven Donziger, director Judd Apatow, and U.S. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Brian Schatz.</p>
<p>On <em>Lever Time Premium, </em>the extended version of <em>Lever Time </em>which is exclusively available for supporting subscribers, we produced a variety of bonus segments. That included interviews with climate futurist Alex Steffen, <em>Atomic Days </em>author Joshua Frank, and <em>Petroleum Papers </em>author Geoff Dembicki; a deep-dive on the British monarchy with UK political organizer James Schneider; and our critiques of liberal media in the <em>Pod Is Not Saving America</em> round-ups.</p>
<p>In October, we launched our second podcast, <em>The Audit</em>, hosted by comedian Dave Anthony and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Josh Olson. <em>The Audit</em> is a humorous and informative look at how powerful people attempt to launder their histories and reputations through supposedly educational content. In the duo’s first mini-season, they audited the entirety of President George W. Bush’s MasterClass (and somehow made it out alive). In their current mini-season, the hosts are joined by Senator Nina Turner, and the study group is trudging their way through political consultants David Axelrod and Karl Rove’s joint MasterClass on campaign strategy.</p>
<p>We’re extremely proud of the podcasts we’ve produced this year as <em>The Lever</em> continues to build an alternative to corporate media. If you haven’t gotten a chance yet, learn how to sign up for our podcasts below. Also, keep your eyes peeled in 2023 for some new exciting podcasts as we continue to expand our podcast network.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>

<p>Hosted by comedian and WGA-nominated TV writer Dave Anthony and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Josh Olson, <em>The Audit</em> is an “educational” series in which Dave and Josh audit a variety of online classes, docuseries, and other media products created by noxious political figures and boil them down to the good stuff. By which they mean… the bad stuff. An episode of <em>The Audit</em> is like listening to a book report — except all the authors are deranged lunatics poisoning American culture.</p>
