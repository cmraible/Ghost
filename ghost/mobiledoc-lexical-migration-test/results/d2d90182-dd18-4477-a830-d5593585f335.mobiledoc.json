That’s why this barely fender bender involving a Lamborghini Urus kissing the back end of a Bugatti Chiron Sport 110 Ans is a big deal. The drama factor is even higher because both vehicles are owned by celebrities."

It almost stops all the way before reaching the hypercar, but the German’s front bumper kisses the rear bumper of the Frenchie. The crowd immediately reacts how you would expect, with plenty of hooping and hollering."

The impact was loud enough it might have at least cracked some paint if not panels, but no parts appeared to be hanging off either ride. Still, the crowd which formed to spot any celebrities going in and out of the restaurant sure loved the show."
