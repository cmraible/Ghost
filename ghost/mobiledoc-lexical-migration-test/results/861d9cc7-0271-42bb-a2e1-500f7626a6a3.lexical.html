<p>Each week, we partner with<em> Breaking Points</em> to review some of <em>The Lever</em>’s most impactful efforts. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDEGMU6sIEk">this week’s discussion</a> with Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti, <em>Lever</em> contributor Adam Lowenstein discusses how BlackRock, the giant asset manager, has positioned itself <a href="__GHOST_URL__/for-blackrock-the-climate-crisis-is-a-win-win-win/">to come out on top</a>, no matter what happens with the mounting climate crisis.</p>

<p>We send out the clip of these discussions once a week. You can also find <em>Breaking Points</em>’ YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDRIjKy6eZOvKtOELtTdeUA">here</a>.</p>
<p>This collaboration adds to our partnerships with <em>Jacobin</em>, <em>Newsweek, The Guardian</em>, <em>The Hill</em>, <em>The American Prospect</em>, <em>The Intercept,</em> and <em>Earther.</em> All of these partnerships help defray the costs of doing our labor-intensive investigations, allow our work to have wider distribution and a bigger impact, and add to the movement to build an independent, non-corporate media.</p>
