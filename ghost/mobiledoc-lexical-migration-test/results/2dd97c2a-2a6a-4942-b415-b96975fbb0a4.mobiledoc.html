<h2 id="what-a-beauty">What a beauty!</h2>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rare-classic-french-car-discovered/">rare cars</a>, this 1968 Ford LTD Brougham 4-door hardtop is up there. You don’t exactly see row after row of these things even at the big regional car meets in any part of the country, that’s for sure. The current owner bought it sight unseen and it was in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/netherlands-barn-find/">barn find condition</a>. However, now it’s an absolute beauty.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a classic Holden restoration take an unexpected turn <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/holden-restoration-unexpected-turn/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>As the owner explain in his video showing off this ride, only about 150 were made in this configuration for 1968, which is why he purchased it without checking out the Ford in person first. There are some cars we would snap up in a heartbeat like that and drop whatever amount to fix or restore anything wrong with it. But we also no non-gearheads think that’s pure insanity.</p>
<p>What makes this 1968 Ford LTD even more of a cherry find is the claim it has only 9,900 original miles on it. Sure, people mess with old odometers all the time and you can’t rely on that, but the new owner is pretty confident that claim is valid for a few reasons.</p>

<p>That’s the benefit of a true barn find: they’re often low-mileage examples with the original factory equipment still present. While sometimes they’re stuck in a barn, garage, warehouse, etc. because they were in a crash or the engine got munched, other times the owner just didn’t want to mess the car up and so they stopped driving it.</p>
<p>For a true barn find, this car looks absolutely fantastic on camera. The paint might not be perfect and there are other details that need to be restored, as the guy points out in his walkthrough, but overall everything is well preserved. We think this guy really lucked out.</p>
