Instead, prices have been rising steadily ever since the 2020 election. Yes, they’ve spiked thanks to the Ukraine war, but Russia didn’t solely cause the problem, although it has further complicated it along with us stupidly buying oil from our enemies. Gastelu of course doesn’t explain any of this since he’s too busy shaming his fellow Americans for driving American performance cars, which is super important work!
