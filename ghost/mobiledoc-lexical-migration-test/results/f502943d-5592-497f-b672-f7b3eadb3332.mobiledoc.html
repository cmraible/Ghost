<p>They say you can’t take it with you and that’s true, which is why we’re glad James Hultman thoroughly enjoyed his toys before passing on. Seriously, the man parked his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/keanu-reeves-motorcycle-collection/">motorcycle collection</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/love-mechanics-motorcycles-friction/">inside his house</a>, prominently displaying his 1957 Ariel Four Square next to the TV. Now all those vintage British bikes and European sports cars he collected are being auctioned off by his buddy and partner in crime, Bob Thomas.</p>

<p>While the list of European sports cars in Hultman’s collection is shorter, it’s no less impressive. The vehicles on the auction block are a 1993 Ford Mustang Convertible 5.0 HO, 2001 Porsche Carrera 911 Coupe, 1971 Jaguar Type E Roadster, 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello, 1990 Ferrari 348TS, and 1990 Lotus E Spirit SE Coupe. From the photos they all look to be in at least pretty good condition, definitely worthy of being preserved, loved, and cherished by new owners.</p>
