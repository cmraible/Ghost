<p>Friends:</p>
<p>During this holiday week, many of us think about trying to make an end-of-the-year contribution to a good cause. One of our subscribers, Joe Sanberg, decided that he is donating one new climate-change-fighting tree for every <em>Daily Poster</em> subscriber — and that he will additionally match any of our subscribers who want to <a href="https://www.makechange.aspiration.com/daily-poster">donate to plant even more trees</a>.</p>
<p>Joe is a well-known progressive activist and entrepreneur (read more about him <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/la-stories/2020/10/24/millionaire-entrepreneur-joe-sanberg-on-a-mission-to-end-poverty-in-america">here</a>). Of late, he has been spearheading the <a href="https://www.plantyourchange.com/">Plant Your Change initiative</a>, which allows people to donate a portion of their credit card purchases to the global tree-planting campaign that is a part of the larger battle against climate change. Tree planting isn’t the only thing that will solve this problem, but it can be an important part of the solution.</p>
<p><strong>This week, Joe is donating thousands of trees on behalf of our thousands of subscribers -- and if you <a href="https://www.makechange.aspiration.com/daily-poster">click here to donate more yourself</a>, he will match it one for one (it’s about $1 per tree).</strong></p>

<p>You can also forward this email to encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>Many of you have emailed me asking for some positive, progressive action steps you can take in your daily life. That’s what we’re trying to do here, and we hope to do this periodically in future. We don’t receive any proceeds, revenue or donations from this — we just want to make you aware of important causes that you may want to participate in.</p>
<p>So click here to <a href="https://www.makechange.aspiration.com/daily-poster">take a look at the Plant Your Change initiative</a> and help spread the word about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a <em>Daily Poster</em> subscriber, and for working to make this world a better place. Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
