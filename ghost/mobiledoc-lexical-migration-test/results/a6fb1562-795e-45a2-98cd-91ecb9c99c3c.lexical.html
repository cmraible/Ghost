<p>Good things are happening! The U.S. Postal Service and the City of Los Angeles are exploring setting up public financial institutions as an alternative to their private predatory counterparts. Financial officials around the world are closing in on a deal to set a global minimum tax rate, in order to stop the evasive tax practices of the world’s superrich. And the movement towards literary equity continues, as New York city libraries end all late fees.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s You Love To See It, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/health/malaria-vaccine-who.html?referringSource=articleShare"><strong>A ‘Historic Event’: First Malaria Vaccine Approved by W.H.O.</strong></a></strong>(New York Times) — <em>“The world has gained a new weapon in the war on malaria, among the oldest known and deadliest of infectious diseases: the first vaccine shown to help prevent the disease. By one estimate, it will save tens of thousands of children each year.”</em></p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/usps-begins-postal-banking-pilot-program/"><strong>USPS Begins Postal Banking Pilot Program</strong></a></strong> (The American Prospect) — <br><em>“The United States Postal Service (USPS) has taken the most dramatic step in a half-century to re-establish a postal banking system in America… The move puts the USPS in direct competition with the multibillion-dollar check-cashing industry, which operates storefronts to allow unbanked or underbanked residents to cash their paychecks.” We have the American Postal Workers Union to thank for the move: The postal banking pilots came out of a 2016 <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/postal-banking-bernie-sanders-kristen-gillibrand-congress"><em>collective bargaining agreement</em></a> that the postal workers union negotiated with the USPS.</em></p>

The City Council voted Tuesday to begin a process to study the viability of forming a city-owned bank and to create a business plan for doing so.

Pramila Jayapal Turned The Progressive Caucus Into A Powerful Force</strong></a></strong>(Huffington Post) — <em>“Normally, conservative Democrats, who are typically more willing than progressives to let legislation die, are the most adept at using hardball tactics to dictate the party’s agenda. But a unique confluence of events, plus years of organizing, prepared the [Congressional Progressive Caucus] to become an influential bloc on par with any other faction in the party.”</em></p>
