On this particular truck, boost is dialed up to 28 lbs. and there’s an aftermarket tune. The guy also sprung for some really nice Fox shocks, bling bling 35-inch Fuel wheels, and some other bolt-ons. In the video you can see the upgraded hot and cold plumbing, but there’s nothing visible that’s too crazy."
