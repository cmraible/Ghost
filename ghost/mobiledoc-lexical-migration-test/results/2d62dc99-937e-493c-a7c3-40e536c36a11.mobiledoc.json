Adding rigidity to the block while still allowing access to the rotating assembly, Toyota bolted a girdle to the underside of the 2JZ. Finally, a forged crankshaft, wide bearing design, and plenty of thrust bearing, make the rotating assembly nearly indestructible. The success that so many in the tuner community have had with this engine is really not surprising at all."
