Everything from vintage BMWs to even some of the rarest American muscle cars can be found in that incredible land, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a collection as large as this one. Everything from old Ford utility vans to German automobiles built for rough terrain can be found here, but there are a few cars that caught our eye particularly well. You'll see exactly what we're talking about in just a few seconds as these cars have seen some terrifying times during their lives. The three cars that greet you at the entrance are outstanding examples of this.",

The middle vehicle in this trio of titanic proportions is a white late-model Chevrolet Nova, which has a smidge of exterior fire damage. Unfortunately, this damage continues to the interior, where you will find a mass of burnt leather and rusted-out interior metal pieces. While we can't see the engine bay, it's safe to say that this thing won't be driving around any time soon. Interestingly enough, the surrounding area also has some fire damage and the side view mirror of the white Ford Transit sitting to the car's right.",
