Under the hood you could find some pretty good options ranging from big to small V8 engines. On top of that, the suspension systems also had a lot of aftermarket support and were easy to work on. Of course, this all combined to the perfect vehicle for Ford to brand as Americaâ€™s most capable utility automobile.

A total of 302 cubic inches of displacement flows through this powerful V8 making sure the driver always has the power they need at a push of the gas pedal. It needs every ounce of torque it can get with its massive offroading wheels and tires spinning over rocks, mud, and pavement alike. Getting the power to the ground is also a fun little adventure for anyone who enjoys the experience of driving, such as myself. That's because the engine is connected to a four-speed manual transmission fit for any old school muscle car lover.",
