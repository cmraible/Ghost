While the core gameplay feels familiar, there were a few new mechanics that I really loved here, such as the new special take-down moves that restore some health and can kill a single zombie in spectacular fashion, as well as some new special melee attacks that can now be unlocked and switched in and out in the safe rooms via your work-bench, with each having their own attacks and elemental effects. These abilities offer a new way to kill zombies but not only do they play a pivotal role, each weapon has its own special abilities to which can be used after killing a certain number of enemies. For example, killing 10 zombies with your pistol can activate an ability where you can lock on to three zombies in a crowd and blow each of their heads clean off automatically, which is especially useful against the new zombie variants."

Some of these locations can hide ammo caches, documentation, comics to collect and some even have little scary surprises waiting for you (which I won’t spoil here). Of course, the main attraction here are the zombies and they don’t disappoint, coming in many different varieties from slow plodding wanderers to massive zombies brandishing buzzsaws, to name a few. Each new encounter is briefly shown by a cut-scene, preparing you for what’s in store and their potential weak points."
