That’s the kind of restomod you might talk about doing with your buddies while hanging out one night, then laugh it off the next day. Well, these guys followed through and made such a thing, which they say gives quite a few European supercars a run for their money."

The labor alone makes this Super ‘Cuda a super expensive car, but we think it was worth it. Of course, that’s easy for someone who didn’t pour blood, sweat, and tears into it to say."

Sure, a ’70 ‘Cuda looks great but it’s not as slippery as a Dodge Viper. Instead of adding aero mods and ruining the classic aesthetic of the body, the team decided to make a completely custom suspension to compensate for the shortcoming."

After, it was taken to Chrysler’s Chelsea Proving Grounds for a high-speed test. The goal was to hit 200 mph. For benchmarking purposes, a Ferrari Enzo was also brought along. Not only did the Mopar meet expectations, it blew past them."
