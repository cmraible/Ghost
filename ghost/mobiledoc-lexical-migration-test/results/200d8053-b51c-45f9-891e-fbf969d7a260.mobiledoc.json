They generally have a rear-axle design for easy high-speed handling in mind. However, this model in particular has some very special features, including four-wheel disc brakes and an iron-block engine, one of the last made with these exact specifications."

The restoration was pretty successful– it comes in the period-correct black with green leather upholstery as well as with a host of desirable accessories. It’s perfectly poised to become a darling of the concours circuit or a beast on the road. In other words, it’s ready for the next adventure."

          "Now this is a truly stunning convertible. This model is a cabriolet variant, meaning that it is one of just 954 Cabriolet variants, sporting an increase in displacement to 2.5 liters. This particular model was sold new through the Mercedes-Benz European Delivery Program in mid-1966. For the next 31 years, it belonged to its original owner in the Ashbury Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. In the 60s and 70s?! A hip place for a hip car. It was awarded the Mercedes-Benz Club of America’s Silver Star Certification for originality before it was passed on to the current owner. This car boasts a rare four-speed manual gearbox and is highly original. It’s ready to be absolutely spoiled– just look at how beautiful it is."

It’s basically one of the most universally recognized design and engineering masterpieces ever in the car world. Here’s a little more history about the SL that you might now know: SL stands for “Sports Lightweight” as the car’s engineering is derived for racing with a light and strong tubular frame, all-independent suspension, and a 3.0-liter straight-six engine. There were only 1,400  hand-finished 300 SLs built in total. This is one of them, which comes accompanied by the factory-issued "
