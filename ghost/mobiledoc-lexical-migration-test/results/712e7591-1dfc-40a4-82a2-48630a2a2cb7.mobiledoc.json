I would happily pay to download an iPhone app from my local paper that has: reliable data on what services are running on the bus routes; which trains will be affected by the bad weather; and which parts of town aren’t worth attempting to walk through.</span></div>\n\n<div>It’s an interesting idea, but I’m not sure I’d be as quick to purchase it. You see, I got pretty much all the travel information I needed during the period, just by having a few key searches saved in my Twitter application: lewisham, sutton, southeastern. By browsing the streams of tweets from these searches, I was quickly able to get a sense of the situation at both Sutton and Lewisham stations, and the practibility of getting to work by train. And I wasn’t the only one to feel that [Twitter was enough](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2010/01/07/twitter-shines-uksnow/).</div><div></div><div>Now, admittedly, during that period I had no meeting important enough that I had to be at a particular place at a particular time. And there was an amount (if small) of effort and knowledge needed to glean the information I did. Would there be enough people who needed the information Laura suggests, and who lack the time and inclination to discover it themselves? </div>\n"
