<hr>
<p>When most people think of the words "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/joe-rogans-stingray/">classic Corvette</a>," a 1956 or 1957 is the first thing that pops into their heads. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-classic-corvettes/">Corvette's first restyle</a> has become a symbol of Americana and etched itself into <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-wrecked-c8s-of-copart/">our collective consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>As you might expect, these cars are in high demand, and you can expect to pay quite a bit for the privilege of owning one. However, we found <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/206204/1956-chevrolet-corvette">this restored example</a> right here on Motorious for just under $50,000.</p>

<p>It's being sold by Classic Car Liquidators of Sherman, Texas. The description doesn't explain much about the car, but a lot can be gleaned from the 24 high-resolution photos provided.</p>
<p>Even the undercarriage is shown, easing concerns about this being a pretty car that's a mess underneath. In fact, this car looks gorgeous from any angle.</p>

<p>This gorgeous Arctic Blue Corvette looks phenomenal with silver side coves, a red interior and a white convertible top. This has to be one of our favorite classic Corvette color combos of all time.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you'll find the base variant of the 265 cubic inch small block V8. It's fed by a single four barrel carburetor. Dual quads were optional and offered a bump in horsepower. The fact that this is a single four barrel model may contribute to its low price.</p>

<p>However, this Corvette does have a manual transmission instead of the optional two speed Powerglide automatic. That may make it more appealing to buyers â€“ it certainly makes it more appealing to us.</p>
<p>We'd be happy to have this beautiful 1956 Corvette in our garage. With a price under $50,000, it's a real possibility.</p>
