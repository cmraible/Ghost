According to a local report, authorities believe the group has stolen tens of thousands in diesel from local gas stations. One news station is calling the group Diesel Gang, which is suspected of stealing from gas stations all over the Mid South."

Surveillance footage captured a Chevy Silverado and U-Haul van pull up by each other to pump diesel. While the footage doesn’t look like much, what authorities realized was the two drivers were working together to pump thousands of gallons of diesel for only a couple of dollars."

In addition, the crew drilled open the gas pumps, somehow without being noticed, and installed a fuel manipulator device, fooling the computer into thinking less fuel was being distributed and at a cheaper rate per gallon."

Police immediately found the suspect, 25-year-old Rolando Javier Rodriguez-Denis of Florida, at a gas station. Rodriguez was arrested and charged with theft over $10,000 and vandalism over $1,000. However, investigators think there are many more people in the operation to catch, so they’re digging through evidence and getting ready to make another move."

After all, how much did these guys invest in the truck modifications? What did it take to come up with this scheme? It’s like how Walter White was a genius but just loved the idea of getting one over on society or the authorities."
