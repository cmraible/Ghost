          "Flipping high-demand cars is a fairly common practice which worries automakers for a variety of reasons. While Ford decided with the GT supercar to be incredibly selective and make owners sign a strict contract with tough penalties for flipping their purchase, Chevrolet is going a different route. Instead of using a stick with the threat of legal action, the company reportedly is offering a financial incentive to keep their C8 Z06 for a while."

Will $5,000 really be enough to keep them on the straight and narrow? Apparently, Chevrolet brass thinks it is, but we really wonder."

For those who just have to own the latest and greatest but either didn’t want to get in line or are looking at a year or so to get theirs but who have plenty of money to just burn, exceeding that incentive will be a cake walk."
