<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has accused a Florida cop of using a covid relief loan to restore his classic car. Now, we’ve seen this sort of thing before with just your average Joe or even some business owners. But seeing a police officer accused of doing something so dumb and easily traceable is a new one for us.</p>

<p>According to a report, the indictment alleges Jason Scott Carter of Boca Raton of applying for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan for an allegedly legitimate business called Jason S. Carter Inc. Allegedly, the claim made by Carter was that his business achieved gross revenues of $100,000 in the year before January 31, 2020 despite the DOJ saying it only hit “minimal gross revenues” during that year.</p>
<p>If you applied for one of these loans, you know there’s all kinds of paperwork, some of which involves you promising to only use the funds to support the business attached to the process. The DOJ says Carter dropped $21,000 to fix up his old ride.</p>
<p>What we really want to know is what kind of classic car Carter has. If it’s something cool that would change our interest in this case more, especially if he has to sell it to pay court fines. But seriously, the guy is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court, although most people reach a plea agreement instead of risking sharing a cell with a nice guy named Bubba. Plus, being a former cop he wouldn’t do so well incarcerated, and that’s the sad truth.</p>
<p>Carter no longer works as an officer at the Coral Springs Police Department. He’s been charged with one count of wire fraud, which could potentially carry a sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
