<p>Movie cars range from fully custom creations to showroom stock with this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1965-chevrolet-corvette-53/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1965 Chevrolet Corvette</a> convertible obviously falling into the latter group. As is the case with most classic cars, this one being auctioned off by <a href="https://corvettemike.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike Anaheim</a> on <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Bring a Trailer</a> has an interesting back story including its use in popular television shows and promotional campaigns.</p>

<p>Despite being a 1965 Corvette, this car was actually ordered by an employee of CBS in 1962 for use on the television series <em>Route 66</em>. Sadly, that show was cancelled about a month after this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-an-old-school-and-new-corvette/">Corvette</a> was built, but it was still delivered to the production company and repurposed to <em>Perry Mason</em> where it was reportedly used on that show's final two seasons as character Paul Drake's on-screen car – not a bad ride for a fictional private detective. This Corvette was also used in Chevrolet ad campaigns featuring stars from <em>Bonanza</em>, <em>Bewitched </em>and <em>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</em></p>
<p>Even without its on-screen history, this 1965 Chevrolet Corvette is still highly collectible due to its status as a pilot line car with a VIN ending in 00012. That means this was the 12th '65 Corvette, and that year was notable as the first upgrade to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-c2-corvette/">C2 Corvette</a> including the addition of four-wheel disc brakes and functional vents in the front fenders.</p>
<p>This Corvette survives in all-original condition including the numbers-matching engine – a 300-horsepower version of the 327 cubic-inch V8. The red-on-red color combination looks great as do the spinner hubcaps. One interesting part tying this car to its Hollywood days is the faded "CBS Television City" still attached to the windshield.</p>
