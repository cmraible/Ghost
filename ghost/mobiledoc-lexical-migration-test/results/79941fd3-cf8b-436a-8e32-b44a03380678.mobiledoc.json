These parts were produced by Ford for testing, and were actually meant to be destroyed after evaluation. Instead, they survived and now find a home on this immaculate power unit. The 302ci engine is attached to a Tremec TKO 600 transmission that sends power to the rear wheels."

The 5 Window is said to be a genuine  ‘Henry Ford Steel Car’ meaning that there’s a lot of history packed into the modified machine. It's been chopped 2.5 inches at the front and 2.0 inches at the rear for that iconic hot rod look."

Sit inside the car and you'll find a leather bench seat and a cluster of aircraft-style gauges sat on a pearl effect dashboard, blurring the lines between aviation and art."
