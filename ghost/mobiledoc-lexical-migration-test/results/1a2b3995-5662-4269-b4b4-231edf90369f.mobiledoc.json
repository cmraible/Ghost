While it isn't clear which Mopar engine this 1969 Dodge Coronet was originally fitted with, today it's powered by a modern 5.7-liter fuel-injected Hemi V8. This engine has been used in a variety of applications since it was introduced in 2003, and its lower power output has this engine rated at 340 hp (since it's not known what vehicle this engine came from). Aside from the added power, this engine also benefits from having a modern air conditioning system ensuring this Coronet will be a cool cruiser with the top up or down, and this car is also equipped with power brakes, front disc brakes and power steering."
