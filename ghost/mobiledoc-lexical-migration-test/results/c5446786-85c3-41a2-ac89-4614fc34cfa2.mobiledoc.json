At least in this case the Camaro wasn’t housing a family of raccoons or mice. Judging by how it was sitting, we would have to guess someone had the plan to restore it, then life happened. That’s true with a lot of these abandoned project cars."

While we love cool machines, someone’s life is most definitely a higher priority. In some cases vehicles have sat because someone lost their job or had some other financial stress. Restoring a car, even doing the work yourself, isn’t free. Putting food on the table and keeping a roof overhead, especially is you have a family, is a higher priority."
