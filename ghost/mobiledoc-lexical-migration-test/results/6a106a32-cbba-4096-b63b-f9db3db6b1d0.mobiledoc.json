          "January didn’t start out great when Top Mountain Crosspoint motorcycle museum burned in the Austrian mountains. It housed over 230 rare, vintage motorcycles at the time and was a place many dreamed of visiting. To see the structure a flaming, hollowed-out structure with only a handful of motorcycles pushed out into the snowy parking lot was horrific."
