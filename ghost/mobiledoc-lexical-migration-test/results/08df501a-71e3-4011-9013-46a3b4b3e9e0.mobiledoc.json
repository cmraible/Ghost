For the convertible, there was an optional hardtop covered by black vinyl. Also, a redesigned hood scoop was given to those with an L88 V8 engine, the beating heart of this particular Corvette. Inside the car is a black vinyl interior with a radio and heater delete, and a handbrake positioned between the seats."

Topped with Holley 4-barrel carburetor, the car was advertised to make between 400- to 435-horsepower from the factory but actually said to make about 560-horsepower. The L88 was the closest option to a race engine offered in production form. Mechanical highlights include a hot camshaft, 12.5:1 compression, aluminum radiator, Positraction rear end, and a transistorized ignition. A heavy-duty suspension keeps handling in check and plants the tires to the ground. Power brakes bring all those horses to a halt."
