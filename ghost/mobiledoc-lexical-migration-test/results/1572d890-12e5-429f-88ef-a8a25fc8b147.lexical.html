<hr>
<p>With car shows and events being cancelled or remaining closed across the country, us car people are experiencing a little bit of cabin fever. Since a huge part of people being an enthusiast is showing off our cars and swapping stories, it's easy to feel a higher level of isolation when we don't have a way to connect with other car people. Here at Motorious, we couldn't let this continue on without some way to connect, and Collector Car Appreciation Day felt like the perfect time to schedule a <a href="https://us04web.zoom.us/meeting/register/upErc-murTkuHdOybcM93he8DUVKrwtgeCP4">virtual happy hour</a> for our staff and readers. </p>
<p>Taking place via Zoom on Friday, July 10th at 5pm est, the Motorious Virtual Happy Hour/Collector Car Appreciation Day get together is open to anyone who <a href="https://us04web.zoom.us/meeting/register/upErc-murTkuHdOybcM93he8DUVKrwtgeCP4">RSVPs through this link</a>. During the event, you'll get to learn a little more about the Motorious staff, and what makes us car people, but we are also opening it up for enthusiasts to share their own stories and talk about their cars. </p>
