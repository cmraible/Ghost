<p><a href="https://www.luckyoldcar.com/2022-spring-classic/lot-242-1960-jaguar-xk-150-fixed-head-coupe/">Jaguar is a brand</a> most defined by its dedication to pursuing style and performance over the nearly 100 years they've been around. Models such as the XKE and XJS show that off quite well, but it is rare to see a vehicle much older than that in public. However, you can find some fantastic examples made in the early 1960s which reflect the brand's focus on comfort and personal luxury. This is best shown through this <a href="https://www.luckyoldcar.com/2022-spring-classic/lot-242-1960-jaguar-xk-150-fixed-head-coupe/">1960 Jaguar XK 150</a>, which utilizes the best Jaguar engineering from its time to create a beautiful car. With each body-line wrapping around the frame like a tastefully crafted airplane, it's clear to see the appeal of this sports car. So how does this incredible vehicle back its good looks up?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.luckyoldcar.com/2022-spring-classic/lot-242-1960-jaguar-xk-150-fixed-head-coupe/">Under the hood</a>, you'll find a delightful 3.8-liter inline-six engine regarded highly as the series' most desirable power plant. This motor was made famous for its power and performance under extended use, which likely stemmed from the brand's competitive racing past. One must never forget that Jaguar takes their image of refined excellence very seriously, so this particular vehicle is held in such high status. Having been called "the most refined of the series," this vehicle fully embraces what it means to be British.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.luckyoldcar.com/2022-spring-classic/lot-242-1960-jaguar-xk-150-fixed-head-coupe/">The exterior</a> has been kept in great shape to keep with the style that made the brand so famous in the first place. A galant silver color gleams off the body in a boastful manner while the shiny vintage wheels complete the look perfectly. Even the interior, which can often be challenging to maintain for most cars, has retained much of what made it great in the beginning. This adds up to a classy British sports car with plenty of performance for any classic car enthusiast with a taste for Jaguar vehicles. Unfortunately, due to this car's rarity and high value, it seems like it may not be on the market for long. So the only question left is, who will get their hands on it first?</p>
