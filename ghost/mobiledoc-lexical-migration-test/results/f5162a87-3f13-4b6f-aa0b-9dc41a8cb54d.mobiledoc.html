<p>While the sport of Golf puts all of the attention on the players, there’s another individual out of the spotlight that is essential to the game. The humble caddy is responsible for making sure the golfer has every conceivable club at their disposal, resulting in a heavy bag being lugged around the fairway. When Kevin Na recently claimed his third PGA Tour victory, he tipped his caddy with a classic Dodge Challenger!</p>
<p>The restored 1973 car was part of the prize for winning the event. According to <a href="http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/26829231/na-gifts-classic-car-caddie-colonial-win" rel="noopener">ESPN</a>, the caddy joked during a practice round that if Na won, could he have the car, to which the top-flight golfer agreed. After driving home a four-shot victory over rival Tony Finau, Na exclaimed to his caddy ‘that’s your car!’</p>

<p>Kevin NA told <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/" rel="noopener">PGATour.com</a> "I don't know how my caddie persuaded me to give him the car, but he's a good salesman, I guess," Na continued, "He sold me into it. But I'm more than happy to give it to him. He deserves it." The star golfer was more than content with his Colonial trophy and his name being added to the wall of champions. Oh, and a winner’s cheque for $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Caddy Kenny Harms was clearly thrilled with his gift from the coveted PGA player, especially considering the current values of these cars. Last year <a href="https://www.barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/1973-DODGE-CHALLENGER-CUSTOM-COUPE-220148" rel="noopener">Barrett Jackson</a> sold a similar vehicle for just shy of $100,000. The blue 1973 model is amongst the last of the first generation Challengers with production ending in 1974. Between its introduction in 1970 to its end in 1974, over 165,000 Challengers were built with a wide variety of trims and engines available.</p>
<p>How much did you tip your last caddy? We hope Harms has many years of happy motoring with his restored Dodge.</p>
