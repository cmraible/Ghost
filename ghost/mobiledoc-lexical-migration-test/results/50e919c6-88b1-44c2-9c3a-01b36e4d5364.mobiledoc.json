It marks the end of an era when Buick dominated automotive performance in the 1980s, something which has taken on a legendary status today. It was also the end of GM’s G Platform and was followed by the shuttering of the Pontiac, Michigan assembly plant."

Line workers signed their names to the engine and undercarriage as they went through the final assembly steps. Those signatures along with signs made by workers reading “Built by the Best” and “The End” and the window sticker which reads “The Last Grand National” were included with the sale."
