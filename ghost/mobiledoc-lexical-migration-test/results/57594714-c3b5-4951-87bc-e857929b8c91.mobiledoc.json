But it wasn’t some overly-dignified event with plenty of champagne flutes, black ties, and formal dresses. Instead, the idea was to hold a 1980s-themed bash to celebrate the milestone. Even better, attendance was free to the public, so everyone can join in the fun."

Instead of following the trend of other car museums cramming cars into a warehouse, the museum in Reno adds a little more pizazz to its presentation. Art galleries, simulated street scenes with some of the cars, and other creative displays constitute a more lively and dynamic way to appreciate the vehicles which have helped shape the nation."

Not only can you look at the many vehicles, there are hands-on displays to give you feel for what cars were like back in the day. Normally admission is $12 for adults and $6 for youth, but that of course wasn’t charged on Saturday. If you ever find yourself in Reno or nearby, it’s worth taking the time to visit the museum."
