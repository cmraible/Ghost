Many argue which American muscle car is best and why, but ultimately what happens on the track remains the final word. That’s true until a 2,000-horsepower 4th-Gen Camaro called “Grubb Worm” unseated a Mustang to become the quickest H-pattern car in the world."

However, for the guys who built Grubb Worm and finely tuned it into the drag strip monstrosity it is today, this is absolutely huge."

Whatever your brand allegiance might be, you have to admit that’s a blisteringly quick run. What’s even more impressive is it was done with the driver rowing through the gears."

The team upgraded to a Chevy Bowtie Sportsman Block, a well-known option in racing for those who want high power output and long-term reliability. Still, with a turbocharged setup, they’ve struggled with header gaskets warping, among other problems which come with the territory when you push the envelope so aggressively."
