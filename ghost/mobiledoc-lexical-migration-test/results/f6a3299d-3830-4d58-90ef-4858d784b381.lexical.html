<hr>
<p>Everyone knows <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/385637/jerry-seinfeld-risks-car-investing">Jerry Seinfeld</a> is a huge <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a> guy with a major weakness for Porsches. That’s why when he recently visited <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1971-alfa-romeo-montreal-jay-lenos-garage/"><em>Jay Leno’s Garage</em></a> the event was epic. Getting the two wildly popular comedians talking about cars, and more specifically about three 1950s <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche/356A">Porsche 356 A</a> models, churns out all kinds of interesting things.</p>
<p>You might not know Seinfeld is hardcore into original classics. The man’s not a fan of restored, shiny, and beyond perfect vehicles. That’s why he brought to the Garage a 1958 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche">Porsche</a> 356 A Speedster, a 1959 Porsche 356 A Carrera, and a 1956 Porsche 356 A European, all of them unrestored originals. What’s more, that lineup pretty much covers Porsches line for the late 1950s, so to have them all together is quite the history lesson.</p>
<p>Not everyone gets or appreciates the value of an unrestored classic. Some want everything looking perfect, oftentimes exceeding the condition of the car was when it first rolled off the production line. However, many car collectors have been leaning more toward unrestored originals lately since something is lost in the restoration process. It’s definitely a matter of preference and we know which side Seinfeld favors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the episode <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-leno-drives-a-1958-fiat-600-multipla-mirafiori/">Jay Leno</a> is driving a 1927 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Duesenberg">Duesenberg</a>Model X. Back in the day it was considered one of the most desirable luxury vehicles out there. Many consider these to be the only “real” Duesenbergs. They’re a rarity today, thanks to the Great Depression making such opulent vehicles obscure in the 1930s. Also, the look cool to non-car people since they’re what you’d imagine a gangster back in the day drove. But what makes this most interesting is it’s all original, something you just don’t see with Duesenbergs these days.</p>

<p>Seinfeld and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/most-expensive-duesenberg-ever/">Leno</a> have been friends for over 30 years, so here’s to hoping we see them get together again on camera. The last time was in season three of <em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em>.</p>
