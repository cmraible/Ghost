          "A kid driving his dad’s Corvette decided he would outsmart the cops when he was recently pulled over. If you’re mature enough, right off the bat you start seeing problems with this situation, namely that most young drivers cant’ really handle the performance capabilities of a Corvette and that running from the police is a dumb thing to do. Considering this kid was dealing with Arkansas State Police, which has shown time and again how good it is at chasing down and stopping fleeing suspects, he was in for a rude awakening."

The kid uses the whole ploy that he’s stopping on the side of the road, waits until the troopers start getting out of their cars, then he slams on the accelerator like he’s the Roadrunner in Looney Tunes."

Actually, he lacked the wisdom necessary to know running from the cops was a stupid idea, and he lacked the skill necessary to stick each turn in the road. Eventually, he ends up wrecked out on the side of the road. Not only will he have to deal with getting arrested but later he’ll have to explain to dad what he did."

          "As some users on YouTube pointed out, if the kid had successfully slipped away from the police, his dad might have had an uncomfortable encounter later. After all, they likely got the license plate number when they pulled over the Corvette and know it’s registered to the father, so the natural assumption would be that he was the one driving. Hopefully that mess would’ve been sorted out quickly, but it would at least have made for some tense, disturbing moments. We’re wondering if dad realized that and thanked his son for being so thoughtful."
