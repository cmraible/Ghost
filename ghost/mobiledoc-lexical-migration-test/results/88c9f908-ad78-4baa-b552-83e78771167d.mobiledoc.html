<p>While Mitt Romney is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/us/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-judiciary-committee.html">lauded</a> for joining fellow Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in supporting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the pro-business GOP senator likely isn’t too worried about his move having a major impact on the high court. Even if the Democrats succeed in getting their nominee onto the Supreme Court, the judiciary has already been so deeply indoctrinated it will still lean heavily in favor of corporate interests.</p>
<p>As <em>The Lever </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pro-business-law-and-economics-interests-pushed-the-courts-right/">recently reported</a>, researchers have found a link between sending judges to all-expenses-paid free-market trainings and right-wing business rulings.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHnoJrkMRI">our new video</a> about how the rise to the so-called “law and economics” free-market movement has pushed the courts to the right — and then share it on social media and forward this email to friends and family.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pro-business-law-and-economics-interests-pushed-the-courts-right/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/koch-machine-pressing-supreme-court-to-crush-epa/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>We can also show how the right-wing law and economics movement has systematically produced more right-wing court rulings on cases involving labor, the environment, and antitrust.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths. </p>
