<p>In the new episode of our weekly podcast <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota sits down with freshman Rep. <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryPeltola">Mary Peltola</a> (D-Alaska), who recently made history as the first woman elected to represent Alaska in the House of Representatives, and the first Democrat to represent the state in the lower chamber in almost 50 years (12:40). </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/6915cc93/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>David speaks with Mary about how she pulled off her historic win, why she opposed forcing the railroad unions to accept the contract brokered by the Biden administration, and Alaska’s economic dependency on the oil and gas industry in the face of climate change.</p>
