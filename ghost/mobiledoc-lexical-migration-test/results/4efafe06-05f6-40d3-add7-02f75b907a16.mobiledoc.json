That's not it though, it has potential to go to 1400-horsepower, but it is setup for 91 octane fuel and longevity of the engine. 11,000 original miles (on title), less than 500 on the engine. Is an ACR (American Club Racer) which has factory race harnesses. Engine professionally built by notable performance engine builder in Atlanta with meticulous detail, machining, fitting and high grade parts."

It features power steering, power brakes, stereo, padded dash, seat belts, and tilt steering column.  Also air conditioning has been professionally added. A gentleman restored the car for his wife to drive we are told, but later sold all of his collector cars."

From his early days of drag racing his 1968 Super Stock Shelby 500K Mustang, to realizing a dream and owning his Lincoln/Mercury dealership for many years, Wayne has owned, driven, collected, built and sold nothing but Ford products. He is known to \"bleed Ford blue if cut\". Wayne feels that the time has finally come to let others enjoy his personal \"keepers\". He has owned this Fairlane for over 15 years and has overseen a complete no-expense spared restoration/build."

          "One of only 16,369 convertibles produced by Ford in the first post-WII year, this car was owned, restored, and updated by early Ford V8 guru, the late Benny Bootle, who was also President of AACA (1995). He had a custom frame fabricated to carry the V-8 engine and Corvette suspension. The car was purchased from Benny in the early ‘90s and later restored again as you see today.  A low-mileage Mustang Cobra V-8 engine and 4-Speed manual transmission were added at that time, plus the amazing Dynamic Maroon finish was laid on the original unmolested body."

Car also has rebuilt power steering and power brakes. Added to this georgous restoration is Vintage Air Conditioning and a large aluminum radiator and a digital radio in the dash. All new correct red interior in included to match the pretty red exterior."
