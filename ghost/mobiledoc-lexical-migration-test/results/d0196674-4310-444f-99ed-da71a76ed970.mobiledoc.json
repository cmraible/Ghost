          " is probably one of the most unique and rare automobiles to ever come out of the American supercar era. Starting off production in the late 1990s, these cars very quickly dominated the enthusiast space and built a name for themselves as the fastest cars produced in the nation. You probably know that the Vipers ended production in 2017 but what you might not have known is that they did a wild promotional program where you could choose literally any option or sets of features for your Viper near the end of its production, sort of like the Hellcat jailbreaks."

Issues with traction can really be a major hurdle for drivers of all skill levels to overcome when racing but this was soon resolved for round two. In that race, the Hellcat Viper took the opportunity of added traction and gapped the newer Viper by several car lengths. When all is said and done, it was time to negotiate race number three and they settled on giving the 2016 Viper the hit and placing the Viper Hellcat a car length behind. Despite the obvious advantages, the new gen Viper still lost to the Hellcat powered supercar, thoroughly pissing off the V10 Viper community and making for a great show of Hellcat power."
