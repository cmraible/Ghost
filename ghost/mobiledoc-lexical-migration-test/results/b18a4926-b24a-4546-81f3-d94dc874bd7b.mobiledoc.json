Since his release from Guantanamo, Mohammed struggled to gain entry into Canada, where the government slapped inadmissibility decisions on him based on shaky evidence they received from the U.S. government."

Invisible geopolitical forces have bent his story to their will — a story that has become so tangled and intractable that it is no longer his. How he landed in Guantánamo — so far from his birthplace in China — has been repeatedly scrutinized by media, researchers, and authorities, and is rooted, in part, in the history of Uyghur repression by the Chinese state. This repression has included the construction of a terrorist narrative to justify China’s mistreatment of the Uyghur people. Still, decision makers charged with Mohammed’s fate have yet to demarcate evidence from propaganda.”"

            "“Over the last twenty years, Ukraine has been governed by both the Russian-speaking East and the Ukrainian-speaking West. The government periodically uses “the language issue” to incite conflict and violence, an effective distraction from the real problems at hand. The most recent conflict arose in response to the inadequate policies of President Yanukovych, who has since escaped to Russia. Yanukovych was universally acknowledged as the most corrupt president the country has ever known (he’d been charged with rape and assault, among other things, all the way back to Soviet times). However, these days, Ukraine’s new government continues to include oligarchs and professional politicians with shrewd pedigrees and questionable motivations.”"

            "“When I started trying to find the pigeon lady, or ladies, or whoever it is feeding the birds downtown, I’d never seen her, but I’d heard stories from people who live outdoors in the Loop. Sam sees the pigeon lady on weekday mornings, driving down Wells and tossing seed out of her passenger window with a bucket. Mark sees her in the same spot on weekday afternoons. And according to Kelly, two different pigeon ladies feed all the birds on Lake Street between State and Wells. The more I heard, the clearer it became to me that the pigeon lady is less of a gender or individual and more of a calling. The pigeon lady is white, she’s Asian, she’s Hispanic. She’s elderly and she’s middle-aged. She drives an SUV, she drives a sedan, she has a driver — a man who is her husband, or maybe her hired chauffeur. She is a driver, according to my friend Jeff; he says the pigeon lady is a male taxi driver who rolls down his window, stretches out his hand, and feeds the birds who land on it each morning while idling in the cab line at Union Station.”"
