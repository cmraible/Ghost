<p>Motorious Digital Concours is a <a href="https://digitalconcours.com/entries">virtual car show</a>, so submit your car and go head-to-head against other enthusiasts. At the end of the judging period (once we've reached 500 submissions), a guest judge will pick a Grand Prize winner!

<p><strong>Classic - </strong>This segment is for collector cars that are at least 40 years old, and does not fall into any other hobby segment. For example, a 1963 Chevy Corvette would fall into the 'Sports' category also, but can also qualify as a classic by its age.</p>
<p><strong>American Muscle -</strong> Encompasses muscle cars from all eras, including modern muscle. This is typically a two-door American car powered by a V8. Examples include Mustang, Camaro, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/pontiac-firebird-the-history/">Firebird</a>, Charger, Challenger, Chevelle, and Nova.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Rods -</strong> A modified classic, customized for performance. These cars are typically lightweight and two-door bodies, but the term is largely open for interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Sports & Exotics - </strong>A car that left the factory with performance, handling, and driver's experience in mind. Typically a two-seater, and can be from anywhere in the world. An exotic is an extension of the sports car niche, with characteristics that make the cars exclusive, limited, or unique.</p>
<p><strong>Trucks & Off-Road -</strong> This category encompasses anything built on a pickup platform, SUVs, and 4x4 vehicles made for off-roading.</p>
<p><strong>Imports & Tuning -</strong> Even if it's made in America, an import car is anything made under a company that is based overseas. A tuner car is an extension of the import category, which includes high-performance oriented vehicles.</p>

<p>A past Grand Prize winner would be J.R. Dugas. His ride is "Clemintine", a 1958 Chevrolet 3200 pickup purchased and built for his wife because it is her dream truck. Under the hood sits a 355-cubic-inch V8 engine mated to a Turbo 400 transmission and Lokar shifter. This truck was cut to feature a '99 Cadillac bench seat, an "heirloom cherry" bed with work done by the duo, and is slathered in Lamborghini orange paint.</p>
<p>Each Hobby Segment Winner will win a Motorious Detail Pail.</p>
