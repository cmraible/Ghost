          "Looking amazing in its original Bleu Miura, the P400 was originally owned by Briggs Cunningham, an American sportsman who made plenty of notable appearances at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Being special ordered by a celebrity certainly doesn’t hurt its value, but the fact it has just 9,846 miles on the odometer and has a highly documented history with only three owners was another big boost."
