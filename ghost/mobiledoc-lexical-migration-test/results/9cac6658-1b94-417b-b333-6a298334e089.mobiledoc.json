          " We love when a stolen car story ends happily, and thankfully this one did. The 1962 Ford Thunderbird was reportedly found just days before Christmas in an apartment parking lot. It had been left there for at least three days, police told the family, and the car was covered with a tarp. However, high winds at the time undid the plan to keep it out of sight, so some watchful maintenance and security workers spotted it, then called police because they saw the news story. Other than being dirty, the T-Bird is apparently just fine.  "

The family owned the car since it was new. After the mother sold it in 1997, she regretted the decision every day. Her son recently tracked down and bought the car, only for it to be stolen."
