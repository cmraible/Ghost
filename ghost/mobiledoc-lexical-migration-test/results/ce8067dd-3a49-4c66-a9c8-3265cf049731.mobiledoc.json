He also has a Type 2 truck which has been gussied up with chrome and given a roof."

In a conversation between comedians, the Leno convinced Iglesias that putting his money into vehicles which will appreciate in value over time is a great way to enjoy an investment. Obviously Iglesias took this advice to heart."

Apparently, the comedian really wants to show off his passion after he’s left this life, so why not now? Also, if the vehicles are investments, is he never planning to divest? Probably you shouldn’t think too much about what Iglesias says but instead just laugh and move on."
