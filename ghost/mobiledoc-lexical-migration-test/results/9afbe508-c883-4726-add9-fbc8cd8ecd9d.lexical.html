<p>Welcome to TechieBytes episode 83 titled <em>Clubhouse influencers are real, here's how they think about the app (feat. Bianca Peynado)</em></p>
<p>Today I'm speaking with <a href="https://joinclubhouse.com/@biancapeynado">Bianca Peynado</a>, Clubhouse influencer and CEO at the <a href="https://instagram.com/roadblockfoundation">Roadblock Foundation</a>, which is an organization dedicated to helping fight cyberbullying. We discuss her initial impressions of Clubhouse, why she thinks Clubhouse is different from other social networks, whether Clubhouse is developing the next generation of creators, and how she plans to fight cyberbullying! Enjoy!</p>
