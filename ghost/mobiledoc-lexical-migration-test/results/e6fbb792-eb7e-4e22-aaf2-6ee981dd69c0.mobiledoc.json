Then there’s his Destroyer Grey 1969 Dodge Charger which has been built to be a super fun and comfortable daily driver. It’s also packing modern power with a fuel-injected 6.1-liter Hemi V8."

Mainly, that meant addressing the interior, which was stock and therefore pretty ugly. If you’re going to spend every day in a car, you want an interior that doesn’t just look great but also is comfortable."

There’s cool blue LED lighting everywhere, a digital cluster, big infotainment touchscreen in the center stack, push-start ignition, stainless steel cupholders in the center console for the front and rear seats, and a modern sound system. The seats are from a modern GTO and feature leather upholstery with Alcantara inserts plus big side bolsters, plus there’s air conditioning and brushed aluminum trim throughout the interior."
