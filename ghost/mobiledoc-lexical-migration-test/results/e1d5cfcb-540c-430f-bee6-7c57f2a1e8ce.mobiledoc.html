<p>Originally devised by famed Indy car builder Frank Kurtis, the Muntz Jet combined a sleek body, a powerful V8 (from Lincoln, in the case of <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-396551/1953-muntz-jet-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this car</a>), and an interior that was nothing short of opulent.</p>
<p>That interior featured a rear-mounted onboard ice chest and drinks compartment, while the front console is built around the car's radio. Apparently, these cars were <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-396551/1953-muntz-jet-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">so luxurious</a> that Muntz lost $1,000 on each one built â€“ a lot of money in the 1950s, especially considering that these cars cost just $4,500 new.</p>

<p>It was a lot of money for a car back then, and as a result, most were owned by the wealthy elite, such as stars of stage and screen. While Muntz says that he built over 400 cars, many experts think that <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-396551/1953-muntz-jet-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the true number</a> is roughly half that.</p>
<p>Each Muntz Jet has its own unique story and pedigree. We aren't sure which of the beautiful people owned <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-396551/1953-muntz-jet-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this lavender and white Jet</a>, but they clearly had taste.</p>
