<p>If you've ever been a freelancer, you will be familiar with the famine/feast cycle of the work-style. (If you've been or are a freelancer and you've only ever experienced the feast side of that equation, I hate you, but only because I'm jealous.) Happily, I'm passing through the feast side right now, and I'm pretty much well booked up until the summer. And last week, in particular, I  barely had time to look up from my desk. </p>
<p>However, that means a few things around the edges have been neglected — including my personal reading and writing. Having hit a few deadlines, I've actually had time to start going through my rather terrifying backlog of open tabs, and here are a few choice cuts that I've encountered so far that might be useful for you. They're broken down into topics for easy browsing</p>

<h2 id="seo-%E2%80%94-death-of-amp-google-news-showcase-goes-desktop">SEO — death of AMP, Google News Showcase goes desktop</h2>
<p>A few people have asked me to write about the Core Web Vitals update that Google's implementing — I will get to that soon. However, in the meantime, here's one core (ho, ho) fact that you need to know: AMP ceases to be a requirement for appearing in the news carousel.</p>
<p>The upside of this is that it might well now be better focusing developer time on making your mobile pages better, rather than building out AMP and the separate set of pages that requires. </p>

            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">Google AMP is dead! AMP pages no longer get preferential treatment in Google search</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">From the release of the page experience algorithm, there is no longer any preferential treatment for AMP in Google’s search results, Top Stories carousel and the Google News.</div>

<p>This is an interesting change. I still remain sceptical about how much traffic Google News (as opposed to the News element that gets extruded into the carousel) <em>actually</em> drives — but if you're seeing significant traffic from it, this is worth paying attention to: </p>

<p>This is <em>really</em> interesting, though: Twitter is taking away as much friction as possible in getting people to sign up for your Revue-based newsletter.

<h2 id="outside-rethinks-the-bundle">Outside rethinks the bundle</h2>
<p>Those of you who have studied with me in any way will be familiar with the tendency of digital media to <em>atomise</em> — breaking publishing bundles down to their constituent parts. However, rebundling in new forms is the next logical step, and this is a really interesting attempt in the consumer sector.</p>
<p>Building a bundle of content around a particular interest, but letting subscribers choose the elements of that content that most appeal to them, might be a successful answer to the “flight to niche” problem that has eroded the viability of more generalist titles.</p>
<p>Or, of course, it might fall foul of the general problem of being too generalist in a crowded marketplace that causes the flight to niche in the first place. Worth watching. </p>

<h2 id="substacks-comic-ambitions">Substack's comic ambitions</h2>
<p>In our self-important myopia, journalists often think everything is about, well, us. But it's not, and even Substack, the latest obsession of the media development classes, has its eyes on wider markets. They've hired Nick Spencer, the current writer of <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> and the man who turned Captain America into a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/marvel-hydra-captain-america-nick-spencer.html">fascist supporter of Hydra</a>, to help steer a new wave of comics delivered via Substack newsletter. He's bowing out from his current Marvel gig to do this. </p>
<p>Substack comics could actually be a lot of fun, and probably a lot less controversial than the wave of culture warriors that recently joined the platform. </p>
