          "Nearly all new cars sold right now come with an even data recorder (EDR) also lovingly referred to as black boxes, like what’s included on airplanes. These devices allow investigators to collect data from right before a crash, helping them to piece together what a driver might or might not have done. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has long been an advocate of these devices, attempting to force automakers to install them in all new cars. Well, it’s making another push only this time it’s not mandating their installment."

It’s estimated 99.5% of new vehicles have an EDR. NHTSA had been pushing for a mandate since 2004. Now, after conducting a multi-year study NHTSA wants to increase the amount of data recorded, expanding it from 5 to 20 seconds at a higher frequency."

While some might find this rule change to be a no-brainer, others are going to be concerned with personal privacy in general. After all, the federal government is weighing more regulations such as requiring cars to gauge if a driver might be intoxicated, disabling the starter, as well as tracking vehicle movements to calculate a per-mile-driven tax."
