The listing says that if you don't see a part on this car, that piece is not included with the sale, which means most of the interior is missing as well as some of the exterior trim. The seller also states that the original inline-six engine is \"long gone,\" but the listing doesn't say whether there is another engine under the hood. If there is an engine at all, the Corvette doesn't run or drive, but at least it is said to roll and steer easily."
