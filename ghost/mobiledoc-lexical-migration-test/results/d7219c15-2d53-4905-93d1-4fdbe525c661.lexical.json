The Roadster was no slouch as it could launch from 0 to 60 miles per hour in a lightning quick 3.7 seconds, which was the same acceleration speed of a Lamborghini Gallardo at the time. The first person to own the Roadster was none other than Elon Musk who used the car as his daily driver for years. After it had served its driving duties everyday, Musk decided to send it off in Musk fashion. No, he didn't sell the car, but launched it into space aboard the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018 with \"Starman\" sitting in the passenger seat. Of course, \"Space Oddity\" was bumping through the radio during this feat.  You can still check out the Roadster's space journey at ",
