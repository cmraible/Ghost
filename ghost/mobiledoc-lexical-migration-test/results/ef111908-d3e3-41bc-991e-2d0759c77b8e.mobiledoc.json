According to McLaren, the 2019 model has the exact same 0-62-mph time of 2.8-seconds and, just like the P1, is capable of sprinting to 124-mph in just 6.8-seconds. In case you were wondering how a less powerful engine equates to nearly identical performance, it all comes down to weight saved by the lack of an electric motor and battery."

The pair, along with a host of scoops, louvers, and diffusers all come together in the name of aerodynamics to provide the Senna with the ability to create 1,700-pounds of downforce at 155-mph. Through the use of this active Drag Reduction System, the Senna is capable of using aerodynamics to create downforce, trim drag, or air brake."
