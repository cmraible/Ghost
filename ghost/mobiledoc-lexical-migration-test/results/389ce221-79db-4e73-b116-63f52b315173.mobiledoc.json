As rare as these cars are, someone on eBay is about to get the deal of a lifetime. This 1968 Pontiac LeMans was recently found in a private collection and has all of the original manuals and some receipts dating back to 1989. It also has an open title from the previous owner. While that is just about all that the seller claims to know about the car, he has included in the listing 205 photos that are worth a lot more than words."
