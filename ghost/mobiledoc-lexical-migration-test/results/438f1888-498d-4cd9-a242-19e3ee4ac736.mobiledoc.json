Replacing the XK 140 in response to increasing competition from Mercedes-Benz and BMW, it retained much of the cosmetic styling touches used on the previous model. A few changes were instituted, most notably the single-piece curved windshield, longer hood, and different fender curvature."

Then when the S model came out with a larger 3.8-liter straight-six engine with triple carburetors and 265-horsepower on tap, enthusiasts were understandably in love with the car. The fact it had a top speed of 135 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 in seven seconds just sweetened the deal."
