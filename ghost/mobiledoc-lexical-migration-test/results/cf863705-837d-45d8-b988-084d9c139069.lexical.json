Despite having run from the cops, going 150 miles an hour on a public road, and driving recklessly to say the least, he was only charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and blocking an intersection. That’s right, the same charges for someone who stopped in the middle of the road were given to one of the two criminals who took over the intersection, put a whole bunch of people's lives in danger, and then invaded police at felony level screens. It’s unclear why sentencing seems to be fine, charges seem to be so light but at least this guy won’t be taking over any more intersections for a while.",
