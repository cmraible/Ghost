<p>A dark-money-funded super PAC helmed by a <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/2244-Short-Form-20200208-122.pdf">registered</a> lobbyist for Saudi Arabia’s dictatorship is airing attack ads targeting Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman in the closing stretch of the election.</p>
<p>The Republican Jewish Coalition Victory Fund, which is led by a consortium of corporate and foreign government lobbyists, <a href="https://www.rjchq.org/rjc_announces_massive_1_5_million_tv_ad_buy_in_pennsylvania_slamming_john_fetterman">announced</a> a $1.5 million ad buy against Fetterman on Tuesday. The group’s chairman is Norm Coleman, a former Republican senator from Minnesota who is now lobbying for the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, as well as corporate clients.</p>
<p>The RJC Victory Fund is the latest corporate front group to try to keep the progressive Fetterman out of the Senate. Earlier this year, a health insurance industry consultant <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-corporate-threat-in-dems-must-win-senate-race/">spearheaded</a> an unsuccessful super PAC effort to stop Fetterman in the Democratic primary. This time, the goal is to help Republicans take back control of the Senate and undermine President Joe Biden, who recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/world/middleeast/biden-mbs-jamal-khashoggi.html">confronted</a> Saudi Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman over the murder of <em>Washington Post</em> journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>
<p>The latest ad blitz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/fetterman-ads-black-jogger-gun.html">attacks</a> Fetterman for brandishing a gun at an unarmed Black jogger in 2013 when he was the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania. The ads follow a similar ad <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/oz-backers-launch-ads-attacking-fetterman-pulling-gun-black-jogger-201-rcna46479">campaign</a> from a pro-Oz super PAC that has been <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-oz-is-already-benefiting-from-dark-money-and-citizens-united">bankrolled</a> by his father-in-law.</p>

<p>It’s not clear who is financing the RJC Victory Fund’s new ad campaign. The group <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/683/202207149518464683/202207149518464683.pdf">reported</a> only having $136,000 cash on hand at the end of June. One of the super PAC’s top donors this year is its sister organization, the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is a dark money nonprofit that is not required to publicly reveal its donors.</p>
<p>While the Republican Jewish Coalition is ostensibly a pro-Israel conservative group, its leadership and <a href="https://www.rjchq.org/about">board of directors</a><a href="https://files.fcc.gov/opif/download/b3717dae-4004-435c-b526-220e5f93a323.pdf">is packed</a> with corporate and foreign lobbyists.</p>
<p>The organization’s chairman, Coleman, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/09/22/saudi-arabia-norm-coleman-lobbyist-republicans/">lobbies</a> for the government of Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest spenders in Washington. (In July, Oz <a href="https://twitter.com/DrOz/status/1548057063963738117">criticized</a> Biden for traveling to meet with Saudi leaders and “begging them for more oil.”)</p>
<p>Coleman additionally lobbies for the pharmaceutical firm <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/c72702ea-de58-4fa4-82df-d46f6cdc6cf3/print/">Alvogen</a>, telecom giant <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/79612766-e3b7-428b-889f-7f1cb51566af/print/">T-Mobile</a>, electric and gas utility <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/f8ec87c6-5760-4491-bf07-fe555bd48200/print/">Xcel Energy</a>, and the <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/b4652a28-c290-4b33-8cec-34a9a9db3f75/print/">Computer and Communications Industry Association</a>, a Big Tech front group that has spent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-tech-has-spent-36-million-on-ads-to-torpedo-antitrust-bill-11654767000">tens of millions</a> on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dont-break-our-prime-2/">deceptive ads</a> to torpedo landmark antitrust legislation in Congress.</p>
<p>Coleman, a <a href="https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/norm-coleman">senior counsel</a> at the lobbying firm Hogan Lovells, is also <a href="https://americanactionnetwork.org/about-aan/">chairman</a> of the American Action Network, a dark money group that helps elect GOP lawmakers to the House of Representatives.</p>
