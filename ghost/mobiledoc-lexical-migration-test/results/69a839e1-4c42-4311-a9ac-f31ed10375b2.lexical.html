However, unlike most car collectors, he had kind of an <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31392/1967-gmc-pickup?utm_medium=email&utm_source=sharpspring&sslid=MzMxMTcxsjQxNLO0AAA&sseid=MzI0tTQyMDY2NgAA&jobid=9c72c82d-d4d5-4f1c-8849-7aba023d3e31">odd affection for car</a>s, and a large majority of his collection consisted of Cadillacs and other domestic brands. </p>

<p>Even more mysterious, he didn’t always baby his cars either and he reportedly even used one of his Cadillac limos to stock the grounds of Graceland. We really can’t think of a faster way to ruin an interior than to use a car to move farm animals around in. Another time he allegedly shot another one of his cars because it wouldn’t start. </p>

<p>Despite this seemingly sporadic and odd behavior, the King was well known for his generosity, often giving cars away to friends, employees, and even complete strangers. What he wasn’t known for though is collecting trucks. In fact, it is said that he had only bought seven trucks in his lifetime despite collecting cars and running the Circle G Ranch, both of which would have possibly required the use of a truck at one point or another.</p>

Adding to the truck’s celebrity status, it was also featured on <em>Jay Leno’s Garage</em> where he and Blake Shelton drove it and even signed its dash.</p>
