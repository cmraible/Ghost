<p>A federal court is expected to deliver a ruling that would bring a major climate change lawsuit to trial. But as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1upcxuSEP0w">our new video</a> demonstrates, plaintiffs in the historic <em>Juliana v. United States</em> case face a major obstacle: President Joe Biden’s Justice Department.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was brought by 21 youths in 2015 and seeks to establish a constitutional right to a livable planet. Success would mean the ability to deem unconstitutional federal policies pushing for new fossil fuel development — a move that could greatly help efforts to address the escalating climate crisis.</p>
<p>But the Biden administration is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-is-preparing-to-crush-historic-climate-change-lawsuit/">working to crush</a> this monumental legal effort. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1upcxuSEP0w">our new video</a> to find out how — and then <strong>share it on </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LeverNews/status/1534214642125389824"><strong>social media</strong></a> and forward this email to friends and family.</p>
