<p>It's good business to remind the world of the time you went up against Ferrari at Le Mans and beat them so badly at their own game that they went home with their <em>rosso corsa</em> painted tails tucked between their trembling legs. Both times that Ford has brought back the GT, they've <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444935/2018-ford-gt-67-heritage-edition/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">leveraged that heritage</a> in the form of special paint schemes.</p>

<p>Originally devised by famed Indy car builder Frank Kurtis, the Muntz Jet combined a sleek body, a powerful V8 (from Lincoln, in the case of <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-396551/1953-muntz-jet-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this car</a>), and an interior that was nothing short of opulent.</p>
<p>That interior featured a rear-mounted onboard ice chest and drinks compartment, while the front console is built around the car's radio. Apparently, these cars were <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-396551/1953-muntz-jet-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">so luxurious</a> that Muntz lost $1,000 on each one built – a lot of money in the 1950s, especially considering that these cars cost just $4,500 new.</p>

<p>As you probably already know, the split rear window was to become a one-year-only affair, replaced by a wider single window starting in 1964. Total Corvette production for 1963 was well over 21,000, and 10,594 of them were coupes. Each one is in high demand with collectors today.</p>
<p>We found this beautiful Silver Blue example <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/217675/1963-chevrolet-corvette-spilt-window">right here on Motorious</a>. It's being offered by Classic Cars of Sarasota for a very reasonable (by split window standards) $139,000.</p>
