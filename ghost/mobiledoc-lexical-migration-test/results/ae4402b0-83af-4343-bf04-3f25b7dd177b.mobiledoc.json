However, Creature Keeper looks like it takes the top-down action-adventure genre that one step further with the ability to befriend creatures and have them fight alongside you. A very unique idea and one that&#8217;s going to make me feel like the druid I always pretended to be in many D&amp;D campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creature Keeper requires $30,000USD and is currently sitting at $14,800 after 522 backers with 23 days remaining.
