<p>Based on a 1995 Chevrolet Caprice, this Batmobile replica looks practically identical to the two movie cars built for 1989's <em>Batman </em>starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. This two-seater features a canopy opening and bat wings over the rear wheels, and while it has the iconic turbine engine intake and outlet, this car is powered by the Caprice's factory 5.7-liter V8.</p>

<p>The most impressive of this movie car trio is the 1981 DeLorean DMC-12 done up to look like the time machine from 1985's Back to the Future. This highly accurate build features all of the unique exterior styling elements from the first film as well as an interior that is the same as Dr. Emmett Brown's DeLorean time machine right down to the date display, time circuits and, of course, the flux capacitor.</p>

<p>What would a 1980s movie car collection be without an Ecto-1? This 1959 Cadillac ambulance is a done up to look like the Ecto-1 from the original Ghostbusters movie from 1984. About the only thing missing from this car is a set of proton packs!</p>
