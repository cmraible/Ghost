<p>On Thursday 12/9 at 1:30 pm ET (10:30 pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will speak with the one Democratic congressperson who voted against the $1.85 trillion Build Back Better package: Rep. Jared Golden of Maine. He says he did so because he was opposed to provision that would provide new state and local tax (SALT) deductions to the wealthy, which <em>The Daily Poster </em>has been covering for months.</p>
<p>“Democrats have to make a decision: are we the party of the working class or the party of the millionaire class?” Golden recently wrote about his vote. “We can’t be both.”</p>
<p>Sirota will discuss the cap issue with Rep. Golden, as well as explore why the lawmaker has bucked the party line on other high-profile legislation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Like all our live chats, the event is exclusively for </em>Daily Poster<em> supporting subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcast live, ask questions in real time, and watch a replay of the event. </em></strong></p>
