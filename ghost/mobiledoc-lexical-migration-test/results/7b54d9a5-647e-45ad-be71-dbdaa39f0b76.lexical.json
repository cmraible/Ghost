Instead, we’re encouraging readers to interact with us on our social media outlets, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.\n\nIt’s the familiar message: “goodbye, comments, why don’t you all pop off to social media”. This industry’s willingness to hand its reader relationships over to Facebook lock, stock and barrel concerns me.\n\n\n## Killing the community manager\n\nJason Snell, a former IDG employee, [celebrates the decision](https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/11/idg-drops-comments-from-its-sites/), but makes an interesting aside:\n\n> We used to have a dedicated community manager, but that position had been eliminated years before and editors were forced to act as moderators in their “spare time.”\n\nAnd there’s an even more familiar tale: taking away dedicated community management resource undermines any effort to have a positive community experience for the readers. As John Gallant, Chief Content Officer, IDG US Media says in the announcement post:\n\n> Second, while we’ve always valued comments, we’ve also had to deal with the reality of managing spam and policing inappropriate comments—comments that don’t reflect the professional nature of our audiences and diminish the value of community interaction. Moving the discussion to social media obviates those issues.\n\nSo does hiring community experts like Lilah Raptopoulos. But that costs *money*. If you won’t put you money and time into readers relationships – you don’t *care* about reader relationships.\n\n\n"
