On the body, it’s a splash of that white paint with dual racing stripes running across the roof line. Needless to say, Chevrolet wouldn’t have had all that much trouble marketing the car. So that’s exactly what they did, on the Indy racing series tracks."

A total of 454 cubic inches of displacement flow through the block making it a beast to compete with on any road or track. Finally, there is the four-speed manual transmission which allows for great acceleration and top speed. Overall, this vehicle might have been nearly as fast as the racers it shared the track with and you could be it’s next driver."
