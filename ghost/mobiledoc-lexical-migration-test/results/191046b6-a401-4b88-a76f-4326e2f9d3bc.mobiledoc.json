It breathes through a Holley carburetor and Edelbrock intake, while Mallory ignition components provide the spark. Twist the key and you’ll hear that rumbling powerplant spring to life while the performance exhaust helps produce a symphony that’s spectacular to hear. Thanks to the ZF 5-speed manual gearbox, you as the driver feel even more engaged and connected to this fine automobile."

Freshly polished, it really flaunts the muscular curves of the body, plus it provides excellent contrast with the chrome trim. This is a pre L model and has a look many prefer, so that’s another thing to consider. Also, the wheels are Campagnolos."
