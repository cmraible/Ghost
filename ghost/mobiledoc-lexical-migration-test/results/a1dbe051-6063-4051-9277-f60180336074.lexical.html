<p>Highly desirable, K5 Blazers make waves everywhere they go these days. That’s especially true of one like this which has been the subject of a new paint and interior, which really dresses up the truck. Classic Air AC has been installed so you’re not sweating it out in the summertime. Upgraded tires give it a more imposing stance and help with ground clearance as well as traction on trail surfaces.</p>

<p>On the mechanical side of things, a tough 350ci V8 provides that low-end torque you need to pull through mud, slush, sand, etc. There’s also an easy-to-use 350 automatic transmission. Both the engine and transmission have been rebuilt, so it would seem they’ll provide trouble-free operation for a time.</p>

<p>Right up front there’s a big thing going for the Ford Bronco since it’s being auctioned at no reserve. That means the potential of your getting an amazing deal on the off-roader is a little higher. For some the fact it’s an Eddie Bauer model is a nice plus since it comes with the extra styling details like the stylized trees and rising sun insert on the front seatback cushions.</p>

<p>What really makes this Bronco desirable is its impeccable overall condition. It’s had just one owner since new and there are a mere 34,548 miles are on the odometer.</p>
