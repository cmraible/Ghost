From the very beginning the idea was very simple. Take the luxurious and underpowered Cadillacs, throw a V on the badge and fit it with a drivetrain inspired by the top-of-the-line Corvette. This garnered a lot of new attention to the brand, especially from the younger crowd.</p>

<p>Dream Giveaway is offering enthusiasts the chance of a lifetime by raffling off this super rare <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/cadillac?promo=MOTORIOUS29">Launch Edition CT5-V</a>. This is the next in the evolution of the V badge and powerful Cadillacs. Actually, this is the most powerful Caducally ever made. It has a 668-horsepower engine that sends the CT5-V to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds. With a 200 mph top speed, this is unlike the Cadillacs your grandfather used to drive.</p>
