Importing cars into Brazil is perfectly legal, but the automobile needs to be of current model year and pay its appropriate taxes. Even back in 2008/2009, this Carrera GT and company would not have complied with the rules. Their owner attempted to disguise them with wrapping typically found on new cars, but got busted and the exotics have been in an impound ever since."
