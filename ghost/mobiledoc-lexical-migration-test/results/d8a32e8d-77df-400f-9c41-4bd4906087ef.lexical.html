<hr>
<p>You don’t need to spend much time around hardcore, old-school <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche">Porsche</a> enthusiasts to learn why they revere the air-cooled <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche/911">Porsche 911s</a> so much. That alone has been continuously driving prices upward, along with the scarcity factor and other market forces. But if you want the ultimate version of the air-cooled 911, this <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/fl20/online-only--the-palm-beach-auction/lots/r0363-1996-porsche-911-gt2/872828">1996 Porsche 911 GT2</a> being auctioned online right now is it. Estimates of what this car will hammer for are all over the place as imaginations run wild.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, the auction has just under 24 hours left and the current bid sits at $560,000. That should change considerably by Saturday when the hammer falls. Official estimates from the auction range between $950,000 to $1,100,000. Those are hefty sums, but <a href="https://www.driven.co.nz/news/holy-grail-1996-porsche-gt2-tipped-to-fetch-millions-at-auction/">some automotive publications</a> seem to feel those expectations will be subverted in a big way.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, another <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche/993">Porsche 993</a> GT2 with a similar spec sold at the same auction for a red-hot $4,000,000. At the time it was estimated to go for $2,000,000. The line of thought is that the same thing will happen with this one.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/03/2-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="1996 Porsche 911 GT2 Auction Causes Stir " loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>There’s plenty to fuel a bidding war for this car. After all, it’s just one of 194 road-going 993-generation GT2 models made. With a scant 18,712 miles this car is barely broken in. Just looking at the photos of the exterior and interior shows few if any real flaws.</p>
<p>Even by today’s standards, this Porsche 911 GT2 is pushing serious performance. An M64/60R engine works with twin KKK turbochargers to push out 430-bhp and a stout 457 lb.-ft. of torque. A six-speed manual transmission sends all that to the rear wheels, with an asymmetrical 40/60 limited-slip differential hopefully keeping everything under control.</p>
<p>Many other impressive details abound, from carbon-ceramic brakes to that massive bi-plane rear wing with air ducts you can’t miss. A two-tone black and grey leather interior makes this car surprisingly plush.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen just how much this “king of the air-cooled 911s” will go for. Unlike the one which sold a few years ago, this one will be auctioned strictly online thanks to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-to-clean-coronavirus-from-your-car/">novel coronavirus</a>. It will be interesting to see <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/covid19-industry-disruptor/">how that affects the outcome on Saturday</a>.</p>
