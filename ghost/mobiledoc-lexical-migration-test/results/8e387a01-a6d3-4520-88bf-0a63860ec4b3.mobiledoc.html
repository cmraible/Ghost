<p>Big Benz' and big engines go together like bread and butter. When AMG arrived on the scene, no one could have predicted the future relationship between the two companies – or that AMG would eventually be acquired by Mercedes.</p>
<p>This is the modern-day equivalent of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=CL65">CL65 AMG</a>. A car that just screams ‘Miami Vice’ in all its 1980s majesty; may we present the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/164696/1990-mercedes-benz-560sec-6-0-amg-widebody">560SEC AMG Widebody</a>.</p>

<p>The number of these that were produced has never been confirmed or denied, but be sure that 560SECs are a particularly rare Merc with AMG treatment, let alone a genuine Wide Body conversion like this one.</p>
<p>Allegedly just one of 50, this $143k monster would have cost the equivalent of $280,000 in today’s money. So what would that kind of dollar get you back in 1990? Fortunately, Symbolic International have included a handy price list.</p>

<p>The grand total of $39,950 got you the uprated and bored out 6-liter V8, that developed a healthy 385 horsepower along with 410 pounds-feet of torque. That’s the cost of a Dodge Challenger Scat Pack, just casually bolted onto an already eye-wateringly expensive car.</p>
<p>Breaching 60 mph takes just 5.8 seconds and the quarter mile is completed in 14.3. Whilst these numbers may seem disappointing by modern standards, simply factor in the decade and the weight of this thing, and it suddenly becomes rather impressive.</p>
<p>To take care of the rather mental power and torque, a Gleason-Thorson limited slip differential was added to the spec list, along with some rather naughty sounding AMG tubular headers and a full AMG exhaust. Add many more dollars to the out of control sticker price, then.</p>
<p>With just 66,000 miles on the odometer, and only three owners in 29 years, this SEC is ready to party like its 1990. The vendor has even gone to the trouble of undertaking a compression test that shows each cylinder is perfect, with just a two psi swing.</p>
