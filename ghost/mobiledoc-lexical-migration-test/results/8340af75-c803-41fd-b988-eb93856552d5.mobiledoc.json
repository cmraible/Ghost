That concept vehicle had a bold off-road design with elements such as side pipes, wide fenders and a unique hood with an ram air intake and heat extractors, which were all visible on the 2020 teaser sketch. The sketch showed the updated face of the Ram along with more aggressive air intakes in the front grille suggesting more of a production-intent design."

The highlight of this truck, of course, will be the performance-tuned off-road components such as a wider track, beefed up suspension, stronger axles and likely a 4x4 performance control system with a Baja mode."
