For most people, their car is the second most valuable thing they own, with their house being the most valuable, making the theft of a vehicle extremely financially crippling. For automotive enthusiasts mainly, it's easy to form an emotional bond with our cars, as was the case for one Australian man who found thousands had been stolen from him in parts and automobiles during a checkup on his storage facility.",

This massive heap of treasure was incredible enough on its own, but there was one vehicle that stood out. Likely the reason for the theft, the diamond in the rough was a beautiful 1972 Ford XA GT, reportedly the only one of its kind still featured in its factory paint. This car was valued at over $200,000, so the thieves went through with such a grand plan. One must wonder how exactly they knew about the car though it was likely information from the estate sale listing.",

The Ford Falcon is an Australian icon, and this particular one won't be hard to spot driving around because of its rare features.
