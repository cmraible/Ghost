In 1982, the fourth owner of the car had it repainted. After a long 22 years, car collector and author Colin Comer took ownership of the GTO where it was joined by the 1965 Hurst/Motor Trend Magazine Riverside 500 GTO Pace Car a year later, also purchased by Comer. The two cars were eventually sold together to another collector in Minnesota, Bob Marvin, where they resided for about 10 years before ending up with Dana Mecum."

Even more, this car made appearances in countless books and magazines, and it was even given air time during Spike TV's \"Musclecar\" television show in a road-test episode. Even a reproduction limited-edition model of the car came to life in the mid-2000s by Performance Years Enterprises."
