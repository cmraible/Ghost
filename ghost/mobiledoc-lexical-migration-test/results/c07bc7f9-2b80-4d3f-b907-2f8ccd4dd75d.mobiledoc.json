Don&#8217;t worry too much about trying to slash and jump your way up to hit him, patience is key here.</p>\n<p>You can preempt his attacks by noting which two of his four heads are about to shoot fireballs from their mouths.</p>\n<p>And be careful not to run into the flames on the ground that the fireballs leave on impact.</p>\n<p>When riding on the rocket, you&#8217;ll want to crash into him to do maximum damage. Upon falling down, you&#8217;ll want to slash at him as much as possible. You can do this even if he hits you with a fireball.</p>\n<h4>Stage 2</h4>\n<p>The big eye will sequentially drop orbs that will damage you on impact. You can&#8217;t strike at them, so use your time wisely to situate yourself in the perfect position in order to dodge them as they quickly disperse outwards.</p>\n<p>Same as before, wait for the rocket and shoot upwards. But this time he will be below you and will shoot these orbs outwards again.

And do you know what this means&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Final Boss</h2>\n<p>Phantom seems to be controlled by the mask and shows brief glimpses of sanity.</p>\n<p>First off, Phantom wants to play a little tennis with you. Hit the ball of time back and forth until it hits him. This ball will not always come straight to you, so you&#8217;ll need to move sometimes and even jump as it comes sometimes curve upwards. Once the ball hits him, approach and start hitting him. If you miss the ball (or it hits you), it&#8217;ll explode and send some bigger balls that can deal some hurtful damage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2658\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816062500-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"The Messenger Music Box\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816062500-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816062500-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816062500-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816062500-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>He will then summon lines of future that contain shock waves. Jump over and avoid them when possible, and just focus on not taking much damage. You can also strike at the floating half-skulls to avoid the ground. But try not to jump too high, because there are shock waves up the top, too. Other times he will do this where you&#8217;ll need to stay within the lines rather than out, so it&#8217;s best to focus on jumping and attacking the half skulls here.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2659\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816081600-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"The Messenger Music Box\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816081600-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816081600-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816081600-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816081600-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>After a time, Phantom will summon some duplicates, but it&#8217;s easy to distinguish the real one (he&#8217;s the one not flashing). Attack him to disperse of the copies. It&#8217;s easy for him to still do damage to you even when you strike him because of his copies, so try to hit him with a shuriken from a distance.</p>\n<p>Another attack of the Phantom will be to play on his organ to summon a giant mask. This will shoot laser beams at you, so make your way up to the wall and use the lanterns and the ring to avoid it. You can go through the lasers as long as you are airborne.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2660\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816123700-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"The Messenger Music Box\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816123700-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816123700-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816123700-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090816123700-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Other than all that, keep striking as much as you can until he is defeated.
