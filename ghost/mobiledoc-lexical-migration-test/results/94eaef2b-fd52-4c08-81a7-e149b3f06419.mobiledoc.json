          " represents Ferrari's last production vehicle featuring a naturally aspirated engine. The 4.5-liter V8 produces 562-horsepower and nearly 400 lb-ft of torque, allowing this Italian Stallion to gallop to 62 MPH in a blistering 3.4 Seconds. To offset the pace of this Stallion, the Carbon Ceramic Brakes allow a stopping distance of 80 Feet from 60-0 MPH. In keeping with Ferrari tradition the body was designed by Pininfarina and the exterior styling and features were designed for aerodynamic efficiency, producing a downforce of 309 lbs at 120 mph."
