This 1986 Camaro looks as sinister as they come in black paint with just 28,000 miles on the clock</h3>
<p>Although the muscle car era suffered a slow demise throughout the early eighties, Chevrolet's Camaro managed to keep America's automotive spirit going by escaping near death. The third generation models sported a wheezy four-cylinder motor, but by the mid-eighties things were finally looking up for the car's engine options.</p>
<p>The specimen featured here by <a href="https://www.vanguardmotorsales.com/inventory/3392/1987-chevrolet-camaro-iroc-z28?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Vanguard Motor Sales</a> is evidently the best of the best. With the re-introduction of a V8 option, this 5.7-liter was the lifeline needed to keep the celebrated mantra alive, albeit with rather paltry power when compared to the previous marque behemoths.</p>

<p>A total of 215 horsepower was pumped through a direct injection 305 cubic-inch motor spreading its wings with a 700R4 four-speed automatic, although sadly this was the only option for the V8 model. Despite the lower than expected power output, Â V8 torque is the number that really matters here, with 275 lb-ft available at your discretion.</p>

<p>A 3:31 rear end compliments this beast's cruising ability with style, alongside claims that it has never seen poor weather or winter. Looking at those photos, we would be inclined to agree. Unlike several cars with this kind of mileage, with just one owner this one appears to have driven between 200 and 300 miles per annum, so sparkly freshness is guaranteed.</p>
<p>The IROC stands for<em> International Race of Champions</em>, a North American racing competition marinated in NASCAR culture from head to toe, and naturally, the Camaro was picked as the official car for the job.</p>
<p>This package was a bolt on for the Z28, option code B4Z on the specification sheet. Along with those glorious eighties decals, owners would also find their car lowered on Bilstein dampers, Goodyear Eagle tires and aluminium wheels.</p>
