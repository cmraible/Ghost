          "We love Mopar muscle cars (and other Mopars) but they have the unfortunate reputation of being driven by quite a few criminals. It might be that they’re fast and sexy or who knows exactly what the attraction is, but it’s unfortunate. That’s why we weren’t surprised to hear about a black Dodge Charger Scat Pack running from Monroe County Sheriff’s Deputies in Georgia on February 6. It turned into a high-speed chase that ended with 4 people dead and 2 people in the hospital, so it’s a wild story."

          "According to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office, a deputy spotted the Dodge Charger going 102 mph at about 12:15 am as it traveled northbound on I-75 at mile marker 189. Before a traffic stop could be done, the driver of the Mopar hit it, speeding up to 137 mph. He was probably trying to lose the deputy, but the thing is the sheriff’s office in that county has some Hellcats and hot Camaros. We’re not sure if the deputy was driving one of those muscle cars, but he apparently still tried to pull the Scat Pack over even at 137 mph."

It sounds like the driver tried to leave the highway, but instead of sticking to the off-ramp the muscle car left the pavement entirely. Deputies from Monroe and Butts County showed up on the scene and tried removing the occupants while working to extinguish the fire."
