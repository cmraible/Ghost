It’s interesting to see how ad agencies and automakers worked to get the public excited about different models. What’s even more interesting to see is this actor in an old Ford truck commercial doing a take which he knew would never be aired on television."

We’ve shown some of these commercials before, like one pickup carrying another one in its bed while crawling over big boulders, or all the competitors’ beds stacked up in its own, or parachuting from an airplane, or even stacking up all the trucks from the same brand to show off how tough they are."

It’s pretty standard fare for truck commercials back in the day, with Ford trying to make the competition sound silly while acting all serious and tough. After that you see the take which obviously was done for pure fun. It’s crass, the actor is smoking a cigarette, and you might think it’s more like one of those funny commercials done by Saturday Night Live back when they used to actually make jokes."
