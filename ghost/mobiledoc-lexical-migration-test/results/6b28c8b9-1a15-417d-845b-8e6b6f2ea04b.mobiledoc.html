<p>Some background: In this age of corporate-owned media, we are trying to find new ways to make grassroots-funded media more accessible and affordable to the widest possible audience — and so we’re trying out this kind of partnership that offers our subscribers an exclusive discount.</p>
<p>Scroll down and you’ll see we’ve attached an excerpt of one of Discourse Blog’s recent pieces so you can get a sense of what they do. They are writers who used to write for the now-defunct website Splinter — and as I said, I’m a big fan. You can also check out their offerings at <a href="http://discourseblog.substack.com">discourseblog.substack.com</a>. Give it a read, and if you like it, subscribe.</p>
<p>Thanks as always for being a subscriber to TMI — we couldn’t do the journalism we do without your support.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>

<p>For the past few days, celebrities, politicians, writers, and pundits have been celebrating Joe Biden’s announcement of Kamala Harris as his running mate, often framing the argument around the duo’s potential to essentially fix everything that Donald Trump’s administration has broken.</p>
<p>Biden and Harris do represent that possibility for millions of people living on the margins who have been directly harmed by the Trump administration’s open persecution and defiance of both political norms and objective morals. But often, the argument for voting for Biden and Harris has devolved into something twisted and bizarre, in which Harris’s role as a public servant in a representative democracy is erased. The best example I’ve seen is this Instagram post by acclaimed director Ava DuVernay…</p>
<p>The core of DuVernay’s argument is this: the problematic or not-progressive parts of Harris’s career are immaterial, as the only priority right now is ending the depravities of the Trump administration…</p>
<p>This is, unfortunately, absolutely not how politics should work. Accountability does not <em>start</em> when someone is elected to office. Yes, Kamala Harris was not responsible for Stephen Miller’s family separation policy, but she was a senator at the time! She has held offices of extraordinary power for the majority of two decades now! If holding her accountable has to be put on pause until she’s vice president, what the hell is the point of representative democracy?</p>
