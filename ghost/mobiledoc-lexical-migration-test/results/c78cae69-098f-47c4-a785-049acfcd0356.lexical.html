<p>The mid 1960’s were arguably one of the most pivotal times in the automotive world. With an incredible lineup of great and innovative minds on hand, Ford had positioned itself to shape the course of the industry with the creation of some of the most iconic vehicles ever made. Icons for the road, icons for the track, and one for any course or terrain imaginable: <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/az21/arizona/lots/r0018-1972-ford-bronco-custom/1011480?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=AZ21#/expandGallery">the Ford Bronco</a>.</p>

However, by the end of the first generation, the Bronco, with its V8 powered 4x4 rugged ‘do it all’ attitude had solidified it as the most iconic all-terrain utility vehicle ever.</p>
