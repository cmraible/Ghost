While some in the Bay Area might buy a few to get applause from the public, more will likely have the same reaction as Idaho State Police, which is looking to move from the Dodge brand to something else."

That could give Toyota the chance to make a pursuit-rated Camry, a dream we’ve always had (that’s a joke). Other possibilities include the Nissan Altima, Mazda3, Hyundai Sonata, that one ugly Kia, or a Volkswagen Passat (that’s a joke too – the Passat itself, that is)."
