However, making some of the most luxurious American cars typically has also meant making large, inefficient vehicles and in the wake of the Arab Oil Embargo, the US Government made it clear that it was time for that to change. </p>

<p>In response to government regulations in 1977, the new <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/649/1977-cadillac-coupe-deville">Cadillac Coupe DeVille </a>was redesigned to be lighter and more efficient. For any other manufacturer, this could’ve resulted in turning a luxurious roomy car with plenty of power into a cramped uncomfortable slouch that nobody wanted, but not for Cadillac. Instead, the higher roofline and shortened and narrowed redesign made for a Deville that was more spacious and more comfortable and despite losing the massive 500-cid engine from the previous years, the Deville was more efficient and power nearly remained the same.</p>
