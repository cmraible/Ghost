The classic American sports car was in the spotlight before the auction even began, thanks to its impressive presentation, rarity, and the fact it’s considered a thing of myth among the Corvette faithful."

          "Few opted for the RPO ZL-1 option in 1969 since it made a Corvette over twice as expensive, a steep price even for dedicated enthusiasts. However, the tradeoff was a hard-hitting V8 derived from the CanAm racing engine, only the L88 was street legal but with a potent 560-horsepower. According to GM records, just two of these cars were assembled at the St. Louis plant and delivered to customers, but this is the only convertible."

The reputation of the driver and sports car grew, however Maher eventually stored the car away, not to be returned to public view until 1989."

Then, in 2007 Maher sold the monstrous classic sports car to the party which this year entered it into the RM Sotheby’s auction in Arizona. This was why so many were chomping at the bit to own this one-of-a-kind convertible 1969 Chevrolet Corvette ZL-1, driving the price to a lofty position. Some might never live to see it cross the auction block again."
