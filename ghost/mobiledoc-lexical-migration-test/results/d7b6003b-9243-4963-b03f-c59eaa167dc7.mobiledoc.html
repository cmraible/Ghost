<hr>
<p>Every month, iSeeCars does an analysis of the top 20 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/buying-salvage-c8-corvette/">fastest-selling new and used cars</a> in America. It’s always an interesting examination of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/surging-prices-used-cars/">how the market is moving</a>, especially in these times of constrained supply and inflated prices. However, just as interesting is the fact the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-unloads-on-c8-corvette/">C8 Corvette</a>, which has dominated the top spot for the new cars list, was finally knocked off for May.</p>
<blockquote><em>Learn what's driving high used car prices and when they might go back to normal <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/surging-prices-used-cars/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>While the Chevy Corvette still occupied the second spot, it relinquished its reign to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1998-mercedes-benz-g320/">Mercedes-Benz G-Class</a>, or what many lovingly refer to as the G-Wagen. Completely redesigned, the luxury off-road SUV is selling in an average of 9.4 days with an average transaction price of $174,887. In other words, people with big incomes definitely <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/luxury-car-sales-are-booming/">don’t seem to be feeling the economic pinch</a>, something we’ve known and highlighted before.</p>

<p>When it comes to used cars, the Mazda Miata reigns supreme with 19.5 average days to sell and an average price of $25,009. Hot on its heels is the Tesla Model 3 at 20.2 days and $44,779 with the Chevy Corvette rounding out the top 3 at 21.8 days and $74,773.</p>
<p>The study also looks at the fastest-selling new and used cars by city, so we can see where people know how to have a good time. Albuquerque is moving used Chevy Camaros the quickest at just 21.2 days on average. Shoppers in Tampa-St. Petersburg are also flocking to used Camaros, which are moving on average in 11.6 days there.</p>
