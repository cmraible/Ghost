With heavy damage visible on the muscle car, the first responders were concerned someone might be trapped inside or submerged in the water. However, a search turned up absolutely nobody."

After all, a thief would crash a vehicle after going for a joyride and ditch it without a second thought. They wouldn’t want to get caught by the police, plus they don’t care about the Camaro at all. Only that wasn’t what happened this time."

The photos on the scene show the sunroof glass peeled back and laying on the windshield, but that could have been done by firefighters. If not, someone probably had one hell of an adrenaline rush after the crash."

Police didn’t say whether impairment was a factor, but we wouldn’t be surprised to find out it was. If you ever do wreck out, the worst thing you can do is take off and leave your car in a heap. Police will be more understanding if you stick around, even if you did something dumb leading up to the crash."
