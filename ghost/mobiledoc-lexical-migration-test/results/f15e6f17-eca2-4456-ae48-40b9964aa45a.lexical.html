<hr>
<p>Forget Broncos, Wranglers and Gladiators. If you want a rugged off-road vehicle with plenty of style and luxury, this bespoke <a href="https://ecdautodesign.com/portfolio-item/project-mas/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Land Rover Defender 130 restomod</a> from <a href="https://ecdautodesign.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">ECD</a> is unrivaled. With classic looks and the heart of a C6 Corvette, this Defender – nicknamed <a href="https://ecdautodesign.com/portfolio-item/project-mas/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Project MAS</a> – is a beast of an off-roader, and just for good measure, it delivers all the refinement of a modern Range Rover.</p>

<p>Even before you have a chance to peek inside or listen to that all-American V8 fire up, this Defender has an imposing presence. The iconic body with its beautifully flat front fenders is painted in black with an eggshell finish, and the stance is perfect with 20-inch wheels with a matte finish and wrapped in meaty BFGoodrich T/A K02 tires. The ruggedly good looks include a roof rack, front and rear LED light bars and diamond plating in the cargo bed, while the jerry cans and side-mounted traction skids show that this Defender is ready for action.</p>
<p>While this Defender will undoubtedly be incredibly fun off road, ECD designed this truck to ensure that the driver and passengers will enjoy the journey as much as the destination. Up front, this Defender delivers maximum luxury with heated and cooled Corbeau seats with a beautiful quilted pattern stitched in, and the driver gets a view of the white-faced gauged (with pink needles and lettering) through a Momo steering wheel. An Apline stereo system with Apple CarPlay and a wireless smartphone charger bring modern cabin tech into this high-lux interior.</p>
<p>Under the hood, is a 6.2-liter LS3 V8 pulled from a C6 Corvette, but like the rest of this truck, this is not your ordinary LS engine. With an output of 565 horsepower, this Defender delivers significantly more power than the version that came straight from the factory, and this engine is sure to sound good with a sport dual exhaust system that is finished with black pipes.</p>
