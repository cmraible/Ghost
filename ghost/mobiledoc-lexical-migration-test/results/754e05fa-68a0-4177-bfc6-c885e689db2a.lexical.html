<p>While most of us have been cooped up in our house during the COVID-19 pandemic, thieves have been taking advantage of the situation with an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">increased number of car thefts</a>. Just last month, a gorgeous <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/epic-stash-muscle-car/">muscle car</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/stolen-1969-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-crashed-recovered/">1969 Chevelle SS was stolen</a> from a driveway before the driver led police on a chase and later crashed the car in Northern Washington, and now this week, a late model Camaro was also stolen in Washington with similar results including a police chase and a car crash.</p>

<p>According to a Tweet from the public information officer from Washington State Patrol's District 1, the stolen Camaro's driver took police on a chase reaching 110 mph before crashing into another vehicle and then a telephone pole. The unidentified 30-year-old driver got out of the car and was attempting to fight one of the police officers, but he bit by a police dog and arrested.</p>
<p>As you can see in the picture above, the Camaro suffered extensive damage in the crash, and with two occupants trapped in the car, the first department were required to cut the top off for extrication. A report from <em>KOMO News</em> indicates that the Camaro was stolen from Joint Base Lewis-McChord on March 24, and aside from the driver suffering a dog bite, it doesn't appear that there were any major injuries to the driver of the other car, the police officers or the police dog.</p>
