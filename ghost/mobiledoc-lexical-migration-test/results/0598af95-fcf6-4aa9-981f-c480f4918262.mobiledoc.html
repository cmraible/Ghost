<p>In an effort to <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/winaZ51corvetteconvertible?promo=MOTAUG">keep the history</a> of motorsports alive, the International Motor Racing Research Center is committed to archiving, collecting, and sharing the history of motor racing. The Perry Bishop, Mark Scarano, and Associated press collections are among the centers largest collection of photos and other documentation. If you are a racing fan and haven’t, at very least, visited the centers website, you are missing out. Their archives are open to everyone, journalists and enthusiasts alike. Even the center's facility located in the heart of New York's Finger Lakes Region is open to the public free of charge. Unfortunately, nothing is free though and the center <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/winaZ51corvetteconvertible?promo=MOTAUG">operates off of donations</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em><em>For as little as a $25 donation, you could <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/winaZ51corvetteconvertible?promo=MOTAUG">win this Corvette</a>!</em></em></blockquote>
