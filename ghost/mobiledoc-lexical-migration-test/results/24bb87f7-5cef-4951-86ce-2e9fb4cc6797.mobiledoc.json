It’s based off the famous project Hell National we covered before, which mixes the potent Mopar engine with the potent 80s GM car. That alone angers the purists, but whatever, we’re all for interesting builds."

You don’t want to wipe away the unique look of the vehicle just because you swapped in a big, bad supercharged Hemi V8. While the GNX kind of blended in with so many appliance American cars of the 80s, the black body panels and black trim set it apart. That blacked-out look should absolutely be how this car is in real life once complete."

That rear spoiler in the rendering is in three pieces, while at the moment the real spoiler is one piece of material (we believe it’s metal, but not sure on that one). Maybe the owner will like what the artist did there and change the design? We’ll see when the Hell National is finally complete."
