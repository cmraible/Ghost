<p>Producing 185-horsepower, a 431cui 135-degree V16 engine was stuffed under the hood and shifted by a 3-speed manual transmission. For 1938, Cadillac decided to go with an all-new V16 engine, and they dropped the overhead valves and replaced them with a flat-head configuration that was more powerful and weighed less than prior models. One of the reasons for this was to shorten the length of the wheelbase by 13 inches. A few years later due to economical reasons, the V16 was completely dropped with only 515 built over the course of its production run. For the 1938 model year, only 315 units were built total, and only 10 of those were V16 convertibles like this one. That's right, this vintage Caddy is just one of 10 ever made.</p>
