Maybe it was to skip traffic, get away from the cops, or just to go exploring somewhere they couldn’t because they don’t own a boat. Well, this Corvette is designed to give you that kind of experience, only it’s not an amphibious car. Instead, it’s like a small boat that’s made to look like a Corvette or maybe a Ferrari, depending on your automotive persuasion."

However, those “wheels” you see are really just part of the hull shaped to look like what you’d see on a car. This isn’t an amphibious vehicle, but those have existed for a long time."

From the video, this Corvette thing seems to maneuver similar to a jet ski, although it is wider and longer. But it appears to turn a tight circle, so it looks like an absolute blast to drive."

Just like a C8 or a Ferrari, the engine is located behind the seats. It’s a 1800cc, so not exactly what you’d find in a Ferrari or Corvette, but it’s enough to get this thing moving in a hurry."
