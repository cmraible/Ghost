<p>Ready to grab everyone's attention, the exterior is finished in a stunning Porsche Dark Blue and topped with Silver stripes, and it sits on a set of 18-inch knock-off wheels wrapped with Nitto rubber. The cockpit of the car is also exceptional with classic style gauges, black leather bucket seats, and a wooden steering wheel. </p>
<p>When it comes to performance, this <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Backdraft Cobra</a> is stuffed full of modern goodies. Tucked under the hood is a Roush 427SRX V8 engine mated to a Tremec TKO 5-speed manual transmission. Iconic side pipes are made of aircraft-quality 304 stainless steel that will make your presence known a mile away, and an MSD ignition instantly fires this lightweight roadster to life. This lightweight roadster generates 480-horsepower and 500 lb/ft of torque, and it can sprint from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.5-seconds. </p>
