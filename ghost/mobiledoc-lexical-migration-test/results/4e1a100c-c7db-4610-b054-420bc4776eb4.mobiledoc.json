Owning the premiere EV brand is a status symbol in certain circles, which has helped aid the rapid spread and helped destabilize the luxury end of the market. While owners might feel good about zero tailpipe emissions, thieves are feeling great about how easily they can steal the quite valuable wheels and tires off Teslas."

Still, police have counseled owners to turn on Sentry Mode and plug in a flash drive so events are recorded. Parking your vehicle in a secure facility at night is best, but if you can’t then select a well-lit location near plenty of traffic. If you park on a fairly steep slope, it makes jacking up the car more difficult, meaning thieves might pass your ride over for an easier target."
