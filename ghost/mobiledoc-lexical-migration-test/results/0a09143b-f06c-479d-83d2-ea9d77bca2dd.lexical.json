The reason for this infamously terrifying title is the incredible track performance, body style, and suspension design that carried the car through thousands of victories across history. While this supercar may not be very old, it still has the weight of every racer brave enough to get behind the wheel and steal the victory. So it makes sense that this would be one of the most desirable modern Lamborghini on the sports car market today.

If you happen to be an American with a passion for drag strip runs, this supercar can complete a quarter-mile run in a mere 12.3-seconds.
