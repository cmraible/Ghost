If you don’t know, snowstorms in state can be quite fierce, something anyone who lives there should know well. That’s why it’s shocking to see the mid-engine American sports car just left on a snowbank on the side of the snow-encrusted road."

For starters, ground clearance is a big factor as the white stuff accumulates on roadways. If your car is low enough it starts to become the wrong kind of snowplow, which can lead to a loss of control or just leave you stranded."

Supposedly this happened during a storm, and when you have snow coming down from the sky, combined with it getting kicked up and trailing off vehicles in front of you/going the opposite direction, the result is visibility is cut. Add to that a sports car that’s low to the ground and you’re just getting pelted so even keeping the wipers going full-tilt doesn’t allow you to really see."
