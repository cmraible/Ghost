<p>With all the headlines about supply chain woes and photos of empty grocery store shelves and container ships waiting in line at ship ports, one could get the impression that the economy is in shambles. At least, that’s what Republicans yelling about inflation want you to think. As we note in this edition of Weekend Reader, a number of reporters and economists dug into the issue to see what is really going on with the economy, and concluded that despite inflation, real wages are going up and government stimulus is working.</p>

<p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/bidenomics-inflation-approval-rating.html"><strong>Bidenomics Is Working</strong></a> (New York Magazine) — <em>Polls suggest that voters are not pleased with the state of the economy, and media coverage is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/business/economy/biden-inflation.html"><em>implying</em></a> that inflation is out of control.</em> But writer <em>Eric Levitz makes the case that, on the economy, Biden is delivering. “America is enjoying an exceptionally swift economic recovery, rising household wealth, falling income inequality, a resurgence in labor’s economic power, and soaring capital investment,” he writes. “In these respects, Bidenomics has proved to be a smashing success.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/1-trillion-in-checks-and-5-inflation"><strong>$1 trillion in checks and 5% inflation. Worth it!</strong></a><em></em>(Stay-At-Home Macro) — <em>Stimulus checks didn’t change the structure of the economy, but they did play a key role in keeping the recession as short as possible and minimizing its damage, writes economist Claudia Sahm.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://jwmason.org/slackwire/a-c-shaped-recovery/"><strong>A C-Shaped Recovery?</strong></a><strong></strong>(J.W. Mason) — <em>Economist J.W. Mason adds to Levitz’s rosy view of the economy in a blog post, pointing out that without the American Rescue Plan and other investments, the economy could be in a much worse place. “It’s somehow becoming conventional wisdom that the economy is ‘overstimulated,’ as if the economic disruptions of the pandemic could have been managed some other way,” Mason writes. “As Claudia Sahm observed last week, the choice facing policymakers was either to repeat the mistakes of the Great Recession or to go big. Fortunately, they went big.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tker.co/p/suppliers-delivery-times-inflation-risk"><strong>The Indisputably Good Force Behind The Supply Chain Nightmare</strong></a> (TKer) — <em>What about all those photos of boats lined up at ports and headlines on supply chain woes? It’s less an issue of labor shortages, writes reporter Sam Ro, and more due to booming demand.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/another-buffalo-is-possible"><strong>Another Buffalo Is Possible</strong></a> (The New Yorker) — <em>“Lately, we’ve grown accustomed to seeing conflict within the Democratic Party in Washington, between those who embrace an aggressive brand of progressive politics and the centrist establishment. But the phenomenon is hardly limited to Congress. Across the old Rust Belt, from St. Louis to Pittsburgh and Buffalo to Detroit, you will find showy development and claims of downtown renaissances — alongside stifling poverty, a degraded public sector, and rampant police misconduct. Democrats have largely overseen these disasters, but for those who wish to challenge them the Democratic Party tends to be the only viable vehicle from which to do it.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/29/big-pharma-donations-medicare-drug-pricing-democrats/"><strong>Democrats Find Their Big Pharma Bag Is Making It Inconvenient To Take On Big Pharma</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>“In 2018, as Medicare for All surge [sic] in popularity, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spying a shot to finally regain the House, warned candidates not to run on single-payer or any big sweeping reform, urging them instead to focus on lowering drug pricing, citing internal data that it polled better,” </em>The Intercept<em> reports. Now, with a Democratic trifecta, a measure to allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices has been omitted from the party’s signature legislation. Once again, when donor interests come up against voter interests, money wins.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/is-this-a-strike-wave"><strong>Is This A Strike Wave?</strong></a><strong></strong>(Dissent)<strong> — </strong><em>The great labor historian Nelson Lichteinstein points out that, compared to past moments of labor militancy in the United States, there aren’t actually very many strikes happening. What may be different “is the cheerleading, the hope, and the expectation for a labor upsurge,” Liechtenstein writes. Why no strike wave, then? “Non-union workers, no matter how aggrieved, do not go on strike.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3abzb8/billionaires-sorts-hoffman-mcgowan-acronym-coure"><strong>She Created an Ultra-Partisan News Agency; Now Billionaires Are Giving Her Funding to Fight Disinformation</strong></a> (VICE) — <em>“The founder of Acronym, a startup best-known for funding a company that went on to disastrously screw up the 2020 Iowa caucuses, is remaking herself as a fighter against disinformation, according to an Axios report from earlier this week. Tara McGowan does, to be fair, have some experience in the politically-motivated, ultra-partisan news space — but it’s on the wrong side. Acronym founded a news outlet, Courier Newsroom, which solely produced news favorable to Democratic candidates and elected officials, an unusual blend of newsroom and political action committee that might, in less polite company, be termed propaganda… All of this makes it a bit surprising that billionaire philanthropists Reid Hoffman and George Soros are funding what Axios describes as ‘a multi-million seed investment’ into a new venture called Good Information, Inc., which, per Axios, will be led by McGowan.”</em></p>
