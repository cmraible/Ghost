<p>Friends:</p>
<p>The most pervasive censorship today is corporate media erasing news that offends its corporate sponsors.</p>
<p>We’re not funded by huge corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — so we’re using our resources to fight back with a new video series spotlighting the reporting that corporate media doesn’t want you to see.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://vimeo.com/674657206">click here</a> to watch our first video, which is already going viral — and know that your support is what makes this new video initiative possible.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/674657206?h=4e2a511597&app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Daily Poster - California Single Payer 02-2022"></iframe></figure>
<p>This video is based on <em>The Daily Poster’s </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/newsoms-big-choice-single-payer-or-his-insurance-donors/">reporting</a> that exposed California Gov. Gavin Newsom betraying his health care campaign promise after a health insurance corporation wrote a $1 million check to his state party.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of journalism we do - but we can only do it because of you, our paid subscribers. We’re aiming to do a lot more of these videos — and if you want to help us with that beyond your subscription, please use our tip jar to throw in what you can.</p>

<p>Thanks for all of your support — as you can see, we are working as hard as we can to hold politicians accountable.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
