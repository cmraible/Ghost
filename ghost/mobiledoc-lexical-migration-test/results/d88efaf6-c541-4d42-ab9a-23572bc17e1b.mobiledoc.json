Now, some would say it’s best to just haul it off to the junkyard and be done with it. Instead, WD Detailing was called in to clean up the beauty, showing why so many fell in love with the radical design during the last oil crisis."

You get to see that curvaceous body get pressure washed, a lot of the dirt almost falling off. That’s followed up by a hand washing, clay bar, then a nice polishing to bring that shine all the way back."

          "Developed by two young unknowns in the auto industry, the Sterling Nova turned plenty of heads with its dramatic and surprisingly well-balanced design. Nobody really expected much from kit cars back in the early 70s, so to see one which arguably rivaled some production cars was jarring in a good way. The fact it uses a lifting canopy was just the icing on the cake and makes the Sterling Nova memorable even today."

Each one was made using a donor Volkswagen Beetle, meaning acceleration was tepid. Understandably, some people still blow these kit cars off as wannabe rides. However, they still have a cult following today and it’s easy to see the appeal, at least when it comes to the aesthetics."
