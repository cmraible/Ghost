It was to be shipped to Florida where a certain car collector would add the piece to his fine collection of automobiles. However, being that it was being shipped from Quebec, it had to go through customs. Luckily the border patrol inspectors noticed that the VIN plate had been tampered with so they seized it and the US Attorney's Office For The Western District Of New York has filed a civil action to determine the carâ€™s true owner.",
