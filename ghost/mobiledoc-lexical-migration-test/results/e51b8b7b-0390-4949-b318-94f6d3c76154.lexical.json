Besides its ridiculously unique looks, the Daytona featured many mechanical upgrades over the regular Charger models. Heavy-duty suspension and braking systems underpinned the model and Dodge offered the choice between two engine options. Buyers could have the 440-cid Magnum engine as a standard option or opt for the 426-cid HEMI. In all Dodge made 503 examples, making these cars incredibly rare and highly collectable today.",
