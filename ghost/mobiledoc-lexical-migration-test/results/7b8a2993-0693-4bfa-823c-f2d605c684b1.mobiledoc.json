Silver wheels from the factory, red OE brake calipers, and all the original badging are all present. You get to enjoy the vented hood and awesome side-exist exhaust, too. Soft leather seats with big bolsters, silver pedals and trim pieces, plus white-faced gauges keep the interior interesting."

Thanks to designer Osamu Shikado, the Dodge Viper received a slimmer and more modern restyling for 2003. It also got a big performance boost to stay ahead of the competition. While the Viper was officially discontinued after 2017, the car has a legendary aura that lends heavily to its collectible nature today."
