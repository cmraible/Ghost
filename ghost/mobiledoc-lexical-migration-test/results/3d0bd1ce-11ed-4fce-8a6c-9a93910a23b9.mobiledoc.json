It's difficult, that's for sure, but it never felt like the game had cheated me; each time I died, I took a deep breath, went back to the drawing board and focussed on my enemies' patterns. The crow's abilities aren't overly complex but rather, it relies on its smooth gameplay. You have your melee weapon, with four additional weapons to collect (well, three if you don't count the umbrella), each with their own unique attributes and four spells (which should be more aptly referred to as skills). You'll begin with the bow but you'll then unlock other spells that can be used strategically in combat as well as allowing you to reach new areas in dungeons and the overworld."

Checkpoints are marked by activating Death Doors which bring you back to the Hub World, allowing you to easily go back to upgrade your skills or travel to a previously traversed area. Despite knowing this and activating each door that I came across, I sometimes found that upon dying, I would need to traverse a long way to get back to where I was (which can also be frustrating when losing to a boss/mini boss). This is also where the lack of map is a detriment (despite my overall praise for it)."
