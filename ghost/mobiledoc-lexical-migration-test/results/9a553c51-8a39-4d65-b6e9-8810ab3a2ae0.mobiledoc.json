The brief, which explores how variations in the speed and cost of nonpayment-related evictions in the U.S. impact tenants, highlights how easily people can lose their homes. According to LSC, “In 11 states, tenants can be evicted from their homes in as little as two weeks after missing a rent payment. For low-income renters, this can mean going from housed to homeless in a matter of days.” Once they receive an eviction summons, many tenants face additional challenges, such as finding legal help, taking time off work, and securing childcare to attend their hearings."
