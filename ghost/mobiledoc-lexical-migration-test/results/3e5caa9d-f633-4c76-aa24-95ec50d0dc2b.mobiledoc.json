That’s right, the roadway where in many areas there’s no speed limit doesn’t seem like the kind of place one would just let a computer do the driving, but we suppose when you live around it the thrill might wear off. Or maybe it was the drugs."

The whole incident started when an officer noticed the man’s seat was reclined back, his eyes were closed, and his hands weren’t on the steering wheel, leading police to believe Autopilot was engaged."

If he was in fact on something at the time, plus he was asleep, he probably had no idea there was a problem at all. As for the Tesla, it was driving at about 68 mph and maintained a safe following distance."

When they finally woke up the driver, he pulled the Tesla over, but the whole ordeal took about 15 minutes. Police claim they found a steering wheel weight in the footwell of the car, a device which is designed to trick Autopilot into believing the driver’s hands are on the steering wheel. Autopilot periodically checks for steering wheel pressure to prohibit people from napping or just not paying attention since it’s not a truly fully-autonomous driving technology."
