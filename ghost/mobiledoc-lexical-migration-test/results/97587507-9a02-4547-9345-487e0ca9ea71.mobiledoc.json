Renderings like this could turn into reality as misguided youths who spend too much time on Instagram find themselves in possession of a modern muscle car. We need to do something about this before tragedy strikes."

Plus, there’s a front splitter which looks like it won’t allow this car to roll over any speed bumps, driveway skirts, etc. (hopefully in real life this ride would have an adjustable air suspension or a more realistic splitter with the shipping guard still attached). Why these elements are so popular on Instagram is anyone’s guess, but it’s been beat to death."

For some reason he threw classic JDM-style side mirrors on the car. And he alludes to it being a Hellcat when it’s wearing a Demon hood, asking if he should call this rendering the “Hell-camino.” How about hell no? Also, he does realize the El Camino was a Chevy, right?"

However, the way they modify them they no longer look like American muscle and instead are something daintier and ugly. The fact this rendering has a European background makes sense: this guy is based in London and he’s trying to Europeanize the Mopar. Let’s keep American performance cars American in their styling, please."
