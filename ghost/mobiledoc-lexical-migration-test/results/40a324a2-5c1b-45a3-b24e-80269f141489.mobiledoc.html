<p>We are happy to see that this significant <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ferrari-banned-celebrities/">Ferrari</a> is getting a new chance at life. Considering the amount of work that will go into rebuilding and restoring the car, it may come out even better than before, if that is possible. Let's just hope that after the restoration is complete that the car will be driven and used and not spend its life sitting in a garage.</p>
