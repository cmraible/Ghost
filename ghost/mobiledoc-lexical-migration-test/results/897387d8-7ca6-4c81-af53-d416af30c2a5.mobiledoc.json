We see the effects all around us, and it unfortunately has bled into the automotive world. A prime case is this 1991 Camaro which wears a 2011 COPO Camaro body kit. Just looking at this thing should fill you with confusion."

You can see from the photos the interior is clean and the body looks pretty good, save some blemishes on the nose. According to the dealership selling it, the tires are at about 75 percent. They also say the muscle car runs without problems, so it should be a turnkey purchase if you decide to take the plunge."
