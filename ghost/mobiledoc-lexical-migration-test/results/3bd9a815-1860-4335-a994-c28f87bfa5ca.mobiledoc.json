Not that Microsoft&#8217;s product isn&#8217;t a bad service &#8212; it just isn&#8217;t free. If you were one of the many hoping that another option would pop up, rejoice! &#8212; Pandora has made its way to the Xbox One as a native app.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_0248.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0248.JPG\" width=\"322\" height=\"185\" />I&#8217;ve been playing with Pandora a bit this afternoon, and I can say with certainty that it&#8217;s going to make a lot of One owners very happy. For a lot of the people who own it, the Xbox One is the center of their entertainment world, so giving it the ability to act as a big-screen DJ is only natural.</p>\n<p>Are there some flaws with the app? Absolutely. In the short time I&#8217;ve been testing it, I&#8217;ve come across a few holes, such as a lack of background play, and the inability to navigate the app while it&#8217;s snapped. When playing a game or using some other app, you have to full-screen Pandora to start or change a station, and I&#8217;m finding that to be really disruptive. The missing background play may be more a limitation of the One&#8217;s software, so I&#8217;m willing to look past that, but not making the app Snap-friendly outside of simply listening to music is simply inexcusable for an app that launched a year after the system.</p>\n<p>But hey, it&#8217;s Pandora. It&#8217;s here, and it plays music really big on your TV. And if you&#8217;re willing to forget that Pandora&#8217;s Snap mode is super disappointing, you may find it fills a massive void in the Xbox One&#8217;s software lineup.</p>\n<p>[h/t <em><a href=\"http://ift.tt/13h6Arr\">SlashGear</a></em>]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
