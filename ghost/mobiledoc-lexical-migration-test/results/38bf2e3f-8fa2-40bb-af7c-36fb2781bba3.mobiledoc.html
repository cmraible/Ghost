<hr>
<p>Produced for just three years from 1968 through 1970, the AMC AMX is a GT-style muscle car with two seats and a short wheelbase. AMC, or American Motors Corporation, designed the car with a steel body, a first since the 1955-1957 Ford Thunderbird. With the Chevrolet Corvette as the model's only direct competitor, the AMX had a one-inch shorter wheelbase than the 'Vette and was priced considerably less. Flexing plenty of muscle crammed into such a small package, the AMC AMX is ready to throw down with the best of them.

<p>Sprayed in a bright blue hue, this incredible <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1970-amc-amx/">'70 AMC AMX</a> is the result of meticulous restoration that has it in better shape than when it was fresh off the assembly line. Called "Big Bad Blue", this two-door hardtop is ready to turn heads no matter where you go. Open the doors to reveal a blue interior that is in fantastic condition.</p>
<p>Powering this small muscle car is a 390-cubic-inch V8 engine that generates 325-horsepower and is backed by an automatic transmission. According to the listing on Hemmings, the mileage states 71,062 but is exempt.</p>
<p>The 1970 model year was the final production year for the AMX, and it was given a mild facelift to resemble the past two model years. Although the redesign was considered mild, the car still had enough differences to be its own separate design. These changes included a new front end design that featured a longer hood complete with a "power blister" and two large openings that forced cold air into the engine bay. Other differences included the new flush grille that incorporated the headlamps, a revised rear end, full-width taillights, side marker lights shared with other AMC models, and a single center-mounted backup light. The 97-inch wheelbase remained the same, but the overall body length was extended by about two inches.</p>
