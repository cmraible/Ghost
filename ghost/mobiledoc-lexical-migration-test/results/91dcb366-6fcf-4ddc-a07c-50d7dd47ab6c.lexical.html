<p>Not all <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic cars</a> have been created equal, a fact which has its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/collector-cars-15k/">good and bad points</a>. A potent example of the fact is this ’53 Cadillac Series 62. For many, a Series 62 is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/enter-to-win-these-dream-giveaway-corvettes/">dream car</a>, something they plan to purchase <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-chevelle-ls6/">once they’ve “made it” in life</a>. If you’re going to treat yourself for a job well done, this particular Caddie is the way to do it.</p>

<p>The pictures haven’t been edited to make this American classic look nearly flawless – that’s how it is in real life. Previously kept in a private collection and maintained professionally, there’s little doubt it was a prized possession of the previous owner. Now it’s your chance to care meticulously for this museum-grade beauty.</p>

<p>Just walking around the exterior of this Series 62, people are going to be picking up their jaws. Flawless light blue paint, straight body panels, correct wire wheels, whitewall tires, and a tan convertible top all look absolutely flawless. GM hadn’t gone into its full-blown chrome obsession in 1952, so the shiny stuff is used sparingly on this Caddie. However, every inch covered in chrome looks perfect. You will get many longingly stares just cruising through town.</p>

<p>That same impeccable presentation is on full display for the interior as well. Factory-correct details abound, from the gauges and controls to the radio and clock in the dash. Two-tone blue upholstery, fresh carpeting, and everything else has been one up to the nines.</p>

<p>Even the original 331ci V8 engine is in fabulous condition, along with the automatic transmission. This is a true turn-key investment-grade classic car.</p>
