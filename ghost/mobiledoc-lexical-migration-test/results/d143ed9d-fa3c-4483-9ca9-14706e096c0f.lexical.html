<p><a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/623/2007-chevrolet-corvette-z06">GM built</a> the sixth-gen Corvette to be a competitor on the road and track. It was designed with everything in mind to turn it into a dominating machine. This particular example, from Crown Concepts, takes that engineering much further, for a quadruple digit build.</p>
<p><a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/623/2007-chevrolet-corvette-z06">Powering this beautiful</a> monster is a LS7, built for pure power. The 427 cubic inch engine is a monster from the factory, and this LS7 has some modifications to make it even more dangerous for the competition. The engine is backed by a single mass. flywheel and lightweight, high-capacity clutch which channels torque toward the rear transaxle. The six-speed manual transmission is beefed up to handle the extra horsepower, with modifications like a transmission cooler.</p>
<p><a href="https://inventory.crownconceptsusa.com/vehicles/623/2007-chevrolet-corvette-z06">The transmission</a> feeds into a limited slip differential, with enlarged ring and pinion gears. Stronger axle half-shafts with tougher universal joints transmit power to the rear wheels. It’s also equipped with high-intensity discharge lighting, fog lamps, leather seating, dual-zone air conditioning, cabin air filtration and head-up display (HUD) with track mode and g-meter are included.</p>
