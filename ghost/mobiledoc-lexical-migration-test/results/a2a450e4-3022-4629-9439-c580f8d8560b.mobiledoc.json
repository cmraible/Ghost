Gaining the reputation for the outlaw Bandit’s choice for his cross-country bootlegging antics, the car quickly became an instant classic and soon an entire culture surrounding the car began to appear."

It is very rare that you ever see one in poor condition due to the love that is present in these cars. So it is naturally quite interesting to see this beautiful black 78’ Trans-Am being pulled from the ashes of the barn-find world."

On the odometer you’ll mind the mileage to be roughly 79,000 miles, of course, is the original numbers matching the engine and transmission which came in the car from the factory. The current owner says that the car doesn't run, however, this is in large part because it hasn't been started since 1988 when it was parked there. Actually, the owner hasn't even so much as tried to start the engine as he knows that it surely won't start due to its long-standing slumber."
