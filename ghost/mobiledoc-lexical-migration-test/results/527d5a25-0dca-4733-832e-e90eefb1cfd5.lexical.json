Brought to us by Platinum Games and published by Nintendo, players take control of the titular Umbra Witch in this fast-paced, character action game as she beats and shoots her way through her obstacles and enemies, and looks sexy doing it. So get your guns, all four of them, and get ready for Bayonetta for “Colour Your World.”",

It’s a wonderfully balanced, yet powerful mechanic that novice players can use to deal with pesky enemies they are having trouble with, and advanced players can use to pull off stylish and high damage combos when they master the mechanic. Each weapon is paired with a demon, and they both have a dedicated skill tree with a lot of additional moves to unlock, making every weapon and demon feel robust and individual.",

Bayonetta has an arsenal of weapons and Viola only has one, but she can do a lot with that one weapon. Viola also focuses on parrying, rather than Bayonetta’s dodging. While Viola can dodge, she activates her Witch Time (bullet time) through parrying, unlike Bayonetta. Lastly, when Viola summons her demon, Cheshire, you still keep control of her while Cheshire acts on its own, however you do lose your sword and use your fists instead. All in all, Viola is a wonderful addition, and a fun change to the game.",

Previously, they needed to make sure all hand weapons could combo effectively with all foot weapons, which likely restricted some creative ideas for attacks and combos. This way allows more freedom in developing, and gives a hand only weapon a heavy attack button, since she now doesn’t put her guns on her heels when using a large hammer gun.
