<p>For over six decades, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HillsboroughConcours/">Hillsborough Concours d’Elegance</a> has created the beautiful tradition of honoring and celebrating excellence in the automotive world in terms of design and engineering. Thanks to its dedicated volunteers, leaders, entrants, and attendees, Hillsborough has earned the title of being the longest continually running Concours event in the world.</p>
<p>This year's 64<sup>th</sup> annual Hillsborough Concours was held on the beautiful and lush green Crystal Springs Golf Course. The event brought a record 200-plus pristine vintage and classic cars and motorcycles. The weekend event took place from Friday, July 20, 2019, through Sunday, July 21, 2019. The festivities began on Friday with the annually sold-out Kick-Off Party, which featured Porsche racer and restorer Bruce Canepa. The Tour d'Elegance, a road rally for Concours participants and auto enthusiasts took place on Saturday, and the esteemed Concours d'Elegance was held on Sunday.</p>

<p>Hillsborough Concours d’Elegance Chairman Richard Kelaita says that this year's Concours featured the most diverse range of rare, priceless, and unique cars in the show's history.</p>
<p>“With competition at its peak, our judges determined that this beautiful <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=chrysler">Chrysler</a> truly represented the very finest from an extraordinary field of entries.”</p>
<p>Congratulations are in order for Larry Nannini and his wife Susan Nannini of Colma, California. The panel of expert judges chose his immaculate 1933 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=chrysler+imperial">Chrysler Imperial</a> LeBaron CL for the "Best of Show" award. It's not hard to see why, as it's truly a spectacular example of an American classic.</p>
<p>“Closed cars rarely win top honors, especially when the field was as competitive as it was on Sunday,” said Mr. Nannini, “We bought the car back in 2015 and spent a year restoring it.  The exceptional work of our restorer, Martin Hveem, attests to the car’s true beauty and distinction.”</p>
