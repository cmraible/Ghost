While that might not sound like much, BMW engineers turned to high compression pistons, Del Orto carburetors, plus a free-flow exhaust to extract a shocking 67-horsepower. That was enough to propel the bike to a top speed of 125 mph. The speed and overall handling capabilities of this bike were on full display when riders on the R90S grabbed first and second place in the Superbike class at Daytona in 1976, then Reg Pridmore snagged the championship using an R90S. You’ll appreciate that performance when riding on twisting, winding country roads, as well as the fact that everything mechanical is in excellent condition, so you don’t need to worry about becoming stranded.",
