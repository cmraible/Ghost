<p>On Wednesday, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/nancy-pelosi/">Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> insisted there was no reason sitting lawmakers and their spouses should be banned from trading stocks. “This is a free market,” she explained. “We're a free-market economy and they should be able to participate in that.”</p>
<p>Pelosi knows what she’s talking about — since she and her husband have benefited greatly from participating in that free-market economy.</p>

<p>“Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be lied to. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.” — Octavia Butler, <em>Parable of the Talents</em></p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://wir2022.wid.world/www-site/uploads/2021/12/Summary_WorldInequalityReport2022_English.pdf">World Inequality 2022 Report</a> reveals the poorest half of the world’s population owns just two percent of total global wealth, while the<strong> top 10 percent owns 76 percent</strong>. According to the report’s authors, “Between 1995 and 2021, the top 1% captured 38% of the global increment in wealth… The share of wealth owned by the global top 0.1% rose from 7% to 11% over that period and global billionaire wealth soared.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday, when asked whether sitting members of Congress and their spouses should be banned from trading individual stocks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1471152961577439234">said</a> no. “This is a free market,” she explained. “We're a free-market economy and they should be able to participate in that.”</p>
<p>Pelosi, whose husband <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/08/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-husband-paul-big-tech-stocks/">periodically</a><a href="https://nbc25news.com/news/nation-world/pelosi-bought-tesla-stock-weeks-before-biden-rolled-out-electric-vehicle-plan">trades</a> millions of dollars worth of stock options, is worth at least <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthiest-members-congress-house-senate-finances-2021-12?op=1&scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4#15-rep-nancy-pelosi-a-democrat-from-california-46123051-11">$46 million</a>, according to <em>Insider</em>. She has faced scrutiny before for her family’s trading decisions. In 2012, Pelosi was the subject of a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-trading-stock-on-inside-information/"><em>60 Minutes</em> investigation</a><em></em>looking into whether members of Congress were trading stocks on inside information.</p>
<p>The show noted that “Pelosi and her husband have participated in at least eight IPOs. One of those came in 2008, from Visa, just as a troublesome piece of legislation that would have hurt credit card companies began making its way through the House. Undisturbed by a potential conflict of interest, the Pelosis purchased 5,000 shares of Visa at the initial price of $44. Two days later it was trading at $64. The credit card legislation never made it to the floor of the House.”</p>
<p>When <em>60 Minutes</em> asked Pelosi if it was a conflict of interest to participate in the Visa IPO while serving as speaker, Pelosi responded, “No, it was not.” </p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CONSULTANTS CASHED IN FROM WORKING FOR BOTH CANDIDATES AND SUPER PACS: </strong>The Supreme Court justices that signed the disastrous 2010 <em>Citizens United </em>ruling argued it was okay to allow third-party organizations to spend unlimited amounts on elections because there was an “absence of prearrangement and coordination” between outside groups and candidates. But on Wednesday, consumer watchdog group Public Citizen published a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/DualAgents2.pdf">report</a> that detailed more than 200 instances of political consulting firms working concurrently for candidates and super PACs in the same election. According to the report, the firms listed received $1.4 billion in total for their services over the past two election cycles. The report’s author, Taylor Lincoln, noted this situation would be prohibited under Democrats’ voting rights legislation, the “The Freedom to Vote Act.”</li>
    <li><strong>EU MOVES TOWARD STRONGER GIG ECONOMY WORKER RIGHTS: </strong>Last week, the European Commission, which is responsible for crafting European Union (EU) legislation, released a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6605">directive</a> proposing measures to improve the conditions of digital platform workers — people using an app or website to provide a paid service to customers — across all 27 EU member states. The directive, if passed, <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/12/european-commission-eu-platform-workers-uber-employee-status-law">would change</a> the default legal status of platform workers to be the same as full-time employees — a shift that would provide these workers with the same labor rights currently accessible to most European workers. <em>Brave New Europe</em><a href="https://braveneweurope.com/eu-commission-employment-status-as-default-for-platform-workers">touted</a> the measures as “the most significant regulatory change to the gig economy since it began to emerge as a significant part of Europe’s economy around a decade ago.” According to the European Commission, there are currently 28 million platform workers across the continent — a number that is expected to grow to 43 million by 2025.</li>

    <li><strong>BIPARTISAN COALITION URGES GREATER SENATE TRANSPARENCY:</strong> Late last week, a group of 41 organizations and 15 experts <a href="https://demandprogress.org/put-senate-bills-and-amendments-online-before-votes/">released</a> a letter calling on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to make Senate legislation publicly available ahead of floor votes. The letter, spearheaded by Demand Progress and the Lincoln Network, is a response to the Senate occasionally holding floor votes on bills and amendments without publishing the text on its website beforehand. “Transparency is a key aspect of democratic legitimacy and public participation in the legislative process… privileged access to public business that currently is the subject of floor debate should be minimized to the extent practically possible,” noted the letter’s authors.</li>
    <li><strong>TOP OUTSOURCING FIRM COMMITS WIDESPREAD MIGRANT WAGE THEFT: </strong>A new Economic Policy Institute report <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/new-evidence-widespread-wage-theft-in-the-h-1b-program/">highlights stolen wages</a> to the tune of $95 million by HCL Technologies, an India-based IT staffing firm that profits off of slotting H-1B visa holders into corporations like Disney, Google, and FedEx.<strong></strong>The report finds that thousands of migrants working as subcontractors at these companies through the visa program have been grossly underpaid, despite federal law requiring employers to pay these workers the same amount as their U.S. counterparts. “This apparent blatant lawbreaking by one of the leading H-1B outsourcing companies should finally prompt action by the federal government to curb abuses of the H-1B program so that it can operate fairly for both migrant workers and U.S. workers,” <a href="https://www.epi.org/press/new-epi-report-reveals-wage-theft-on-a-grand-scale-in-the-h-1b-visa-program/">said</a> Daniel Costa, EPI director of immigration law and policy research and co-author of the report.</li>
