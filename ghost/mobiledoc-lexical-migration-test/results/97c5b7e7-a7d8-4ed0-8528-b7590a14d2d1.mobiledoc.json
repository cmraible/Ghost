If you live in Washington state there’s a good explanation: police are almost powerless to stop criminals as they run away. Many suspects fleeing from law enforcement are behind the wheel of stolen cars, so running the tags won’t lead to a capture."

Thanks to new laws passed by the state’s legislature in the wake of cries for defunding the police and scaling back their powers, criminals are taking advantage and ignoring law enforcement. What’s better, the situation is almost guaranteed to get worse."

Supposedly these new rules are to keep everyone safe, but the suspect was already engaging in dangerous maneuvers before the trooper tried pulling him over, then engaged in even more to ensure he wouldn’t be chased. It’s almost like the law is incentivizing criminals to break the law."

The guy called 911 and told the dispatcher they had to call off the chase because of House Bill 1054. He refused to stop, believing the law was on his side."
