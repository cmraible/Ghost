Very few world leaders actually do the tweeting themselves. Those that do are normally in northern Europe, on the shores of the Baltic Sea – the [Estonian President](https://twitter.com/ilvestoomas), and the [Finnish Prime Minister](https://twitter.com/alexstubb), for example. The president of Malaysia is very good at selfies – which are far more engaging than the traditional handshake shots:\n\n> My selfie with President Obama ! [pic.twitter.com/mr94wZtmuA](http://t.co/mr94wZtmuA)— Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) [April 27, 2014](https://twitter.com/NajibRazak/status/460289899791253504)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nForeign ministers – in Europe in particular – will use Twitter to make concessions. They @reply each other, they follow each other, and it appears that they direct message each other. Laurent Fabius is the best connected minister at the moment – but it’s his team doing it. Kudos to them, as they’re reaching out to other leaders.\n\n[Tweets by @LaurentFabius](https://twitter.com/LaurentFabius)<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script>\n\nIn the last year we’ve seen the rise of Twitter diplomacy – people attempting to use Twitter to gain influence. It’s becoming a digital battleground. How did the Russians respond to western allies using #unitedforukraine? They co-opted the hashtag.\n\nIn September things turned belligerent with NATO tweeting pictures of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, with a mocking response from Russian accounts. #RussiainvededUkraine led to the most retweeted tweet from the Ukraine government.\n\nSome of the behaviour is trolling. Thomas Hendrik Ilves gets heavy trolling. The Latvian foreign minster came out on Twitter:\n\n> I proudly announce I'am gay… Good luck all of you…\n\n— Edgars Rinkēvičs (@edgarsrinkevics) [November 6, 2014](https://twitter.com/edgarsrinkevics/status/530450808132108288)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nMost response were supportive, but one Russian one mocked. We’ve come perilously close to declarations of war on Twitter – and we’re clearly seeing political posturing.\n\nThe age of Twitter diplomacy is here.\n\n\n## Further reading\n\nYou can follow Matthias’s digital diplomacy work on Twitter:\n\n[Follow @twiplomacy](https://twitter.com/twiplomacy)<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>\n\nMatthias himself:\n\n[Follow @luefkens](https://twitter.com/luefkens)<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>\n\nBurston-Marstler has [a Twiplomacy site](http://twiplomacy.com)  \n*Like the liveblogging?
