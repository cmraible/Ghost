<p>Republicans in Washington are threatening to blow up the United States‚Äô economy unless Democrats agree to shrink the social safety net by adding work requirements to programs such as food assistance and healthcare. They are billing the effort ‚Äî which would help corporations grow an exploitable workforce ‚Äî as necessary to end dependency, boost the economy, and reduce the federal deficit. </p>
<p>In doing so, GOP lawmakers are following the agenda pushed by an obscure conservative think tank bankrolled by far-right billionaires and activists that was behind a recent slew of state bills rolling back child labor laws across the country. The effort comes several years after the GOP passed massive, <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tax-cut-and-spending-bill-could-cost-55-trillion-through-2029">deficit-busting</a> tax cuts benefiting the wealthy and corporations ‚Äî and as the party <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-05-23-republican-debt-ceiling-lies/">pushes</a> to make those tax cuts permanent, at an estimated cost of <a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/05-16-2023/democrats-cbo-trump-tax-cut-debt/">$3.5 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>In effect, Republicans want to force Americans in poverty to pick up the tab for the tax cuts they gave to their wealthy donors, while giving those donors more vulnerable workers to exploit.</p>
<p>Republicans are attempting to ram through the think tank‚Äôs agenda by refusing to raise the debt ceiling, an arbitrary limit set by Congress on how much money the federal government can borrow, unless Democrats accept sweeping spending cuts and expanded work requirements on social programs.</p>

<p>The government is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/opinion/debt-limit-congress-biden-mccarthy.html">constitutionally</a> required to pay its debts and meet its <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2023-05-22-debt-ceiling-is-unconstitutional/">contractual</a> obligations, and almost every Congress for the past century has voted to raise the debt ceiling without incident. But with divided control of Congress and Joe Biden as president, Republicans want to use the imminent threat of the U.S. defaulting on its debts and an economic <a href="https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-congress-world-economy-recession-biden-52df635e9b89f4b1677176fc8d59eff0#:~:text=US%20DEBT%2C%20LONG%20VIEWED%20AS%20ULTRA%2DSAFE&text=A%20default%20could%20shatter%20the,and%20ignite%20an%20international%20crisis.">recession</a> as an opportunity to punish the poor.</p>
<p>Last month, House Republicans passed debt ceiling legislation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/politics/mccarthy-debt-limit-bill/index.html">proposed</a> by Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that would massively cut <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/08/upshot/federal-budget-republicans.html">government spending</a> on social safety net programs ‚Äî including Medicaid, food stamps, and cash assistance, known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).</p>
<p>The proposal would subject most Medicaid recipients between the ages of 19 and 55 without dependent children to a work requirement, forcing them to work for at least 80 hours a month or earn a minimum monthly salary to remain eligible. The new requirements likely would cause <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-work-a-look-at-what-the-data-say/">millions</a><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/mccarthy-medicaid-proposal-puts-millions-of-people-in-expansion-states-at-risk-of">of low-income</a> Americans to lose Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>The plan would also expand food stamp and TANF work requirements to adults aged 49 to 55, which could kick <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/house-republicans-agriculture-appropriations-bill-would-cut-wic-benefits">one million</a> people off the food assistance program and more than <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/5-4-23fis.pdf">half a million families</a> off cash assistance.</p>
<p>Study after study has shown that work requirements <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/work-requirements-sound-good-evidence-just-doesnt-support-them">have</a><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsr1901772">no impact</a> on <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58199#_idTextAnchor027">long-term</a> employment outcomes, but they do kick eligible people out of social programs due to administrative burdens and make them poorer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we talk about work requirements, remember, we want to take people from poverty to jobs,‚Äù McCarthy <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2023/05/22/speaker_mccarthy_on_debt_negotiations_its_not_right_to_borrow_money_from_china_to_pay_someone_to_sit_on_a_couch.html#:~:text=%22When%20we%20talk%20about%20work,a%20couch%2C%22%20McCarthy%20said.">told reporters</a> on Monday, adding: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that we borrow money from China to pay somebody that has no dependents, [is] able-bodied, to sit on a couch. What we find is people become more productive.‚Äù</p>
<p>McCarthy‚Äôs work requirement proposal and his gripes about dependency come straight from the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA), a conservative think tank that recently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/23/child-labor-lobbying-fga/">made headlines</a> for helping secretly draft several state bills to roll back child labor laws.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&ba=sf542">bill in Iowa</a> would allow 14-year-old kids to ‚Äúperform non-incidental work in meat freezers‚Äù and 15-year-olds to perform ‚Äúlight assembly work as long as the assembly is not performed on machines or in an area with machines,‚Äù <em>NBC News</em><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-child-labor-bill-iowa-may-violate-federal-law-rcna85321">reported</a>. The bill, which has not yet been signed by the governor, ‚Äúappears to violate‚Äù federal labor laws, according to Labor Department officials.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWork requirements will help get Americans out of dependency and back to work, preserving resources for the truly needy,‚Äù <a href="https://thefga.org/press/fga-applauds-speaker-mccarthy-and-house-republicans-for-bold-debt-ceiling-negotiations/">said</a> the FGA‚Äôs president and CEO Tarren Bragdon when House Republicans introduced their debt ceiling proposal. ‚ÄúThere has never been a better time to get able-bodied adults back into the workforce.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bragdon, a former Maine state legislator, founded the organization in 2011 during the Tea Party‚Äôs austerity push as part of the last major debt ceiling standoff, when Republicans demanded significant spending cuts.</p>

<p>One week before Republicans released their current debt ceiling proposal, the FGA released new polling in favor of work requirements. On April 11, the FGA‚Äôs <a href="https://excellenceinpolling.com/poll/federal-work-requirements-and-government-spending-poll/">polling arm</a> published data showing that more than 70 percent of likely voters support expanded work requirements for cash welfare benefits and food stamps, as well as new work requirements on Medicaid.</p>
<p>The following week, McCarthy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/politics/mccarthy-debt-limit-bill/index.html">proposed</a> expanding work requirements for food stamps and TANF, and imposing new work requirements on Medicaid in his debt ceiling package.</p>
<p>The FGA then put out a <a href="https://thefga.org/research/house-proposed-work-requirements/">white paper</a> claiming that ‚ÄúHouse Republicans‚Äô proposal for Medicaid and food stamp work requirements will increase the labor force and boost the national economy,‚Äù on the basis that ‚Äúmoving just four million able-bodied adults from welfare to work would increase real GDP by an estimated $149 billion.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lobbying records show the FGA‚Äôs advocacy arm, the Opportunity Solutions Project, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/17ef10c5-6bd5-41fc-a6b7-0c22413c5198/print/">started lobbying </a>Congress on work requirements in 2017. In the first quarter of 2023, the group <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e154e521-195c-4219-819e-1d9d603ca559/print/">spent</a> $130,000 on lobbying, including on food stamp reform, work requirements, and TANF, according to federal records reviewed by the <em>Lever.</em></p>
<p>The FGA and its advocacy arm have been bankrolled by right-wing groups in the dark money network built by conservative Supreme Court architect Leonard Leo, and also receive huge money from the family foundation of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/uline-uihlein-election-denial">cardboard box magnate</a> and conservative megadonor Dick Uihlein.</p>
<p>Between 2019 and 2021, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/otherposts/the-gops-dark-money-court-machine/">Leo‚Äôs</a><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21033638/concord-fund-2019-990.pdf">network</a><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21164749/the-85-fund-2020-990.pdf">contributed</a> nearly $4 million to the FGA and its advocacy arm, according to tax records reviewed by <em>The Lever.</em></p>
<p>Uihlein‚Äôs foundation has contributed nearly $18 million to the FGA since 2014, according to <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Foundation_for_Government_Accountability#Funding">data</a> from the Center for Media and Democracy.</p>
<p>Other major donors to the FGA have included the billionaire Scaife family, heirs to the Mellon aluminum and banking fortune, and DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund ‚Äî or pass-through vehicle ‚Äî long known as conservatives‚Äô <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/donors-trust-donor-capital-fund-dark-money-koch-bradley-devos/">‚Äúdark money ATM.‚Äù</a> (Leo‚Äôs network donated <a href="__GHOST_URL__/leonard-leos-latest-supreme-court-play/">$71 million</a> to DonorsTrust in 2021.)</p>
<p>In 2018, the FGA <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/05/18/theyre-the-think-tank-pushing-for-welfare-work-requirements-republicans-say-theyre-experts-economists-call-it-junk-science/">was behind</a> a GOP push to attach work requirements to food stamps ‚Äî which was passed by House Republicans but failed in the Senate. ‚ÄúPolitical observers said the inclusion of proposed changes to food stamps was testimony to the FGA‚Äôs growing influence in key Republican circles,‚Äù the <em>Washington Post </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/05/18/theyre-the-think-tank-pushing-for-welfare-work-requirements-republicans-say-theyre-experts-economists-call-it-junk-science/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, the FGA and its affiliates have crusaded to eliminate the temporary augmentation of social safety net programs enacted by congressional COVID relief bills ‚Äî like expanded child tax credits, unemployment benefits, and food stamps.</p>
<p>The FGA noted in its 2021 <a href="https://thefga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FGA-Annual-Report-2021.pdf">annual report</a> that it had ‚Äúleveraged our relationships with governors to help states opt out of the $300 unemployment bonus and build momentum for this federal program to end in September 2021.‚Äù</p>
<p>The organization wrote that it had also ‚Äúcapitalized on our work in West Virginia and connections with Sen. Joe Manchin to show 1) the effectiveness of work requirements and 2) how the expanded child tax credit caused dependency, supply chain issues, and inflation problems.‚Äù</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://levernews.com/donate" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Donate To The Lever</a></div>
<p>Manchin, a coal baron turned corporate Democratic senator for West Virginia, reportedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-privately-raised-concerns-parents-would-use-child-tax-credit-n1286321">complained</a> to his colleagues that lazy parents would use their expanded child tax credit payments to buy drugs, and <a href="https://twitter.com/josephzeballos/status/1478409243703316493">demanded</a> that it include a work requirement, before <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/how-joe-manchin-killed-biden-s-child-tax-credit-n1294320">blocking</a> its reauthorization altogether.</p>
<p>Census research found that the expanded child tax credit lifted nearly <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html">three million children</a> out of poverty, though temporarily.</p>
<p>This spring, the FGA‚Äôs Opportunity Solutions Project was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/state-republicans-want-requirements-those-035900513.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKpYtIwzCH9wZCB57RzLsiuMXl8zHRUmP4adMqYexcLjwLbkBPfMX7K4Mj9foJAN-ahxJCiWJSe74fo2_CZt1TIMQIgu66Q3l7OzSOvu7c72IYIsTET3hpS3rRCS00Yr1u9GNO4m6s6UXdsCjDrnTjU7sHRmK_ubnLRQkdLJkH5h">the only group</a> backing legislation in Maine to add work requirements to Medicaid.The FGA also pushed to restart Medicaid redeterminations, or administrative checks on beneficiaries‚Äô eligibility, which often result in people <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-coming-medicaid-purge/">wrongfully losing coverage</a> because they miss a piece of mail. Redeterminations were temporarily paused during the pandemic, but the federal government recently allowed states to start conducting them again.</p>
