<p>I always like a game with an interesting gameplay concept, especially one that doesn't try to overcomplicate itself. Controlling swarms of units may seem daunting at first, but <em>Sea Salt</em> does it in a way that is simple and yet, surprisingly engaging. Each swarm has their own stats; these include Type (ranged, melee, etc.), Health, Attack, Speed, Horror (how likely your enemies are to flee in terror at the sight of them) and Amount (meaning how many you add to your swarm in a single purchase).</p>
<p>As you progress through its linear levels, you'll onlock new cards that contain new creatures to your swarm. And how do you do this, you may ask; well, my eager friend, you simply use the gold that you collect along your rampaging way to purchase more, to which you can choose from the list of cards you have obtained.</p>
<p><em>Sea Salt</em> has a Victorian Gothic motif which is always fun to explore in video games. A common theme explored in media that takes this era as inspiration is religion and this game is no exception. It explores these themes with almost cult-like curiousity with the plot of a worshipped sea beast called Dagan who has its controlled minions to wreak havoc after the Archbishop cowardly refuses its request for his life as sacrifice. </p>
<p>The art is heightens these dark themes with wonderfully illustrated gothic scenery and as each card comes in the form of a tarot card, the illustrations accurately depicts acts of the macabre. In addition, the harrowingly gruesome sound effects are eerily satisfying as you hear the crunch of your victims' bones get gnawed on by the creatures of darkness... excuse while I call my therapist.</p>

<p>The gameplay hook is certainly unique but after a while, I found myself wanting more variety. Special attacks, abilities or even dash could have provided more strategy to approaching combat. Luckily, the game doesn't overstay its welcome as it can be completed within five hours, to which I could tell that if it went on for any longer, the combat would have grown to become monotonous.</p>
<p>With so much going on at once, you'll find yourself moving the cursor around frantically in order to cover the most ground. This then brings up the issue of the camera sometimes either not keeping up or stopping once your swarm starts chowing on some victims; the downside to this is that when the camera stops and your swarm (and the victim) are on the edge of the screen, you can't quite tell what's coming out of the camera's view. I lost many good men this way, RIP Worm #27 - I salute you.</p>
<p>While <em>Sea Salt</em>'s art style and aesthetic are certainly to be praised, their individual sprites (due to the chaos that the game is based around) can sometimes be difficult to discern from each other. This may not be a bad thing at first when you're simply flailing your swarm around the place but when you can't tell whether there's an enemy you can attack amongst your swarm and by the time you've realised, they've escaped from your grasp.</p>

<p>There's certainly been a resurgance in the reverse horror genre as of late and <em>Sea Salt</em> is a dreadfully wonderful addition.</p>
