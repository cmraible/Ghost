<p>Craig Mod on the <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/">appeal of newsletters</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Ownership is the critical point here. Ownership in email in the same way we own a paperback: We recognize that we (largely) control the email subscriber lists, they are portable, they are not governed by unknowable algorithmic timelines.<a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/#fn:algoemail" rel="footnote"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> And this isn’t ownership yoked to a company or piece of software operating on quarterly horizon, or even multi-year horizon, but rather to a half-century horizon. Email is a (the only?) networked publishing technology with both widespread, near universal adoption,<a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/#fn:devworld" rel="footnote"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a><em>and</em> history. It is, as they say, <em>proven</em>.</blockquote>
<p>This is an infinitely more eloquent expression of what I was exploring when <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/02/newsletters-versus-blogs/">I talked of email being the cockroach of the internet</a>. (Mod's writing is consistently measured and beautiful that it makes me want to crawl away and run a B&B or something…)</p>
<p>Mod has some insightful points about the tone of newsletters, too:</p>
<blockquote>This intimacy — both from my side and that of the recipients — seems to engender a kind of vulnerability that I haven’t found elsewhere online. But the intimacy is not surprising: the <em>conversation</em> is one-to-one even though the distribution is one-to-many.</blockquote>
<p>Newsletters work best with a strong sense of a human writing for a human. A message arrives, direct to <em>your </em>inbox<em>, </em>even in thousands are also receiving it. A voice that you become familiar with emerges — in a similar way to the best podcasts. </p>
<p>As with blogging, those who are most successful in this medium will be those who can explore and find the right tone of voice, rather than ramming a standard journalistic voice into a different medium. This vulnerable, connective tone is something many journalists struggle with — it's very much <em>not </em>how we're trained to write — but it's critical to creating engaging work online. </p>
<p>One thought: does the very fact that it's challenging to make a newsletter go viral — there's no easy way of sharing it on to a mass of people — encourage both more vulnerability in the author, and more reflection in the reader? </p>
