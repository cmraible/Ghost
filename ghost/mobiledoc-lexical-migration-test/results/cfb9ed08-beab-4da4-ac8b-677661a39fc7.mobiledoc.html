<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1967-pontiac-firebird/">Pontiac Firebird</a> was a pony car created by the Pontiac division of General Motors to rival the Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar. Introduced on February 23, 1967, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/carve-your-dream-car-into-halloween/">Firebird</a> debuted simultaneously with its platform-sharing relative, the Chevrolet Camaro. The Mercury Cougar was also introduced at this time. The Pontiac Firebird was produced from 1967 through 2002 model years through four generations. The Firebirds were powered by Pontiac engines until 1977 but was given several different V8 engines from almost every General Motors division until 1982. </p>
<h3 id="first-generation-1967-1969-">First-Generation (1967 - 1969)</h3>
<p>The <strong>first-generation Pontiac Firebird</strong> featured "coke-bottle" styling with bumpers integrated into the front end along with GTO-inspired slit-styled taillights. Pontiac wanted to produce a sports car based on the original Banshee concept car, but GM didn't want the car competing with the Corvette. Instead, Pontiac revised Chevy's F-body platform for an all-new pony car.</p>
