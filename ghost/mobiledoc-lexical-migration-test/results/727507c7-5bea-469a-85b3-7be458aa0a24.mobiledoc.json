In fact, the seller states this Chevy sat in a controlled environment for the past 10 years, helping to explain its amazing state."

The fact this one has the original engine is somewhat unique, considering many do swaps on these trucks in the quest for more power. To access the engine, you open the alligator hood, which was quite the big deal when this truck first debuted."

Among the classic design elements is a two-piece windshield and those Chevrolet dog dish hubcaps. You’ll also note the front fender vents, which are subtle but add so much to this truck. The use of brightwork is restrained, consisting mostly of the bumpers, grille, and headlight bezels, but there’s a nice mirror finish to these components. Wood boards fixed in the payload don’t show signs of excessive weathering, which is a nice plus."

          "With WWII over and Chevy no longer making military vehicles, it turned its attention to producing “Advance Design” pickups. These were longer, wider, and lower than what the brand had made before, with an overall more modern design. The combination of durability, dependability, and modern looks made Chevy a juggernaut in the truck market, allowing it to easily dominate Ford, even with the new F-series models launching. As a result, restoring or even converting one of these trucks into a street rod is pretty straightforward."
