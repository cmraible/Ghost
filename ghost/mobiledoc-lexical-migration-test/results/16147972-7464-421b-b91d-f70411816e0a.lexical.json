When I meet a Labour voter who can only hiss, stamp and fume at any Tory, or a Conservative voter who can only jeer and condemn a Labour voter then I bridle, bristle and simply writhe with indignation. Let this be known and celebrated: we all have the right to vote the way we want. We all have our reasons and motivations and they do not justify anyone insulting or reviling us.\n\n*Marvellous*.\n\n</div> \n\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\">[![Reblog this post [with Zemanta]](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2010/05/reblog_c7.png?w=960)](http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/e4ca315d-23c8-423d-aff4-75976bb9e5e3/ \"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\")<span class=\"zem-script pretty-attribution\">  \n<script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>  \n</span></div>\n"
