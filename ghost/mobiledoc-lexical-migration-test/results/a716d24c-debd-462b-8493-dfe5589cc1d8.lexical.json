Thankfully, some thought it would be better to preserve the machines which helped stem the tide of authoritarianism in the world. Many of those, like this one featured in the video, were stashed away in sheds, garages, barns, and yes even basements. They sat unridden for decades, but as a testament to their battle-hardened design, these old Harleys have withstood the ravages of time surprisingly well.",

There’s a nice patina on it, the seat looks to be pretty much done, but the real question is how well will all the mechanicals run for such a journey? This is a far cry from taking a newly acquired bike for a spin around the neighborhood, which often leads to pushing it home. Check out the video to see how it all goes down.",
