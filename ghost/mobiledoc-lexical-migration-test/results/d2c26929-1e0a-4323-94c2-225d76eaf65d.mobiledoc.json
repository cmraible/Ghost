          " have come out of the Italian automotive industry over the last century or so. However, there are pretty much three big names, which are seemingly in constant competition, that people remember. One of those three is Maserati, a brand known for making incredibly unique cars both in their style and performance capabilities. Recently, a Maserati MC 20 has come onto the market looking for its next driver and you might just want to consider this."

          "One of the first things you’ll notice about the vehicle is how well it handles the color scheme. Very few cars get painted yellow and come out looking good on the other side. This vehicle’s vibrance and borderline arrogant confidence that the exterior portrays fits the car incredibly well. On top of that, the car is quite long and wide making it take up a significant portion of the road. This is also a really great configuration for track fun as you get maximum traction."

          "That traction is definitely necessary as the engine bag holds one of the best power houses seen by the Italian manufacturer. A 3.0-liter  V6 makes power with the help of a TwinTurbo charging system. Needless to say, it’s pretty fun stepping on the gas and getting all 538 ft/lbs of torque hitting the ground as the 621 hp allows for a smooth transition to top speed of well over 200 mph. Overall, this vehicle perfectly represents what Italian sports cars were always meant to be, good looking and fast."
