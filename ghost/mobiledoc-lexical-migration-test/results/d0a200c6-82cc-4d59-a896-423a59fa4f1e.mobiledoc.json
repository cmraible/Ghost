The naturally-aspirated 4.2-liter inline-six diesel engine is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, a combination many would consider something out of a dream. There’s also a 2-speed transfer case."

To fit all that rubber, the Toyota has a 2-inch Ironman suspension lift with Foam Cell Pro shock absorbers installed. A custom fuel tank skid plate helps guard against damage. That front bumper is also from Ironman and it features LED auxiliary lighting for when the sun goes down and you’re still out on the trail."

There’s carpeting and the removable top has a headliner, making it more comfortable. The wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel and aluminum shift knob add a nice touch. A double-DIN Clarion stereo has been installed as well."
