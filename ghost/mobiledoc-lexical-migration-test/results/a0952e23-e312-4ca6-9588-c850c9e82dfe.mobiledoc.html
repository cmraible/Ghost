<p>C.A. Tilt was a shoemaker by trade, but would go on to found the Diamond T Company in 1905. It started off as a company meant to produce four-cylinder touring cars and limos, but would find that selling trucks and commercial vehicles was more lucrative. This particular example from the company is a <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308400">1948 Diamond T Model 201</a> from Henderson Auctions, which is a fine example from the era.</p>
