<p><a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1970-chevelle-ss">This 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS</a> is nothing short of a muscle car masterpiece and it is exactly as it was intended to be. It features its 396-cid big block engine that was installed while the car was still new, an original paint code finish, and an expertly executed restoration. Backing the big block powerhouse is a Muncie M20 4-speed manual transmission that feeds into a 12-bolt rear end with positraction and a 3.31:1 gear ratio. Running over the top of a functional cowl-induction hood is a pair of black stripes and the correct <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1970-chevelle-ss">Super Sport</a> badging finishes off the classic original look. This bold look could not be pulled off so well with any other color than Cranberry Red. </p>
