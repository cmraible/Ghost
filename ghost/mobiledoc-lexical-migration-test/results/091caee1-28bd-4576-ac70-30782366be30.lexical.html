<hr>
<p>Except for years when a new movie has debuted, <em>Star Wars</em> nerds... er, um, enthusiasts... look forward to one day: May 4th. Even if you're not into this movie franchise, we're pretty sure you will still enjoy this Dodge advertisement for 2015's <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>.</p>
<p>With the unmistakable imperial march theme blaring in the background, a black 2016 Dodge Viper ACR is seen leading a group of Challengers and Chargers doing their best Stormtrooper impersonation. It seems that just about all blacked-out, menacing sports cars get some sort of Darth Vader reference these days, but we're guessing if Lord Vader really drove a car, a 645-horsepower Viper with a massive chin spoiler and rear wing would probably be his best choice.</p>
<p>Just like the <em>Star Wars</em> saga, there is continued rumor about a sequel for the Viper, although there has been no official confirmation from Dodge to back this up as of yet. With a new era of high-performacne supercars like the C8 Corvette and Acura NSX, the market is ripe for a Viper rennaissance.</p>
<p>Viper production may have ended in 2017, but FCA hasn't left horsepower-craving enthusiasts out to dry. In recent years, just about all of Chrysler's divisions have received some sort of offering powered by the Hellcat engine. These include the Challenger and Charger, which seem to get new Hellcat variations every year, as well as the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. A rumored Dodge Durango Hellcat will be introduced later this year as will a Hellcat-powered pickup truck with the Ram Rebel TRX.</p>
