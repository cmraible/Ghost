Our concern is that readers take every measure they reasonably can to secure their rides because at this point, nobody is entirely safe from this crime trend. It has even affected a sports broadcaster who covers the Detroit Lions, his 1970 Chevelle SS now a goner. Even more shocking, the classic muscle car was sitting in his home garage when it all went down."

If you have a valuable ride in your garage, you might want to physically lock the track every night before you lock everything down. That might sound paranoid but it could be the difference between keeping your beloved car or waking up in the morning to find your garage is empty."

The interior has white leather upholstery, so this is a fairly distinct ride. Please be on the lookout, even if you’re not in the Detroit area. A lot of times thieves will drive their acquisitions to other regions, looking to pawn them off on someone unsuspecting."
