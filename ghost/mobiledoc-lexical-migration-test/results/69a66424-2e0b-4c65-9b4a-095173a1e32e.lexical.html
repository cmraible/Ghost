<p>The early generations of the <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/CH1022-523207/1965-chevrolet-corvette-convertible/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> were made with a personality you can't find with virtually any other car. It honestly could be said that if the original designers could have filled the engines up with liquid competitiveness instead of oil, they would have. But, of course, if you know the history of the American performance legend, you'll also know it was initially made to beat similarly priced European sports cars in the performance department.</p>

<p>Chevrolet really started to ramp up the <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/CH1022-523207/1965-chevrolet-corvette-convertible/">Corvette's performance</a> after the successes of the 327-cid engine and had it not been for a ridiculous GM rule limiting displacement based on vehicle size, the 1965 Corvettes high-performance option probably would have been a 427-cid engine. In fact, this single year only option produced almost as much horsepower as the following year's 427 engine. Unfortunately, this beastly 396 was wiped from the options list with the introduction of the 427.</p>
