<p>Good things are happening! The congressional staffer sit-in pushed Democratic leadership and the Senate to reopen negotiations on a significant climate spending package. As activist and philosopher Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò <a href="https://twitter.com/OlufemiOTaiwo/status/1552413985466621955">put it</a>, “action gets the goods.” Also, farmworkers in California join the state labor federation with assertive new leadership, solar power technology is cheaper than ever, and investigative journalism helped deliver the second largest redlining settlement in U.S. history.</p>

<p>Don’t let the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/07/27/manchin-says-he-has-reached-deal-with-democrats-economy-climate-bill/">corporate</a> media fool you into crediting Larry Summers for Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-W.Va.) reversal on the spending package, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/manchin-climate-tax-bill.html?referringSource=articleShare">allocates</a> $369 billion for climate and energy proposals. The legislation being considered, while a watered-down version of the Build Back Better Act, only exists because of the efforts of congressional progressives and organizers who have worked for years to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22120629-staff-climate-letter-to-biden-july-2022">demand</a> climate action.</p>

<h3 id="solar-power-is-cheaper-than-ever">Solar Power Is Cheaper Than Ever</h3>
<p>Between 2010 and 2020, the cost of solar power has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/opinion/environment/energy-crisis-oil-gas-fracking.html">fallen 90 percent</a>! According to climate change writer David Wallace-Wells, the cost of wind and battery power has fallen almost as much, while the fracking industry lost $300 billion in profits. Wallace-Wells noted that, “the viability of green energy creation has never been greater,” with the International Energy Agency announcing that “global investment in clean, green and renewable technologies [has] exceeded investment in fossil fuels for the first time, accounting for more than $1.4 trillion of the total global investment of $2.4 trillion.”</p>
<p>The rest of Wallace-Wells’ piece provides critical commentary on fracking and a green transition.</p>
<h3 id="farmworkers-join-the-california-labor-federation-s%C3%AD-se-puede">Farmworkers Join The California Labor Federation. Sí, Se Puede!</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, former <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-14/column-lorena-gonzalez-legislator-california-labor-federation">Assemblywoman</a> Lorena Gonzalez <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-27/california-farmworkers-lorena-gonzalez">became</a> the first woman of color to take over as the head of the California Labor Federation (CLF). Under Gonzalez’s leadership, the United Farm Workers (UFW) — the union started with support of icons like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta — will join the CLF.</p>
<p>“It is without a doubt a moment in the history of workers’ rights in the Golden State, which has long been less than golden for our most defenseless wage earners — those who pick crops, fry burgers and fill thousands of service and gig-industry jobs that offer as little in the way of wages as they do in workplace rights,” columnist Anita Chabria <a href="http://latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-27/california-farmworkers-lorena-gonzalez">wrote</a> for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>
<p>As UFW is down to roughly <a href="https://calmatters.org/projects/united-farm-workers-union/">7,000 members</a>, joining the CFL will connect their efforts to 1,200 other unions that represent 2.1 million workers!</p>
<p>Their new affiliation with the CLF comes as the labor movement in California and the nation gains new energy as it is increasingly led by young people of color and women.</p>
<p>On August 3, farm workers will start a 24-day, 335-mile "March for the Governor's Signature" from the UFW's historic Delano CA 40 Acres. The march will demand that California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sign <a href="https://ufw.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AB-2183-Fact-Sheet-3.2022.pdf">AB 2183</a>, a bill that would allow farm workers to vote for a union free from intimidation and threats.</p>
<p>You can sign the farm workers’ petition to Newsom <a href="https://act.seiu.org/a/33122petition?ms=w">here</a> and learn how to support the march <a href="https://ufw.org/caagvotingchoiceact2022/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-largest-redlining-settlement-in-us-history">The Second Largest Redlining Settlement In U.S. History</h3>
<p>A 2018 <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/warren-buffetts-mortgage-companies-set-up-to-cater-to-white-clients/?fbclid=IwAR2MMruT2X_07TGoA32Fp7t1XmfRc9blQgWJFmjol4w_c7oO7BQwf4rruro">investigation</a> started by journalists at <em>Reveal</em> exposed systematic discrimination<strong></strong>between 2015 and 2016 by <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/ag-shapiro-announces-major-settlement-with-former-top-mortgage-lender-over-allegations-of-redlining/">Warren Buffet’s lending companies</a>. The investigation found that lenders in the Philadelphia area were not making mortgage loans as readily available to borrowers of color as they were to white borrowers.</p>
<p>This week, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced a settlement of more than $20 million with the former top home mortgage lender, Trident Mortgage Company. “The deal requires Trident to provide individual subsidies of up to $10,000 in support of new mortgages for owner-occupied homes in majority-minority neighborhoods to qualified applicants.”</p>
<h3 id="trader-joe%E2%80%99s-workers-form-union">Trader Joe’s Workers Form Union</h3>
<p>Workers at Trader Joe’s in Hadley, Massachusetts, voted on Thursday to unionize. It is the first Trader Joe’s location out of 500 to win a formal union.</p>
<p>“This is historic, but not a surprise,” Trader Joe's United said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TraderJoesUnite/status/1552737467857600512">statement</a>. “Since the moment we announced our campaign, a majority of the crew have enthusiastically supported our union, and despite the company’s best efforts to bust us, our majority has never wavered.”</p>
<p>More Trader Joe’s workers in <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/27-RC-300124">Colorado</a> have filed an election petition this week, and another vote is set to happen next month at a location in <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-RC-298414">Minneapolis</a>.</p>

<p>Los Angeles could be the first major city in the U.S. to ban the construction of new gas stations as it considers how to make a green energy transition. Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Koretz, who drafted the policy, said in a <a href="https://www.stand.earth/latest/people-vs-big-oil/los-angeles-and-local-governments-across-us-and-canada-form-growing-wave">press release</a>, “We are ending oil drilling in Los Angeles. We are moving to all-electric new construction. And we are building toward fossil fuel-free transportation.” If approved, the measure would prevent additions to the 600 gas stations already in Los Angeles county.</p>

<p>The People vs. Fossil Fuels climate justice coalition is organizing an action: “Join a national day of action on August 2nd to demand that Biden declare a climate emergency and reject fossil fuels!* Actions can be big or small: the important thing is that we do them together and direct our demands at President Biden. We'll provide advice and support to help make your event a success. If you want to host an action but can't do it on August 2nd, aim for another day that week!”</p>

<h3 id="finally%E2%80%A6">Finally…</h3>
<p>After all the news this week, take some time to read Elizabeth Alexander’s poem about poetic force, <em>“</em><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53005/ars-poetica-100-i-believe"><em>Ars Poetica #100: I Believe</em></a><em>”</em>:<br></p>
<p><em>Poetry, I tell my students,</em></p>
<p><em>is idiosyncratic. Poetry</em><br></p>
<p><em>is where we are ourselves</em></p>
<p><em>(though Sterling Brown said</em><br></p>
<p><em>“Every ‘I’ is a dramatic ‘I’”),</em></p>
<p><em>digging in the clam flats</em><br></p>
<p><em>for the shell that snaps,</em></p>
<p><em>emptying the proverbial pocketbook.</em><br></p>
<p><em>Poetry is what you find</em></p>
<p><em>in the dirt in the corner,</em><br></p>
<p><em>overhear on the bus, God</em></p>
<p><em>in the details, the only way</em><br></p>
<p><em>to get from here to there.</em></p>
<p><em>Poetry (and now my voice is rising)</em><br></p>
<p><em>is not all love, love, love,</em></p>
<p><em>and I’m sorry the dog died.</em><br></p>
<p><em>Poetry (here I hear myself loudest)</em></p>
<p><em>is the human voice,</em><br></p>
<p><em>and are we not of interest to each other?</em></p>
