<hr>
<p>Monterey Car Week always brings out the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/monterey-car-week-auction-record/">heavy hitters</a>, and this year is certainly no exception. Bonhams will be auctioning off a gorgeous 1949 Talbot-Lago T26 Grand Sport Convertible during its event at the Quail Lodge & Golf Club on August 18 and the car is turning <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/monterey-car-week-expected-to-attract/">quite a few heads</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have to ask how much this classic vehicle will sell for, well you can’t afford it. The classic French car is rare, highly collectible, and something which probably won’t get the masses all worked up. But Talbot-Lago is known for having painstakingly crafted small batches of vehicles, making the brand legendary among the well-heeled collectors around the globe.</p>
<p>This particular model, the T26 Grand Sport, only reached 35 units of production. Out of those, a mere three were short-wheelbase convertibles like this one. In other words, some people have been waiting a long, long time for one of these to hit the open market. And you can expect they’re bringing a treasure chest of funds along for the bidding process.</p>

<p>For those who want to get beyond the curvaceous lines of this French beauty, which are quite captivating, housing under the long hood is a 4.5-liter OHV inline-six engine with three Zenith Stromberg carbs. By today’s standards the 190-horsepower peak output is laughable, but back in post-war Europe that was quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>What really adds to the compelling nature of this historically-significant classic car is the claim it’s in completely unrestored condition. Considering its age and how many Talbot-Lagos have been through at least a degree or restoration at some point, that’s remarkable. For that and the other compelling factors around this vehicle, Bonhams is estimating the top bid will hover near $2 million.</p>
