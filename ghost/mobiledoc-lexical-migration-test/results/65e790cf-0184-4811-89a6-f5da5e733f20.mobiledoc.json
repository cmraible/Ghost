Yes, this is a polarizing vehicle, but the story is this was the owner’s first car and he obviously fell in love with the thing. That’s no uncommon and a lot of gearheads start by tinkering around with their first ride, but they eventually cut their losses and upgrade to something better later."

After all, he swapped out the automatic transmission and installed a Tremec T56 Magnum to make it more performance-oriented. He’s also put on coilovers, done serious work on the interior, installed a performance cam, and made quite a few other tweaks. Even with all those modifications, this is still a land yacht."
