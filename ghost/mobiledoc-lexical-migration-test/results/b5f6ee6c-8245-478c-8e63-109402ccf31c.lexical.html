<hr>
<p>This high-performance 2000 Chevrolet Corvette is a track-proven beast as it was used by RideTech to test its C5 suspension parts. This powerful C5 also has plenty of go-fast goodies along with a Lingenfelter mill.

<p>This sinister C5 is clad in silver and features Lingenfelter and RideTech decals that offer a hint of what this Corvette is all about in regards to performance and suspension. Even more, the car is equipped with custom front and rear spoilers, and it has a set of 18-inch Forgeline GA3R 3-piece wheels that further add to its exterior aesthetic. </p>
<p>Now on to the performance aspect of this Corvette. Powering this beast is a Lingenfelter 417-cubic-inch LS3 V8 engine equipped with CNC ported and polished heads with an 11.5:1 compression. Shifting power to the rear wheels is provided by a T-56 six-speed manual transmission. Accompanying that V8 in rumble and performance is a Magnaflow stainless steel exhaust. This C5 'Vette puts out a healthy 605-horsepower. Big Wilwood power disc brakes all around bring all that power to a halt, and power steering makes maneuvering that road course a breeze. Speaking of this being one of RideTech's test cars for suspension parts, this one is equipped with TQ triple-adjust able coil overs, Delrin control arm bushings throughout, and front and rear sway bars.</p>
<p>Open the doors to a beautiful interior that still has all the Even more, Kirkey racing seats have been bolted in to replace the stock C5 seats and come complete with RideTech 4-point harnesses. This performance Corvette still retains air conditioning to keep the cabin nice and comfortable.</p>
