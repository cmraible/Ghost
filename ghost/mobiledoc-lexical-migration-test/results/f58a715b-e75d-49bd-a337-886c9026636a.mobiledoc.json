The body painted Rebel Grey, it’s a refreshing break from all the black paint jobs used when “murdering out” restomods and other vehicles. It also pairs exceptionally well with the matte black American Racing 10-spoke wheels with low profile tires mounted and almost no wheel gap showing. Instead of getting rid of all the chrome, a fair amount of the shiny trim is still left, keeping things from getting too dark."

There’s a nice bench seat for all that nostalgia you crave, plus the owner wanted this to be a car he could use to take the whole family on weekend cruises. Vintage Air helps keep everyone nice and cool, but without ruining the overall aesthetic. To that same end, a new sound system was installed so that it’s hidden from view. Of course, the digital gauge cluster is a far departure from what was originally in the car, yet it looks excellent in this restomod monster."
