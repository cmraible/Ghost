<p>We're not huge fans of crossovers here on Motorious. We long for the days when <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">station wagons</a> ruled the streets as the family car of choice for Americans from coast to coast.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1988 Chevrolet Caprice station wagon</a> has everything we love about old station wagons: a long, square body, giant chrome bumpers, a V8 under the hood, and an entire sequoia's worth of fake wood down the side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This station wagon</a> has had just two owners since new. The current owner bought it from the original owner back in 1995, and now they're ready to let it go.</p>

<p>The Caprice currently lives in <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Alameda, California</a>, and has covered just 58,000 miles since new. The combination of low miles, two owners, and a sympathetic climate has preserved this car in nearly new condition.</p>
<p>There are a few small blemishes here and there. The interior trim in the cargo area has a few scuffs, but nothing out of the ordinary. Maroon GM interiors of this era have a tendency to bleach into a horrifying shade of purple after years of UV exposure. Thankfully, that fate has not befallen <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Caprice</a>. We can safely assume this wagon has been garage-kept for most of its life.</p>

<p>Another common issue with midsize and full-size GMs of this era are cracked or missing bumper fillers. All are present, but one is cracked, <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">per the photos</a>. Again, these are small issues on an otherwise wonderful car.</p>
<p>It's currently being auctioned off by <a href="https://www.thedrivenexchange.com/vehicles/1988-chevrolet-caprice-estate/#?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The Driven Exchange</a>, and it seems at the moment like it will go for a great price. If you want to add this classic piece of Americana to your garage, don't hesitate to bid early and often.</p>
