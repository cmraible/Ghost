          "North Las Vegas Police posted about the incidents on Twitter. Both traffic stops happened on the night of July 15. The first time around, the guy was pulled over for doing 73 mph in a 35 mph zone. Just moments after being issued a reckless driving citation for more than doubling the speed limit, he was pulled over going 106 mph in a 35 mph zone."

If they hadn’t we bet there would’ve been a third traffic stop if not a horrendous crash. We’ve seen too many fatal collisions because someone decided to blast through an intersection at speeds which would be scary even on a highway."
