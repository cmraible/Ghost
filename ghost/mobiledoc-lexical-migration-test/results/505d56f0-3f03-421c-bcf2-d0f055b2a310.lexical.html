<p>President Joe Biden’s top White House staffers previously consulted for ride-hailing company Lyft, an Israeli facial recognition firm, and billionaires’ philanthropic foundations, according to new financial disclosure forms obtained by <em>The Daily Poster</em>.</p>
<p>While Biden’s cabinet officials have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-revolving-door/">already detailed</a> their extensive corporate consulting work and paid speaking gigs, the Biden administration is just now starting to release the financial disclosure forms filed by senior White House staff, launching a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/">webpage</a> on Friday where people can request the filings. The new disclosures provide more detail about links between top administration officials and corporations lobbying the Biden administration.</p>
<p>White House deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon, a deputy campaign manager for President Barack Obama in 2012, listed more than a dozen clients she worked for at the communications consulting firm Precision Strategies, including Lyft and General Electric.</p>
<p>Lyft <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/california-uber-lyft-prop-22.html">helped bankroll</a> a successful ballot measure campaign in California last year allowing the company to continue classifying its drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees. Lyft and other gig economy companies are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/27/uber-doordash-vs-gig-workers.html">hoping to export</a> the policy nationwide.</p>
<p>O'Malley Dillon also consulted for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s philanthropic organization, known as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and for Gates Ventures, the private office of billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Her other clients included Arkansans for a Fair Wage, a committee that backed a 2018 ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage in Arkansas to $11, and the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who served as a White House communications director under Obama, wrote that she served as a consultant for Lyft, too. She also disclosed handling crisis communications for AnyVision, a facial recognition firm whose technology has reportedly been used by Israel to surveil Palestinians in the West Bank, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/why-did-microsoft-fund-israeli-firm-surveils-west-bank-palestinians-n1072116">NBC News</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft, which had invested in AnyVision, hired former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at the law firm Covington & Burling to conduct an independent investigation into the reports. While their <a href="https://www.anyvision.co/admin/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covington-Findings-AnyVision-Audit-March-27-2020.pdf">audit</a> concluded that “AnyVision’s technology has not previously and does not currently power a mass surveillance program in the West Bank that has been alleged in media reports,” Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197577/microsoft-facial-recognition-investing-divest-anyvision-controversy">said it would sell its stakes</a> in AnyVision and other facial recognition companies.</p>
<p>Psaki is one of several Biden administration hires who worked at WestExec Advisors, a corporate consultancy co-founded by Biden’s Secretary of State, Tony Blinken. She did not specifically name her clients at the firm.</p>
<p>She separately disclosed consulting for Jeff Anderson and Associates, a law firm that seeks justice for children who suffer sexual abuse, and the Zero Abuse Project, a charitable organization founded by Jeff Anderson whose mission is to protect children from abuse and sexual assault.</p>
<p>White House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, a longtime D.C. deficit hawk and former Bill Clinton aide, disclosed providing policy consulting services to the Walton Family Foundation, the charitable arm of the billionaire family that founded Walmart.</p>
<p>Reed also consulted for Manhattan West LLC. <em>The New York Post</em> reported in 2011 that billionaire Mike Bloomberg’s “longtime accountant set up Manhattan West LLC to pay some city employees over $100,000 each to work for his charity” when he was the mayor of New York. Reed reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-2020.html">advised</a> Bloomberg on a potential presidential campaign in early 2019, before joining Biden’s 2020 campaign.</p>
<p>White House counselor Steve Ricchetti reported being paid $280,000 by his eponymous firm, Ricchetti Consulting Group. While Ricchetti did not list any clients, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/us/politics/biden-lobbyist-ties.html">reported last year</a> that he had been working for telecom giant AT&T.</p>
<p>Ricchetti’s brother, Jeff, is a lobbyist and has brought in several new clients since Biden’s victory, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/26/jeff-ricchetti-to-lobby-for-amazon-as-brother-becomes-joe-bidens-counselor.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e9dfb6c8-dfea-4345-9097-9cdaa235afb8/print/">General Motors</a>, and <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/keystone-pipeline-co-taps-lobbyist-brother-of-biden-adviser-1/">TC Energy</a>, the company behind the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which Biden blocked on his first day in office.</p>
