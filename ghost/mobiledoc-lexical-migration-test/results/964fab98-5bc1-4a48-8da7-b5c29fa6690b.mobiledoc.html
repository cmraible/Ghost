<p>Neither Brumos <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a> nor Brumos Racing exist today, but the legacy of both the dealership and race team will live on in Jacksonville, Florida thanks to the all-new <a href="https://thebrumoscollection.com/">The Brumos Collection</a>. The museum has finally announced that it will officially open on Thursday, January 23rd, which just so happens to be days before the 2020 Rolex 24 at Daytona â€“ a race very familiar with the Brumos livery!</p>

<p>Before The Brumos Collection opens in Southeast Jacksonville, all of the cars owned and raced by Brumos were housed in a warehouse/race shop/restoration shop across the street from the <a href="https://www.porschejacksonville.com/">Porsche showroom</a>, and even then, the collection could only be seen by private, invite-only tours. That will all change with this 35,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art museum that will be open to the public. From the outside, The Brumos Collection building is designed to pay homage to the look of the former Ford Model T plant located in downtown Jacksonville, while the inside will offer everything from a 22-seat movie theater to a an archive room to research automotive and racing history. More than just a museum, though, this facility will have a fully functional engine room, machine shop and dyno for vehicle repairs and restorations.</p>
<p>In terms of cars, the collection will have a wide variety of vehicles ranging from a 1910 Peugeot to a 2012 Porsche 911 Brumos Commemorative Edition. There will also be plenty of racecars on display like the 1967 Porsche 910, 1972 Porsche 917-10, 1986 Porsche 962 and the 1992 Ford Thunderbird racecar driven by NASCAR legend Mark Martin. There will even be a 1959 Porsche tractor!</p>

<p>Details such as cost, hours and a physical address have yet to be announced, but for fans of Porsches, endurance racing and just about anything that is cool and car related, The Brumos Collection will provide an excellent destination.</p>
<p>It's great to see the Brumos name back in action again!</p>
