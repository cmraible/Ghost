<p>After seeing the new 993-generation <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0221/open-roads--february/lots/c0001-1995-porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet/1039215#/utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0221">Cabriolet</a> at the 1993 Geneva Motor Show, Fritz Haberl, owner of MAHAG, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0221/open-roads--february/lots/c0001-1995-porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet/1039215#/utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0221">approached Porsche</a> with the idea of a limited-edition model. This resulted in Porsche agreeing to make 10 Turbo <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ultra-rare-ruf-btr-iii-cabriolet-is-ready-to-be-part-of-your-air-cooled-dreams/">Cabriolet</a> examples, specially built for the Porsche dealer in Munich, Germany.</p>

<p>Porsche started with the new <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0221/open-roads--february/lots/c0001-1995-porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet/1039215#/utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0221">993-generation 911 chassis</a> which featured a new multi-link rear setup. This new rear setup allowed the 993 chassis to remain stable under the larger amounts of power made by the outgoing 964-generation 911 Turbo’s engine and drivetrain. Modifying the body, Porsche then widened its rear wheel arches to Turbo specification and fitted it with a rear spoiler from the 964 Turbo S. In all, Porsche only made 14 examples of this highly collectable and little known <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0221/open-roads--february/lots/c0001-1995-porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet/1039215#/utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0221">993 Turbo Cabriolet</a>.</p>

This car is a well-kept example that deviates from it black on black theme only for a burgundy soft top. The interior shows minimal wear and features carbon fiber accents throughout.</p>

<p>The M64/50 3.6-litre flat six-cylinder engine with a single turbocharger has been fitted with a special gearbox, which does not utilize a clutch pedal, that was sourced through RUF and installed by Porsche. It was imported to Switzerland, where it currently resides with less than 20,000 miles on the clock, by its third owner. Accompanying the car is the original service manual and a guarantee certificate that verifies the car's claimed history. Not many of these cars were made and there is no telling how many of them have survived in this kind of condition. If you are a <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0221/open-roads--february/lots/c0001-1995-porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet/1039215#/utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0221">Porsche enthusiast</a>, then you do not want to miss out on this incredible opportunity.</p>
