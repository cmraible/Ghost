That’s especially true of one like this which has been the subject of a new paint and interior, which really dresses up the truck. Classic Air AC has been installed so you’re not sweating it out in the summertime. Upgraded tires give it a more imposing stance and help with ground clearance as well as traction on trail surfaces."

That means the potential of your getting an amazing deal on the off-roader is a little higher. For some the fact it’s an Eddie Bauer model is a nice plus since it comes with the extra styling details like the stylized trees and rising sun insert on the front seatback cushions."
