Of course, as a new car, it provides wonderful features like a 7.0\" colored multimedia display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto."

Suddenly, I realized this felt so "

The end of an era perhaps â€”  The last chance to buy into a pure enthusiast car. It's not hybrid/electric, it's not automatic, it's not an SUV, it doesn't brake for you, or park for you. Even the driving style is not like new sports cars. The turbo lags and requires you to drive rev happy to compensate. You need to work for the full satisfaction this car has to offer. It is fun driving simple as that."

Other factors need to be considered, such as little precious passengers, cargo space, safety ratings, reliability, and even residual values. The Subaru WRX STI keeps checking off boxes. The car has matured into a new age where it all makes sense, even from a pricing perspective. STI base starts at $36,995.00. The test car had the optional Bronze Finished 19\" forged BBS aluminum alloy wheels, STI tuned suspension with Bilstein dampers, high-performance summer tires and Recaro front bucket seats. As tested, including destination and delivery, $43,959.00."
