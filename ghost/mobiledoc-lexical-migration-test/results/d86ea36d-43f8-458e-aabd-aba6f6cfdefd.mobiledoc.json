When that factory-built car failed to arrive in time, Yenko grabbed a hardtop convertible Corvette off his dealership's showroom, and he swapped out that car's factory L-71 427 V8 for a L-88 427 – this engine was factory underrated at 430 horsepower and actual real-world power figures put this engine at 560 horsepower. This engine is topped with a Holley 850 CFM four-barrel carb and backed by a Muncie M-22 four-speed manual."

The car then headed to Sebring wearing the No. 2, and it set a GT Class lap record before retiring due to mechanical failures. Yenko also won the 1968 SCCA Midwest Division road-racing title in this Corvette. Although it was invited to race at the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans, it was never able to participate due to a postponed race and the eventual Sunoco buyout of Sunray-DX, which ended this livery's strong 1968 racing season."
