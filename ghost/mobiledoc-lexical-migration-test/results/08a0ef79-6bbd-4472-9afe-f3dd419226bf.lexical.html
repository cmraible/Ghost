<hr>
<p>There's several good reasons why classic pickup trucks like <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Chevrolet Apache</a> have appreciated in value over the years. They're Americana distilled – hardworking, handsome, reliable, and instantly recognizable. </p>

<p>Because most lived hard lives as work trucks, <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">these old pickup trucks</a> tend to get used up and thrown away. As a result, finding a nice example of your favorite classic pickup can be challenge – and it'll usually cost you a pretty penny when you do.</p>

<p>True to their name, this dealership specializes in Corvettes. However, when they decide to offer a non-'Vette, you best believe it's <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the nicest of the nice</a>. This Apache is no different.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect, 100-point concours restoration, and that's just fine by us. Instead, it's been treated to <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">some tasteful upgrades</a> that improve and personalize the truck without destroying its original charm.</p>

<p>We like the polished wheels, <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">subtly lowered and raked stance</a>, and the dual exhausts exiting below the rear bumper. Under the hood, you'll find a mild 350 cubic inch small block backed up by a floor-shifted Muncie four-speed. Power is sent through a Positraction rear end.</p>
<p>If this 1959 Chevrolet Apache is exactly what you've been looking for, you can find it at <a href="https://www.corvettemikemidwest.com/vehicles/71/1959-chevrolet-apache-step-side-pick-up?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Corvette Mike Midwest</a> for $39,990. You certainly couldn't restore one to this standard for that kind of money, and there's nothing we would have done differently with this build.</p>
