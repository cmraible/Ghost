Outside, this '88 Defender is equipped with a heavy-duty bumper along with a KBX front grille and headlight surround. Even more, throw everything in the high-capacity long bed that has been sprayed with Rhino Bed Liner for protection. Even the undercarriage has been sprayed to keep everything protected and free of rust. For even more protection, a front skid plate was also installed. There's still plenty of life left in this '88 Defender with an actual mileage of 35,021 as stated on the title. Also, this epic truck is right-hand-drive."

The addition of off-road wheels and tires help when tackling the off-beaten path. "
