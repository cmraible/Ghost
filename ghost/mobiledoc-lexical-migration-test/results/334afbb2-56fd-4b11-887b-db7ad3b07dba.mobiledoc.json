In fact, in 1995, the 993 Carrera RS was a specially designed model for competition use. It boasts similar features to the typical Carrera, except with aerodynamic measures to make it lighter on the track. Compared to the regular RSR 3.8 model, this one is about 220 lbs lighter. This particular car is one of only 1,104 examples built, with a very extensive log of features, basically detailing how rare it is and why. It also sounds pretty fun to drive, if we might add."

The turbocharged technology-enabled 930 is much loved by all, not only because it looks good, but also because it’s a feat of engineering. It was born out of the 911, with the very big modification of a turbocharged flat-six engine, flared wheel arches for wider wheels, and a “whale tail” rear spoiler. This is one beautiful example. It’s one of only 677 Rest of World (ROW) market coupes finished in Paint-to-Sample. It had just less than 11,221km or 7,000 miles on its odometer when Gooding & Company catalogued it."

          "Here’s another tidbit of Porsche history. Max Hoffman, who worked for Porsche in the 50s, wanted to create a model to compete with other popular purpose-built cars at the time, like offerings from MG, Austin-Healey, and Triumph. Essentially, he was looking for something that was fast, without being too frou-frou. The Speedster was born, which ended up being one of the most beautiful models Porsche ever made, while also being incredible to drive. The T2 model, a.k.a. the kind offered here, is among  the best within the Speedster category. It has undergone a crazy-good restoration to enhance the car’s performance while retaining its factory-original appearance. It has a rare factory color and a powerful, upgraded engine. It’s a real stunner and a real Speedster all in one."

It was the last of 10 examples ever built, with a very extensive racing history in the 70s– it earned top 10 finishes at Sears Point and Pocono, as well as 3rd Place at the Daytona Finale. This model has a whole lot of swag. In 1978, this 934/5 was updated with 935 style-bodywork, before being stripped down right after. Finally, it was meticulously and completely restored to its proper 1977 specification, as well as the Desperado Racing Livery. It has been built and restored by true Porsche specialists, granting it the highest levels of historic competition, while also making it a rare and beautiful bird. Porsche lovers, there’s more where this came from. You can peruse the "
