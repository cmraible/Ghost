You can listen to Putsch’s story in the video since he tells it better than anyone, but once he did get the Lykan all buttoned up and took it out, people got pretty excited since they instantly recognized what it is. We’re hoping as things open back up, maybe in 2021, and we have events again this supercar will be making the rounds."
