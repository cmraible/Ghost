It’s an insulting, infuriating, and sometimes very expensive situation, even if you’re not in love with your vehicle. For that reason alone, we like to cover stories like this one where a teenager in Texas stole a Chevy Camaro, but he literally didn’t get away with it."

He might have been able to just drive nice and normal and the police would’ve moved on after running the plates. But nobody has accused car thieves of being smart in general. The guy made a run for it, ensuring the cops would give chase."

One thing a rear-wheel-drive performance car will do is expose your lack of driving skills in a hurry. After Chambers bolted in the Camaro, he hit a trailer being towed by a truck, then careened into an electrical box. Maybe it’s a good thing car thieves don’t really know how to drive."
