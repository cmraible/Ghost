<p>In February 1995, NASCAR officially waved the green flag in its SuperTruck Series, and 25 years later, this series – currently called the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series (GROTS) – continues to give NASCAR fans intense racing action. To celebrate the series' silver anniversary, the <a href="https://www.nascarhall.com/">NASCAR Hall Of Fame</a> has a special exhibit of trucks called "<a href="https://www.nascarhall.com/explore/exhibits/haulin-25-years-of-nascar-trucks">Haulin’: 25 Years of NASCAR Trucks</a>."</p>
<p>This limited-time exhibit runs through July, and it features eight iconic trucks that have been used over the years. These range from the Ford F-150 driven by 2019 champion, Matt Crafton, to the 1994 Chevrolet driven by P.J. Jones. As the Series' winningest driver, it's no surprise that Kyle Busch's 2010 Toyota Tundra is included in the mix, and the iconic no. 3 Chevrolet driven by Mike Skinner (wearing the same GM Goodwrench livery as Dale Earnhardt) is also on display.</p>
<p>After running as the SuperTruck Series in 1995, the name changed to Craftsman Truck Series from 1996 until 2008, and it was then called the Camping World Truck from 2009 until 2018. The current Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series naming took place for the 2019 season. In terms of driver development, the Truck Series has proved to be a feeder series for NASCAR teams, and four of the six rookies competing in the 2020 Cup Series have had success in the Truck Series.</p>
<p>Rather than following around the rest of the NASCAR teams, the Truck series has always driven on smaller tracks bringing the NASCAR action to smaller markets. One of the coolest moves of this sport was when NASCAR brought back dirt track racing by running the trucks at Ohio's Eldora Speedway, which is owned by Tony Stewart. The extensive use of short tracks has always brought added excitement to this series as well.</p>
