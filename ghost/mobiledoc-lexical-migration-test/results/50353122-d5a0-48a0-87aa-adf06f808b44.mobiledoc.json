Although it doesn't go as far as to make any vintage livery claims, combining the Rapid Blue paint job with the new orange racing stripes gives the Corvette a Gulf Racing livery appearance. Likewise, the blue stripes combined with the Arctic White paint job are a throwback to Briggs Cunningham's Le Mans-racing Corvettes from the '60s. Chevrolet also teased examples of how a black Corvette with look with red and yellow racing stripes."
