<p>Last month, nearly 40,000 corporate lawyers representing the American Bar Association’s (ABA) Business Law Section wrote a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AeK94yXI34nIrp4h8GYQ6TtzIIVWro5O/view?usp=sharing">comment</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department, expressing their concerns about the department’s proposal to implement the Corporate Transparency Act — a measure designed “to help prevent and combat money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud, and other illicit activity.”</p>
<p>The organization’s comment letter represents the latest action in its lengthy campaign to kill anti-money laundering rules — some of which could directly impact its members.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:<br></h3>
<p>Last month, an international group of nearly 40,000 corporate lawyers representing the American Bar Association’s (ABA) Business Law Section submitted a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AeK94yXI34nIrp4h8GYQ6TtzIIVWro5O/view?usp=sharing">comment</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department complaining about the department’s proposed regulations to implement the Corporate Transparency Act.</p>
<p>Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) released the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/08/2021-26548/beneficial-ownership-information-reporting-requirements">draft rules</a> in December to implement the law’s requirement for corporations to disclose to the feds “beneficial ownership and company applicant information… to help prevent and combat money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud, and other illicit activity.”</p>
<p>The ABA’s comment letter outlines concerns regarding heightened risk of data breaches, competing privacy requirements, liability among senior officers for reporting violations, and more.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be the first time the Bar has had something to say about federal anti-money laundering policy. Back in 2019, the membership group <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/search/?registrant=&registrant_country=&registrant_ppb_country=&client=American+Bar+Association&client_state=&client_country=&client_ppb_country=&lobbyist=&lobbyist_covered_position=&lobbyist_conviction_disclosure=&lobbyist_conviction_date_range_from=&lobbyist_conviction_date_range_to=&report_period=&report_year=2019&report_dt_posted_from=&report_dt_posted_to=&report_amount_reported_min=&report_amount_reported_max=&report_filing_uuid=&report_issue_area_description=Corporate+transparency+act&affiliated_organization=&affiliated_organization_country=&foreign_entity=&foreign_entity_country=&foreign_entity_ppb_country=&foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_min=&foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_max=&search=search#js_searchFormTitle">lobbied</a> on the bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act when it was being debated in Congress and released a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/government_affairs_office/final-letter-to-house-opposing-2513.pdf?logActivity=true">letter</a><a href="https://bpi.com/american-bar-association-opposes-anti-money-laundering-efforts-objection/">opposing</a> the legislation.</p>
<p>Despite the bill earning the support of <a href="https://maloney.house.gov/sites/maloney.house.gov/files/108%20NGOs.pdf">over 100</a> diverse organizations for its relatively light-touch approach to crack down on anonymous shell companies, the ABA disagreed, citing <a href="https://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2019/01/15/will-2019-be-the-year-the-us-finally-passes-anonymous-company-reform-not-if-the-aba-gets-its-way/">misleading</a> claims about the bill’s “burdensome, costly, and unworkable new regulatory burdens” for small businesses and privacy concerns, and ultimately arguing that existing FinCEN and IRS rules are sufficient “to fight money laundering and terrorist financing.”</p>
<p>While the ABA was purportedly trying to protect the small business community, as <em>Quartz</em><a href="https://qz.com/1646365/the-american-bar-association-is-fighting-congresss-efforts-to-tackle-money-laundering/">reported</a> in July of 2019, “there are influential sections of the legal world who make a lot of money from setting up anonymous companies… Passing the bill would be a serious dent in America’s tax haven status, and lose a lot of lawyers a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether the legal industry gets its way when the final Treasury Department rules are published later this year.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-flashback">TODAY’S FLASHBACK:</h3>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently attributed her return to politics to her love of the TV drama <em>The West Wing</em> and especially actor Rob Lowe’s character Sam Seaborn, deputy communications director in the fictional version of the White House.</p>
<p>“That character was so inspiring because that idealism that Sam Seaborn had, that you embodied for many years, is kind of what the best of Washington is,” Psaki <a href="https://people.com/politics/press-secretary-jen-psaki-tells-rob-lowe-west-wing-character-inspired-return-white-house/">said</a> on Lowe’s podcast, <em>Literally! With Rob Lowe</em>.</p>
<p>For readers who never shared Psaki’s urge to binge-watch <em>The West Wing</em>, this is the same Sam Seaborn who, in the show’s second season, used a comically elitist, ultra-conservative argument to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nzeJrXFttg">urge</a> the Congressional Progressive Caucus to stop demanding the wealthy pay more in taxes, citing his experience as a high-paid lawyer.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/gift_subscription#/" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Give A Gift Subscription</a></div>
<p>“Henry, last fall, every time your boss got on the stump and said, ‘It’s time for the rich to pay their fair share,’ I hid under a couch and changed my name,” Seaborn said in the episode. “I left Gage Whitney making $400,000 a year, which means I paid 27 times the national average in income tax. I paid my fair share, and the fair share of 26 other people. And I’m happy to, ’cause that’s the only way it’s gonna work. And it’s in my best interest that everybody be able to go to schools and drive on roads. But I don’t get 27 votes on Election Day. The fire department doesn’t come to my house 27 times faster and the water doesn’t come out of my faucet 27 times hotter. The top one percent of wage earners in this country pay for 22 percent of this country. Let’s not call them names while they’re doing it, is all I’m saying.”</p>
<p>Truly inspiring stuff.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<p><strong>PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTS IN BELTWAY CORRUPTION: </strong>The private equity firm Coral Tree Partners just <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2022/03/01/what-k-street-is-watching-for-from-biden-tonight-00012950">bought a stake</a> in Subject Matter, the D.C. lobbying firm founded by former top Democratic congressional aide Steve Elmendorf. Subject Matter’s clients include corporate health care giants like Pfizer and UnitedHealth Group, Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and Blackstone Group, and the global oil and gas company BP. Late last year, the Colorado Fire & Police Pension Association <a href="https://www.pionline.com/searches-and-hires/colorado-fire-police-slates-100-million-3-alts-funds">committed</a> $25 million to Coral Tree Partners.</p>
<p><strong>ABORTION RIGHTS’ BILL FAILS IN SENATE: </strong>One day before the start of Women’s History Month, the U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/28/22946299/womens-health-protection-act-senate-vote-abortion-rights">voted to block</a> the Women’s Health Protection Act — legislation to codify in federal law the right to an abortion ahead of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/01/21/1074605184/abortion-roe-v-wade-supreme-court">likely Supreme Court action</a> to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. The final count was 46-48, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin the only Democrat to vote no. Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) also opposed the bill, despite long <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/collins-murkowski-abortion-history-cbfc70d977ac/">touting themselves</a> as supporters of abortion rights. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) <a href="https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-statement-on-the-womens-health-protection-act">voted in favor</a> of allowing debate on the bill — a surprise given his <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pa-s-casey-votes-for-anti-abortion-bills-rejected-by-the-u-s-senate/">past support</a> for anti-abortion measures. The vote occurred around the 6-month anniversary of passage of a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/10/texas-abortion-law-ban-enforcement/">controversial Texas law</a> that bans abortions after six weeks of pregancy and effectively deputizes private citizens to enforce the law.</p>
<p><strong>WEALTHY NATIONS DOWNPLAY CLIMATE CRISIS AT UN TALKS:</strong> The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) discussions extended into the weekend as the U.S., Germany, France, and other wealthy nations <a href="https://twitter.com/KateAronoff/status/1498314895485513734">tried to wordsmith</a> the IPCC’s latest report to tone down the climate crisis. <em>Climate Home News</em><a href="https://climatechangenews.com/2022/02/28/revealed-how-rich-and-at-risk-nations-fought-over-science-of-climate-impacts/">reported</a> instances of the U.S. proposing alternative language to deflect responsibility from the fossil fuel industry, including lobbying for references to the merits of nature-based solutions like tree-planting instead. “The Biden administration is not only shutting their eyes to the reality of the climate crisis — they’re trying to blindfold the rest of the world too,” <a href="https://climatechangenews.com/2022/02/28/revealed-how-rich-and-at-risk-nations-fought-over-science-of-climate-impacts/">said</a> Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International. Despite developed countries’ tone-policing efforts, the final report captured the gravity of the crisis: “a sicker, hungrier, poorer, gloomier and way more dangerous” world in the next two decades, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-europe-united-nations-weather-8d5e277660f7125ffdab7a833d9856a3"><em>Associated Press</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>EPIPEN MANUFACTURER AGREES TO HEFTY SETTLEMENT: </strong>Earlier this week, the drugmaker Viatris Inc. — formerly Mylan — announced its agreement to pay a proposed $264 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit “alleging it engaged in a scheme to delay generic competition to its EpiPen allergy treatment,” according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/viatris-settle-epipen-antitrust-litigation-264-million-2022-02-28/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. The litigation began in 2016 after Mylan drastically raised the EpiPen’s list price, and it accused Mylan and Pfizer — the medicine’s manufacturers — of trying to “maintain a monopoly over the market for the devices.” As <em>The Intercept</em> reported in September, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s daughter and former Mylan chief executive, Heather Bresch, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/07/joe-manchin-epipen-price-heather-bresch/">worked directly</a> with the head of Pfizer to artificially inflate EpiPen prices.</p>
<p><strong>NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS APPOINTS ANTI-GAY PASTORS:</strong> Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/03/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-anti-lgbt-gay-marriage-pastors-appointments/">just appointed</a> Fernando Cabrera, Gilford Monrose, and Erick Salgado — three pastors with a record of homophobia — to work in his administration. The move incensed LGBTQ advocates, who <a href="https://abc7ny.com/eric-adams-protest-controversy-appointments/11596543/">took to city hall</a> on Thursday to protest. “Choosing socially conservative pastors is a signal, to religious working-class communities at least, that Adams is listening,” <em>Jacobin</em> wrote. “The activists who protested outside of city hall probably didn’t vote for Adams. But the people showing up at Cabrera and Salgado’s churches maybe did.”</p>
