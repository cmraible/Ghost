<p>Small and nimble, the Dart has been a good option for people who want a classic Dodge, but like something which will hug the turns in the road. This <a href="https://premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/2895/1971-dodge-dart-swinger-hardtop?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 Dodge Dart Swinger</a> is in particularly good condition, with almost all of its original equipment intact. According to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Premier+Auction+Group">Premier Auction Group</a>, which is offering this car to the public, there are only 27,000 actual miles on this ride, which explains its amazing condition.</p>

<p>Under the hood is a 225 Slant 6-cylinder engine that’s numbers-matching. Mated to that is an automatic transmission, also original to the car. Everything works properly, so you can grab this car and hit the road immediately.</p>
<p>Good looks come naturally, thanks to a Dark Gold over Ember Gold color scheme. The paint looks great and the Dark Gold vinyl top isn’t splitting, cracking, or fading, which is a huge plus for a car this age. All the body panels are straight and don’t have obvious damage, showing careful use over the past 49 years. Just as amazing is the factory interior, which doesn’t show any major signs of wear. In fact, the front and rear seats almost look as if nobody has sat in them.</p>
<p>The factory glass is still installed and was tinted by Dodge, so it looks great and helps keep you cool. Included as well, factory air conditioning works great. If you want to listen to some tunes, an upgraded, modern AM/FM radio with Bluetooth gives you plenty of options. As an additional bonus, the original owner’s manual and chassis service manual are included with the car.</p>
<p>It was in 1960 the Dodge Dart originally launched. The small car was created as an entry-level model for price-conscious shoppers. A second generation was launched for 1967 and lasted until 1976. While Dodge used the Dart nameplate not too long ago, this is the classic everyone remembers and loves.</p>
