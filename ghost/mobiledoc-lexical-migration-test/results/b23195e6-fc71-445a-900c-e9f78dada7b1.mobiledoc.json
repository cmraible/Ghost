We’re big fans of the SS and think it should be included in the muscle car classification, believing anyone who’s driven one would quickly become a believer as well. The model had a confusing name, which combined with ho-hum looks probably helped guarantee the short production run. Outside of enthusiast circles it’s not well-known at all, so the full-size sedan is definitely a sleeper."

In fact, this is the same engine used in the Camaro ZL1. It makes the full-size sedan that much more of a sleeper since it doesn’t look fast but it secretly is. But, can it take on the AMG GLE 63 S and win?"

However, housed under those flowing curves is a 4.0-liter biturbo V8 pushing 603-hp and 627 lb.-ft. of torque. The SUV also comes with all-wheel drive, which can really help with a clean launch."
