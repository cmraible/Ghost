While you might be at least partially aware of Corvette engines used in other road-going vehicles not built by GM like the 1958 Scarab, 1967 Bizzarrini Strada, 1966 Excalibur, 1969 Mangusta, and 1977 Avanti II. The list of production cars is much longer than that, but it gives you an idea of just how far the small block V8’s influence has stretched over the years."
