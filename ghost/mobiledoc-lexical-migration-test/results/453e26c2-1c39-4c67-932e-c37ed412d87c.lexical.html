<p>Pete Hines of Bethesda was recently asked about the future of Nintendo Switch support and whether the console will see some Fallout ports. Here’s what he had to say…</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Truthfully, I don’t know. We have talked about that and we have thought about that, but as you just saw from Bethesda Game Studios, they are super busy. id’s got four different properties rolling right now – Quake Champions is still in Early Access, but Rage 2 and the work that they’re doing for that, and then you know, a ton of folks working on Doom Eternal. If we had stuff that we thought was a good fit for Switch and we thought there was demand, we’d do it, but we’re also looking for future things and what we’re doing going forward that might be a good fit. I think it’s an awesome console. I brought mine with me. So it’s something we want to obviously continue to support with whatever we’re making that will run and run well on the Switch.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it doesn’t sound too promising, but Bethesda are always keeping the Switch in mind and thinking about their fans. We could also see a few announcements in the next upcoming Direct, whenever that may be.</p>
