Thanks to a fiberglass body kit, it has the appearance of a cartoon version of the Ferrari Enzo, a car most of us could never afford but definitely have admired. Plus, there are scissor doors for added dramatic flair. By owning this Pontiac, you get closer than you probably ever will to realizing some of your wildest dreams."

That could be because you along with so many others saw it on the Car Bros YouTube channel or at the Concours d’Lemons where it gloriously won a Worst in Show award. It’s also possible you caught this Fierri when it was featured on Jay Leno’s Garage. It was also featured during the 2019 Quail Motorsports Gathering. Forgetting a masterpiece like this is pretty much impossible."
