<p>If you move fast, there are a few hours left to bid on a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-chevrolet-camaro/">1968 Chevrolet Camaro RS Convertible</a> posted on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ebay-find-1962-dodge-dart/">eBay</a>. Before you start panicking looking for the link, slow down and look at the pictures while reading on, because this most definitely is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-cars-abandoned-projects/">project car</a>, so you’d be bidding on a huge commitment. Not everyone will agree it’s worth the current top bid of $6,100 (which could be much higher by the time you read this).</p>

<p>For a lot of people, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1968-camaro-nascar-v8/">’68 Camaro is one good-looking car</a>. Some believe it’s best enjoyed topless. However, as you can clearly see from the photos, this once-white convertible is now <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rusty-car-collection-sale/">mostly rusty</a>, although there’s still some white clinging to the body, providing that alluring cow print effect everyone just loves.</p>

<p>The seller on eBay claims this ’68 Camaro Convertible is all-original. Per the listing, it’s been with that person for 5 years and we’re guessing they haven’t lifted a finger on fixing up anything. That’s a wild stab and we could be completely wrong, but we have a hunch here.</p>

<p>That’s right, this RS comes with the 6-cylinder engine, which is advertised as having 78,000 miles on it. There’s also an automatic transmission with console shifter, so for all you who never learned to drive standard well, this one’s for you.</p>

<p>Smartly, the seller is really trying to position this Camaro as a true collectible. Supposedly, there were only 3,513 1968 Chevy Camaro RS Convertibles with the 6-cylinder engine made and we can’t possibly imagine why that would be. Maybe this car is perfect for you or maybe that low production number which is below 4,000 units just sounds magical.</p>

<p>Not only will you need to do a complete restoration on this car, the title has been lost. Sound like a great deal or is this one to pass on? You decide.</p>
