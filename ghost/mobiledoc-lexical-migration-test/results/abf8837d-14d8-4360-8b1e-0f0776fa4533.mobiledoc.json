A sprint to 62-mph could be accomplished in exactly 3.1-seconds and the car was capable of beating its predecessor around the Fiorano test circuit by a full second. Styling was improved as well with sharpened body lines and a sportier overall look that helped to increase downforce. On top of having an already long list of improvements, "
