But now we know that Camaros are the cars prone to driving into flower shops, thanks to an incident in Whittier, California back on January 10."

While that certainly is hilarious, the reality is this sounds like it might have been the outcome of some good ol’ fashioned street racing."

The Camaro hit a car waiting at a red light, then power pole (see, they don’t just attract Mustangs) and finally crashed into the flower shop. You can see in some of the shots the pole is splintered, so it took quite the hit. And yes, you could make a joke about how portly the Camaro has become."

We’re hoping it was able to open for business and such, considering so many small establishments have been struggling lately."

And they might not, until one night they do. That’s how it works, you can street race for years and never hit another car, building, etc. and then in a split second that changes. Take it to the track, everyone."
