It is said to have been purchased through Porsche’s Tourist Delivery Program, and toured around Europe only to be brought to California and sold to its second owner. For those not aware of Porsche’s Tourist Delivery Program, that is where the buyer gets to go pick the car up directly from Porsche while on vacation in Europe. While it does seem like an intriguing offer, the second owner appears to be the one that actually fell in love with the car. The car spent the next 22 years, and only 33,000 miles being pampered and upgraded before being sold again."
