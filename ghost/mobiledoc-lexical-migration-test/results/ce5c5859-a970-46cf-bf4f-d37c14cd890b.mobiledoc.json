There was sustained, energetic bidding throughout both sale sessions, from start to finish, beginning with the sale of the 1984 Tiga SC84 Sports 2000, generously offered by John and Aimee Oates to benefit the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance Foundation. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer drove the race car onto the auction block following an introduction from Concours Founder and Chairman, Bill Warner. The Tiga sold for $50,400, with all proceeds benefiting the Foundation’s support of Spina Bifida of Jacksonville."

          "Top sales of the auction demonstrate strong interest in high-quality, new-to-the-market cars across all categories, led by a low-mileage 2003 Ferrari Enzo offered from 15 years of meticulous ownership in the Lingenfelter Collection, which sold for a final $2,782,500. The Enzo is followed by the exceedingly rare, beautifully restored 1938 Bugatti Type 57 Cabriolet, the only example in the three-seater Aravis style body configurationby D’Ieteren. The Bugatti saw immediate interest from international bidders, bringing a final $1,655,000. The top three is completed by a 1963 Ferrari 250 GT/L Berlinetta Lusso, an attractive, beautifully restored and award-winning example, which sold for $1,600,000."

We saw high energy in the auction room and great response to our auctioneer, Mike Shackelton,  translating to strong prices for our most valuable  offerings as well as for some truly unique lots. We look forward to  continuing the momentum at our Palm Beach sale in a couple of weeks.”"
