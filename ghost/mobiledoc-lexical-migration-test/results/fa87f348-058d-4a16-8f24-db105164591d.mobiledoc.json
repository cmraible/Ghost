A simple search of &#8220;<a title=\"Deleted Mailbox Twitter Search\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=deleted%20mailbox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleted mailbox</a>&#8221; right now appears to bring up a handful of tweets from people who have deleted the app over the wait time. Will this trend continue? We&#8217;ll keep an eye on it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Deleted @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mailbox\">mailbox</a>. Someone tell me when it’s an app that is actually useable and doesn’t make you wait in a stupid virtual line.</p>\n<p>— Nate Chiger (@natechiger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natechiger/status/299960969457725440\">February 8, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One thing I noticed while searching Twitter was people wondering if people who have deleted the app still have their spot in line reserved? That&#8217;s a good question. We&#8217;ve reached out to Mailbox and will let you know when/if we hear back about that.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we were lucky enough to get into Mailbox the other day and have a <a title=\"Mailbox Review\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/2013/02/12/mailbox-review/\">full review of the app</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> We&#8217;ve heard back from Mailbox, and they have told <em>BestTechie</em> that, &#8220;as long as iCloud is enabled, they won&#8217;t lose their place in line if they delete the app.&#8221; So there&#8217;s the answer to that, if you use iCloud and delete the app, you still reserve your spot in line which means others will not be moved up.</p>\n"
