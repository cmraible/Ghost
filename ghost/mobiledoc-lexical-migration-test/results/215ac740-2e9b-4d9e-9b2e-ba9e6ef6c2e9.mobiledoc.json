          "Being raised by affluent, famous people might sound like a dream come true, but the reality is probably a lot different. We don’t really know, but can imagine how it might warp one’s sense of what’s normal and expected in life. That might be partly what’s behind the shocking news that Cyndi Lauper’s 24-year-old son Declyn being arrested behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz police in New York City say was stolen."

It was illegally double-parked, so officers ran the plates and claim those on the vehicle belonged to something else. That’s when they started asking questions, ran the VIN, and got a hit for a stolen car report from 2020."

          "Their son has launched a rap career and goes by Dex Lauper. He shared a garbled video of his arrest on Instagram with his 2 million followers, but later decided to take that post down. He later posted an expletive-filled message on his stories directed at TMZ, so it’s obvious the guy isn’t loving the press attention. He later posted a fairly explicit video of him and other rappers partying on a boat with models, saying “No time for TMZ I just want some Privacy (sic) I just want some time for Me (sic)!” It seemed like a far cry from girls just wanting to have fun and all that."
