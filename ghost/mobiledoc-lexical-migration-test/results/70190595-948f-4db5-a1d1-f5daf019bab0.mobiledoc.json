This incredible video shows that passion for exploration perfectly with a twist that will likely be well received in the offroading community. This guy took a pretty much stock Bronco, which he bought for $1500, to the middle of practically nowhere to test the offroading skills of this classic OJ escape vehicle. Of course, this may look like a bucket of rust to ordinary people, but then again, we are not normal. This incredible Sports Utility Vehicle now has the perfect opportunity to showcase its ability to do things that a brand new model wouldn't dare. "

          "Under the hood of this '90s, Bronco beast is a big V8 engine that perfectly compliments the 32\" tires and lifts kit with plenty of torque and horsepower. The main goal of offroading is not only to prove that the vehicle can go anywhere; instead, it is also to explore places that no one has gone before. It seems safe to say that this truck has something to prove that no other vehicle could match in such a \"close to stock form\" as this. Rock climbing, mud crawling, and fitting into tight spaces are surprisingly easy for the Bronco as it slowly crawls up a slippery and very steep trail with minimal issues."

          "After significant obstacles like the hills and mud were conquered, it was time to head for the steepest rock climb in the land thus far. Everything from Razors to Chevy trucks has tried these twin hills with just a bit too much confidence. However, only a special few have made it to the top. These guys will try their hand at getting this Bronco past the obstacle, which the regulars seem to think is an impossible feat. But, of course, most of what this truck has done so far was considered impossible, so we'll have to see what happens in the second installment of the series."
