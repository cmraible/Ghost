<h3 id="its-definitely-one-of-the-more-tasteful-show-trucks-to-come-out-of-sema-recently">It's definitely one of the more tasteful show trucks to come out of SEMA recently.</h3>
<p>The annual SEMA Show is a great place to see the extremes that vehicles can be modified and tuned, but it's getting rare to see a tasteful, everyday vehicle emerge from the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center. That's just what we have here, though, with this mean-looking <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/168754/2011-gmc-sierra-sema-show-truck">2011 GMC Sierra</a> that is the latest addition to the Streetside Classics showroom in Phoenix, AZ, and it is ready to win awards at any car show.</p>

<p>The fine details are what really makes this Sierra show truck pop, and that starts with the custom pin striping done by Gary Jensen. Perhaps even better, the bed of this truck has an old-school look with dark wood and chrome strips, and it even has a little practicality with a hard tonneau cover and billet cargo divider – not that anyone would ever dare to put anything in the bed.</p>
<p>Although designed for work, this regular cab truck looks spectacular with its lowered stance and forged 22-inch Billet racing wheels.  The black paint job looks flawless, and it's perfectly complemented by the smoked headlights and taillights as well as the brushed billet handles on the doors and tailgate. Inside, this truck has low-back bucket seats with quilted leather on the seats and center console, and there are some eye-catching Plasti-dip accents inside the truck and under the hood with a really neat wood-like pattern.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the truck, the builder didn't go too crazy with the performance modifications, but you still get a cold air intake, dual exhaust and Superchip engine programmer. Being a legit show truck, this 2011 GMC Sierra has been babied its whole life, and it shows slightly more than 3,000 original miles on the odometer.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a turn-key truck that you could start showing tomorrow, then this 2011 GMC Sierra SEMA Show Truck is the way to go!</p>
