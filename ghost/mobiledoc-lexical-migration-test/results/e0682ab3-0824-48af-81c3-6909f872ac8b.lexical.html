<h3 id="although-these-are-amazing-cars-they-didnt-sell-at-amelia-island">Although these are amazing cars, they didn't sell at Amelia Island!</h3>
<p>The Amelia Island Auction is one of the most highly anticipated events of the year for both collectors, and the general automotive enthusiast. It is held at the Omni Amelia Island Plantation, which is a very pristine, classic Florida beachfront rector.</p>
<p>Held on Friday, the auction is the opener for the weekend that celebrates the automobile. During the auction, there are spirited bidders who get a chance at some of the most exclusive vehicles in the world. Some of these goes for extreme amounts, while other lucky bidders get to take home some bargains.</p>
<p>What’s really surprising is when a car many has been eyeing doesn’t actually sell! Like these cars from Friday.</p>

<p>It was a big fat “pass” on this beautifully presented Ferrari that had just barely 5,000 miles on the clock. Even with a 12-cylinder engine and five-speed manual, the <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/vehicle/1982-ferrari-512-bb/">lot 7</a> car failed to find a new home.</p>
<p><strong>1971 Mercedes-Benz 280 SE 3.5</strong></p>

<p>The convertible Merc has only been owned by two owners in its life, and up to Friday, it will remain that way. It’s well-preserved and carries a value of $275K to $350K, but just didn’t leave <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/vehicle/1971-mercedes-benz-280se-3-5-cabriolet/">lot 9</a> with a new owner.</p>

<p>This stunner that occupied <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/vehicle/1957-ac-ace-bristol-4/">lot 22</a> is a great example of the definitive sports car. It was raced in SCCA events, and probably won’t see much road time anytime soon since it’s going to remain up for sale.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/vehicle/1957-ac-ace-bristol-4/">lot 24</a> Porsche has seen a lot of action around the world, but one thing it won’t see is the inside of a new owner’s garage, at least not this time. Even though the bidding went pretty high, it wasn’t enough to take home this car that has an estimated value of over $1 million.</p>
<p><strong>1979 Porsche 935</strong></p>

<p>When lot 58 rolled around and didn’t sell, our jaws dropped! This is one of only seven of its kind, and has a valuation of up to $3 million, but the originally Otis Chandler owned Porsche isn’t exchanging hands at this time.</p>
