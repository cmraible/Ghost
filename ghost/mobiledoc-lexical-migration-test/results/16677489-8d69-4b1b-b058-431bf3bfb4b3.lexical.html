<p>Reality these days is an assault of traumatic news, and things are likely to get more tumultuous in the future. But that’s why it’s more important than ever to find your own version of self care. When done right, self care isn’t narcissistic self-absorption or sticking your head in the sand — it is an investment in mental resilience during an era when we most need it. The work of bettering the world is a marathon, not a sprint — and that’s why we have dedicated this edition of Weekend Reader to ways that we can pace ourselves, so we can all keep running that marathon.</p>
<p>All that in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><strong>Coping With COVID-19</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/12/1027198541/how-to-deal-with-renewed-covid-anxiety"><strong>How To Deal With Renewed COVID Anxiety</strong></a><strong></strong>(NPR) — <em>“The first step is acknowledging the trauma that we've experienced, the stacked stressors we've all been through over the last 17 months. That is real: It takes a toll on our bodies and minds. And once we allow ourselves to feel those complicated feelings, then we can unlock some coping strategies like making sure we exercise, prioritize sleep, connect with our loved ones and follow the facts. Make sure that you are looking to experts, including your trusted primary care provider, for nuanced advice to help marry broad public health advice with your unique situation. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for human behavior in a pandemic. So, we really need to drill down into what it is that gives us a sense of safety and security, what it is we need to feel protected from disease and despair in tandem, and that is going to look different for each person.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.today.com/health/6-stress-relief-tips-turn-your-walk-meditation-t193714"><strong>How To Take A Walk That Is Good For Your Mental Health</strong></a> (Today) — <em>“Whether it’s a trip to the spa, a ticket to the latest blockbuster at the movie theater or sweating it out at the gym — our go-to modes of de-stressing and clearing our minds have been tabled over the past year… This has left many people in search of safe, socially distant ways to find that inner peace — and walking has proved to be one of the most accessible activities that we can engage in every single day, no matter where we've been quarantined.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Dealing With Climate Anxiety</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/climate-anxiety-makes-good-sense"><strong>Climate Anxiety Makes Good Sense</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“There are profound reasons to hope that we’re about to make serious progress: the sudden arrival of cheap renewable energy; the shifting zeitgeist. (As is often the case, Rebecca Solnit sums them up with particular power.) Even if we catch some breaks from physics, though, it’s going to be a tough few decades. And what will make it toughest may be the (very American) assumption that we have to endure the anxiety by ourselves, in our own heads. I’ve found the simple solidarity of movements at least as useful as the opportunities for action that they provide; just knowing that lots of other people are at work on the same problem is a solace, and a goad to keep working.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-can-you-overcome-climate-dread-1847606185"><strong>How Can You Overcome Climate Dread?</strong></a> (Gizmodo) — <em>“It’s easy these days to slip into black-and-white states of complete and total despair—which, honestly, seems warranted a lot of the time. But what emotions are actually healthy, productive, and realistic? As the planet gets warmer, are we just destined to feel terrible all the time? The answer is “maybe!”—but that doesn’t mean we all have to be paralyzed.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/family/2021/04/helping-kids-deal-with-climate-anxiety"><strong>Helping Kids Deal With Climate Anxiety</strong></a> (National Geographic) — <em>“Once you’ve validated the child’s feelings, help them gain some perspective. ‘You see children saying things like “The world's going to burn up, we’re all going to be dead in 20 years,”—and that's pretty unlikely,’ Clayton says. Helping them find accurate information—for example, explaining that your city will probably see more rain and hotter summers—is more precise and less scary.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-live-to-avoid-natural-disaster-climatologists-2018-8"><strong>We Asked 12 Climate Scientists Where They'd Live In The US To Avoid Future Natural Disasters. Here's What They Said.</strong></a><strong></strong>(Business Insider) — <em>“To figure out what areas are least vulnerable to natural disasters in the future, we asked 12 climate scientists where they would consider living to avoid climate change. All were quick to note that no area is entirely safe, but a few cities could be less vulnerable than the rest.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-the-best-place-to-move-if-youre-worried-about-climate-change/"><strong>Here’s The Best Place To Move If You’re Worried About Climate Change</strong></a> (FiveThirtyEight) — <em>“Turns out, finding a place in the U.S. that is benefiting from climate change is both easy and hard, researchers say. It’s not difficult to find the places at the lowest risk of experiencing the biggest hazards. Popular Science has mapped it using data from a variety of scientific research papers and risk assessment reports. Economists have mapped it based on projected changes in various quality of life indexes. Nonprofits are working on projects that will map it based on flooding risks. But it’s one thing to look at these maps and start dreaming of your climate condo in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. It’s another thing entirely to say that it is a place you should move now.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><strong>General Self Care</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://omny.fm/shows/hidden-brain/cultivating-your-purpose"><strong>You 2.0: Cultivating Your Purpose</strong></a><strong></strong>(Hidden Brain Podcast) — <em>“Having a sense of purpose can be a buffer against the challenges we all face at various stages of life. Purpose can also boost our health and longevity. In the kick-off to our annual You 2.0 series, Cornell University psychologist Anthony Burrow explains why purpose isn't something to be found — it's something we can develop from within.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/do-what-you-love-work-myth-culture/399599/"><strong>Why ‘Do What You Love’ Is Pernicious Advice</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“I think this idea that work somehow makes you a good person is something that is very American to me. There’s this idea that it has something to do with your character as a person. I feel that it’s very ingrained and I don’t completely disavow it, too. Work is held up as something that is more revelatory about your character than the interests you have or the way you care about other people or care for other people. I feel like it comes from people who are earnest in their striving and want to do good things and want to be good people, but it leads to this culture where people are just working all the time.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/richard-seymour-twittering-machine/"><strong>Can We Live Without Twitter?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Nation) — “<em>The problem, however, isn’t that we can’t ‘log off,’ as so many on Twitter implore others to do; the problem is that Twitter has come to define “real life.” A human being who lives until the age of 70 will spend about 50,000 (out of 400,000) of their waking hours on a social media platform. To “log off” is to become an ascetic, disconnected from the ‘real’ (virtual) world. Assuming we can’t uninvent social media—and there’s little to suggest we can—we’re left with two questions: Can Twitter be a politically productive space? And perhaps more important, is it possible to live a healthy online life?”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/travel/who-needs-a-whirlwind-trip-when-you-can-take-it-slow.html"><strong>Who Needs a Whirlwind Trip When You Can Take It Slow?</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New York Times) — <em>“Slow travel grew out of the slow food movement, which emphasizes sustainable, local and organic food, and prizes artisanal traditions. It isn’t new — the appeal of walking the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route in Spain, for example, has endured for centuries. But it’s attracting more travelers now for a variety of reasons: as a salve to social distancing, a response to flight-shaming, a meditative breather or an exercise of pandemic-inspired caution. These more mindful trips involve visiting fewer places and sometimes transiting slower, whether by car, train, bike, foot or canoe.”</em></p>
<h3 id="a-message-from-sirota">A Message From Sirota:</h3>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This past week, the Lake Tahoe region burned, New Orleans was ravaged by a hurricane, cities on the East Coast flooded, Joe Biden reopened more offshore drilling, the pandemic intensified, and Donald Trump made moves to begin running for president again. And for much of it, I was hiking around the continent’s largest sand dunes, taking photographs of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I felt a sense of guilt and regret for staring up at the stars as so many horrible things were happening here on Earth. But that feeling slowly wore off, because I know there’s no way to psychologically survive this time without taking care of yourself. After a year of grueling work, I took a few days off to invest in my own personal form of self care — looking at the heavens and practicing a form of <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2011/01/the-slow-photography-movement-asks-what-is-the-point-of-taking-pictures.html">slow photography</a> as I snap shots of nature. If you’re interested, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTVwsQAnAef/">go here and take a look at the 10 best photos I shot</a> (and if you want to print any of them out, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r0-M47rza-06IWpkBK3_j3F7vfbrI8cR">use the high res versions here</a>!).</p>
<p>Reality these days is an assault of traumatic news, and I can’t offer you any reassurance that the world will feel more stable and hopeful in the near future. On the contrary, things are likely to get even more tumultuous, and <em>The Daily Poster</em> will continue to aggressively report on the corrupt villains creating that tumult.</p>
<p>But I want to urge you to find your own version of self care. When done right, self care isn’t narcissistic self-absorption or sticking your head in the sand — it is an investment in mental resilience during an era when we most need it.</p>
<p>You should read <em>The Daily Poster</em> to know the real story of what’s happening in the world and get some ideas about how to engage in the political arena. But you should also find your own ways to periodically disconnect and let your mind rest and wander. The work of bettering the world is a marathon, not a sprint — and we all have to pace ourselves to keep running that marathon.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this week’s Weekend Reader clips above, you know you are not alone in experiencing pangs of climate panic, pandemic anxiety, and existential dread. Everyone I know is feeling it right now — and those feelings are proof of something good. It proves that you remain present in this world, that you’ve retained your humanity, and that you are still emotionally alive. The trick is to not allow those feelings to overwhelm and consume you.</p>
<p>I admit it’s a tough balance. You have to fight for your sanity every day, and some days you probably feel like you are losing that battle because the news is so bleak. But the fight is easier if we know we’re all in this together, if we remember that there <em>is</em> good news out there (read our weekly You Love to See It!), and if we invest in our own mental health.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that I’m able to occasionally take a few days off work without worrying about job loss, and it’s a travesty that America remains one of the only countries to not require some semblance of paid leave for everyone. But taking care of yourself doesn’t have to be complicated, expensive, or even require huge amounts of time off. It can be as simple as finding a hobby, going for a walk, engaging in meditation, or, last but not least, shutting off the smartphone.</p>
<p>If you can, try to take some time this weekend to rest and reflect — and don’t feel guilty about it. Burnout is the enemy of engagement, and self care is the best way to stave off that burnout. We are all in this together, and need you in this fight for the long haul.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
