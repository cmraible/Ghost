In what’s one of the more dramatic examples, a Hertz location in Gates, New York had a dozen vehicles swiped by thieves sometime in the night of December 11. At first, Hertz thought 17 cars were stolen, however after cross-referencing inventory with other locations that number was changed to 12."

Once inside, they boosted a Chevy Suburban, using it to push a box truck which was parked in front of the gate out of the way. Then they used the big SUV to push the gate open."

From what we know about car thief behavior in 2022, they were probably left in public areas to see if authorities found them using GPS trackers. Thieves often do this for a few days to keep police from finding their chop shop, etc."
