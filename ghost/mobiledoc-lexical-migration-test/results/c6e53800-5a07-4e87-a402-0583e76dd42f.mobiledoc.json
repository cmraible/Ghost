However, the mechanicals are all modern, so this isn’t just some wheezing hunk of scrap."

For this 1972 Camaro he wanted something which borrowed from the design of the 1970s Trans Am road race cars and the result is pretty cool. Among the many modifications is an LS2 and a 6-speed transmission. We’ve heard it’s only driven once a week, to and from church, at speeds under 35 mph (that’s a joke, in case you’re a fact checker or don’t understand the concept of sarcasm)."

He said it was purchased brand new by a family member and has stayed in the family since, so that’s probably why he hasn’t lowered it and air brushed stampeding wild horses down the sides."

However, Jr. revealed he had just purchased a 2019 Silverado that he actually loves because of how it looks. We don’t know what color or trim he has, but it’s probably safe to say it’s a High Country, but that’s just an educated guess."

The man has collected all kinds of stock cars which were wrecked, both by him and other drivers, the empty husks laid to rest in the woods at Dirty Mo Acres. It’s quite the display of racecars surrounded by nature, plants growing through those which have been sitting the longest. However, not just anyone can just go check out the collection since it’s on private property and you can bet there’s tight security, but all the cars are chronicled on the Dale Jr. website. If you have some time to burn, there are plenty of great pictures and a story for each and every car in the graveyard, including some incredibly "
