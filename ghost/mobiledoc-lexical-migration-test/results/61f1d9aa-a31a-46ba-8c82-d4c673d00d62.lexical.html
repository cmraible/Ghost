<p>So, how was 2015 for <em>One Man & His Blog</em>? Pretty good, all things considered. I had much less time than usual to devote to the blog, due to a very successful working year, but I still managed a 15% increase on 2014’s traffic. I hope (and have plans) to significantly better that in 2016. Much of that gain was down to a handful of very successful posts, which you’ll find out more about below.</p>
<p>I really hope to write much more – and do different forms of journalism – through 2016. While training and helping others to do journalism is gratifying (and lucrative), I have a real urge to write more myself. If I get to this time next year without doing so, I’ll be very disappointed indeed.</p>
<p>On the back end, I finally <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/04/vale_movable_type.html">migrated from an ageing Movable Type install</a> to a brand spanking new WordPress install on WP-Engine, considerably upping the server power behind it. Downtime has been minimal this year, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, here’s the top 10 <em>OM&HB</em> posts in 2015:</p>

<h2 id="1-bookerly-amazon%E2%80%99s-new-kindle-font">1. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/01/bookerly_amazons_new_kindle_font.html">Bookerly: Amazon’s new Kindle font</a></h2>

<p>The top post of the year was <em>huge</em> in terms of traffic for me. And I’m very smug about that. For a while I’d been slightly concerned about the disconnect between teaching SEO for journalists – and the fact that I rarely work hard on SEO for this blog. I write it for the regular readers, not the “drive-bys”. When my Fire Tablet got an update adding a new font to the kindle app, and I couldn’t find anything good online about it, I saw the opportunity to write something heavily SEO optimised about it – and reaped the rewards. A couple of links from big sites when the font hit the e-ink readers added to the success. Nice to know that I can do it when I want to.</p>
<h2 id="2-want-to-read-your-ipad-in-the-bath">2. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2014/01/want_to_read_your_ipad_in_the_bath.html">Want to read your iPad in the bath?</a></h2>
<p>2014’s SEO test is still doing the business. And I do, in fact, do this, on the rare occasions I have a bath.</p>
<p>(I shower every day, before you go getting any ideas…)</p>
<h2 id="3-why-your-big-custom-cms-project-is-doomed">3. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/01/publishers-custom-content-management.html">Why your big custom CMS project is doomed</a></h2>
<p>A short, link-based post hitting number three? It’s the content. Too many people out there who have been badly burned by disastrous CMS projects.</p>
<h2 id="4-drink-black-coffee-you-may-be-a-psycho">4. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/10/drink-black-coffee-you-may-be-a-psycho.html">Drink black coffee? You may be a psycho</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/10/killer-coffee.jpg?resize=960%2C640" alt="Killer Coffee" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Another short post that did <em>great</em> traffic numbers for me. And I think we all know why, don’t we?</p>
<p>Mine’s a black Americano, thanks.</p>
<h2 id="5-amazon%E2%80%99s-bookerly-font-arrives-on-e-ink-kindles">5. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/08/amazons-bookerly-font-arrives-on-e-ink-kindles.html">Amazon’s Bookerly font arrives on E Ink Kindles</a></h2>
<p>The follow-up to the year’s big winner couldn’t quite replicate its success – but then, there was much, much more competition for those search terms this time around. I’m still pretty pleased with this.</p>
<h2 id="6-markdown-versus-commonmark-the-ambiguity-and-clarity-dilemma">6. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2014/09/markdown-commonmark-open-source-controversy.html">Markdown versus CommonMark: the ambiguity and clarity dilemma</a></h2>
<p>Another 2014 post in the chart, doing the numbers thanks to search traffic. This was a big topic in a particular niche of the tech/publishing web, and there aren’t a lot of good explainers out there on the topic. I’d accidentally filled that niche, and saw the benefits with consistent traffic over 15 months.</p>
<h2 id="7-pando-erects-paywall-of-irrelevance">7. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/06/pando-erects-paywall-of-irrelevance.html">Pando erects paywall of irrelevance</a></h2>
<p>It appears the appetite for posts mocking the self-important Pando team is nearly as large as <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/06/pando-copyright-abuse.html">their appetite for stealing my photos</a>. I’m glad to have been of service in this instance.</p>
<h2 id="8-backed-typed-a-new-blogging-platform">8. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/02/typed-blog-platform-crowdfunding.html">Backed: Typed, a new blogging platform</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/02/typed-blog-platform.jpg.png?resize=960%2C454" alt="typed-blog-platform.jpg" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This one was a surprise. Typed was – <em>is</em> – a brand new blogging platform created by the good folks at realMac just down the coast from me in Brighton. Their crowdfunding campaign was a great success – and <a href="https://www.typed.com">the platform is now live</a>. It’s great that I was able to help promote that, and I really must hunker down and spend some time using it this year.</p>
<h2 id="9-chef-phil-howard-talks-about-his-drug-addiction">9. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2009/09/chef_phil_howard_talks_about_his_drug_ad.html">Chef Phil Howard talks about his drug addiction</a></h2>
<p>The first piece of <em>really</em> evergreen content on the list. This gets huge spikes of traffic every time Phil Howard is on TV. I’m not sure I can count on the traffic for much longer, though. The embedded video is Flash-based, and that will tend to decay usability and therefore search traffic over time. I’ll be really surprised if this is in the top 10 again next year.</p>
<h2 id="10-pando%E2%80%99s-nicking-my-photos-again">10. <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/06/pando-copyright-abuse.html">Pando’s nicking my photos again</a></h2>
<p>See what I mean about the appetite for posts mocking the self-righteous tech clique over at Pando? They nicked my photo <em>again</em>, and never apologised, even though they change the image when it was pointed out. And then they went and hid behind a paywall. Good riddance, I say…</p>

<p></p>
<p>And that’s it for 2015’s traffic. I suppose I should get on with generating 2016’s traffic.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
