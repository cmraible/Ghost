<p>By now if you haven’t heard the Legend of Florida Man you’ve obviously not been on the internet for years. Well, he’s at it again, this time using a Dodge Charger to lead police on a high-speed chase. Unlike the Duke boys he didn’t make some epic jump over a river to get away. Instead, the pursuit was short and he was in the back of a police cruiser.</p>

<p>According to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office, the whole thing started on November 21 when a Florida Highway Patrol unit spotted a Dodge Charger driving recklessly while traveling west on Interstate 10 in Holmes County. They contacted the Walton County Sheriff’s Office for help with the pursuit after the driver declined to pull over, and deputies were able to catch up to it at the Mossy Head overpass.</p>

<p>The driver, 20-year-old Derick Gray from Ormond Beach, decided pulling a U-turn on I-10 and exiting on 285 North was a way to lose the cops. Well, he was wrong, but we’ll chalk this up to youthful stupidity. Not being fooled, law enforcement was hot on his tail as he exited onto eastbound Highway 90, then turned into the area behind Simply Good BBQ where he pulled up to a densely wooded area.</p>
<p>We’re thinking Gray was planning to loose the cops on foot and he probably would’ve had a K-9 sicced on him, so that wasn’t such a great plan. Also, Gray probably wasn’t on the high school track team because he never made it to the woods. The guy tried hiding in someone’s shed and that person called for help.</p>

<p>It turns out the Dodge Charger was stolen out of Volusia County. Try not to be too shocked that the car wasn’t Gray’s because nobody could’ve seen that coming. Now Gray’s facing multiple charges like fleeing and eluding, grand theft auto, and operating a vehicle without a license. Choices have consequences.</p>
