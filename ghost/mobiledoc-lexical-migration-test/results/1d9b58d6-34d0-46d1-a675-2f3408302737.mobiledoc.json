Reid, one of the young men, saw another teenage boy on the side of the road struggling to change a tire. Out of the kindness of his heart, Reid exited his vehicle to help the boy and immediately tried to steal it. The idiot hit a curb and wrecked the car, it was later discovered that the Mitsubishi Lancer that the second boy was found with had already been stolen by our tire-changing fiend. Both Reid and “tire guy” were apprehended and it seems that there may be justice in the world after all."

Far too often, people get away with stealing other's vehicles and the police seemingly do nothing about it. You can't rely on anyone else to save your car so it's either up to you or luck. In this case, luck was very unkind to the boys and hopefully, they've learned a lesson. Don't try to steal someone else's car right in front of them, wait until they look away."
