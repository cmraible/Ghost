This extra power was accompanied by a dual exhaust system, stiffer shocks, upgraded brakes and a strut tower brace for added tensional strength. Each 2008 Bullitt had a unique ID plate located under the hood on this strut tower brace, and this one indicates that it was the 5,720th of 5,808 Bullitts built that year."
