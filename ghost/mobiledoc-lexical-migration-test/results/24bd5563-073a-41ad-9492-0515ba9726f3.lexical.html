<p>When it comes to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/soccer-player-fined/">soccer or futbol stars</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ronaldo-adds-ferrari-monza/">Ronaldo</a>is one of the greats, and the man has the car collection to match his <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/aubameyang-likes-exotic-supercars/">achievements on the pitch</a>. His latest addition is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bentley-flying-spur-thief-arrested/">Bentley Flying Spur</a>, a car which retails for well into the six digits. For the athlete it was likely the same kind of financial leveraging as the average person buying a new shirt undergoes, which is to say nothing.</p>

<p>The Portuguese soccer superstar was spotted behind the wheel of the Flying Spur as he arrived at the AON Carrington Training Complex for Manchester United recently. While it sells for a healthy £164,000 in the UK, the Bentley is one of the less-expensive cars in the athlete’s garage, if you can believe that.</p>

<p>Back in 2019 Bentley revealed the third generation of the Flying Spur. It features evolved styling, modern technologies, and improved equipment for today’s shoppers. The four-door grand tourer also serves up loads of luxury, with plenty of comfort whether you’re sitting in the front or rear seats. Some go so far as to call it the “best luxury sedan in the world” and we suppose one could make an argument to support that claim.</p>
<p>Since Ronaldo is one of the highest paid futbol players in the world, he can buy virtually anything he wants. The man has a passion for fine automobiles, which explains why he owns a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ronaldo-adds-ferrari-monza/">Ferrari Monza</a>, a Brabus G-Wagon, a McLaren Senna, and the only <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ronaldo-adds-ferrari-monza/">Bugatti La Voiture Noire</a> in existence. That’s just scratching the surface of his undeniably impressive car collection.</p>

<p>We fully expect Ronaldo is far from done collecting rare, expensive cars. While most of his collection is made up of modern vehicles, seeing him add more classics would be a change of pace.</p>
