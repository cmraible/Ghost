A year later, Porsche applied the \"Pink Pig\" livery to a 917/20 that qualified seventh for the 1971 Le Mans race. Aside from being pink, this livery was known for identifying butcher cuts of meat off a pig in German, and the 917/20 was the fastest car in the Le Mans qualification session but crashed while in fifth place during the race."

This livery lasted from 1971 until Brumos Racing was ended operations in 2013, but Porsche introduced a stylized version of the paint scheme on a 911 racecar at the 2019 24 Hours of Daytona. Brumos Racing was based in Jacksonville, Florida, which is where the all-new Brumos Collection museum is located. This museum opened back in January, and it features a number of classic Porsche racecars including a 917K wearing the Gulf Racing livery that was used in the 1970 Steve McQueen film, "
