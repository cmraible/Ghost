<p>That sounds like an impossible combination, but it’s a real possibility thanks to <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Ronald McDonald House Central Valley</a>. The charity is selling raffle tickets to win several cars, including a <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">brand new 2020 Corvette Stingray</a>.</p>

<p>The exact Corvette isn’t available for photos yet – perhaps it’s still being built. However, we do know a few specifics. It’s an <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Elkhart Lake Blue 3LZ</a>, so it’s certainly not a stripped-down model. In addition, it’s got the desirable Z51 performance package.</p>
<p>It could be yours <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">for the price of a raffle ticket</a>. One ticket is just $5, but the more you donate the cheaper each ticket becomes. You can buy 100 tickets for $100, or, even better, you can get 600 tickets for $500. If you missed out on reserving a spot for 2020 production, this could be your chance.</p>

<p>There’s a way to sweeten the pot even further, too. <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Using the code WIN</a>, you can actually double your chances, so that same $500 actually gets you 1200 entries! Amazing!</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/2020-corvette-stingray?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a new Corvette</a> isn’t your style, Ronald McDonald House Central Valley is also raffling off a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Pace Car and a 1966 Chevrolet Corvette. They also auctioned off a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby Cobra</a> replica, which has already been claimed by a lucky winner.</p>
