Not only is it easy to become disoriented, leading to panic, one dive crew documented how easily someone can be injured by the sharp edges of the wreckage. About 7 years ago they descended into the vessel but weren’t wearing hoods. One of the divers received a pretty good gash in his head, the blood trailing out into the water. Thankfully, that blood didn’t attract a shark feeding frenzy and the injury wasn’t bad enough to knock the man unconscious. This does illustrate that when you find an abandoned stash of classic cars it’s always best to exercise caution. Not only can sharp objects be present, the building might not be entirely sound structurally, plus aggressive animals might have made the vehicles or the area around them their home.",

            "text": "I have dived there dozens of times,\" Lievonen shares with Motorious, \"SS Thistlegorm is one of the most interesting wreck diving destinations. The history of the ship and especially the WWII supplies resting in the cargo hold form a unique entity. The wreck is within the limits of recreational diving (depth 16-33m / 52-105ft) and cargo holds can be dived under the guidance of a local diving guide. The ship is lying in an open area without the protection provided by the reefs. For the most part, conditions are good. However, from time to time the currents can be intense and the visibility then limited, making it difficult to examine the outside of the vessel. The destination can be reached by day boat in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt or on a liveaboard diving safari from Hurghada. My strong recommendation for this dive site.\"",
