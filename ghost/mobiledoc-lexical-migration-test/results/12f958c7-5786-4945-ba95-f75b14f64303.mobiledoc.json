Now, some of those budget-friendly rides are getting the high-end restomod treatment, complete with all the luxurious finishes you might expect on something like a Singer Porsche. That might sound like insanity, especially considering the first Mini Remastered, Oselli Edition car was delivered recently to its new owner in Scandinavia, who forked over $140,000 for the bespoke classic Mini."

For those who believe the new Minis aren’t all that mini, plus who pine away for the classic cars but don’t want to deal with the janky interior and poky performance, going to David Brown Automotive in Silverstone, UK might be worth the premium price."

People pay big money for that kind of guaranteed rarity, especially when the fit and finish is of this caliber. The company offers four different Mini builds: the simple Remastered, Oselli Edition, Inspired by Café Racers, and Inspired by Monte Carlo."

David Brown Automotive claims the 0-60 time is 7.8 seconds. This over 70 percent increase in performance is accomplished with the help of Oselli Engineering, hence the name."

If that’s a Mini, great. Just don’t complain when we get a raucous muscle car or a 6-wheel-drive military truck as our plaything."
