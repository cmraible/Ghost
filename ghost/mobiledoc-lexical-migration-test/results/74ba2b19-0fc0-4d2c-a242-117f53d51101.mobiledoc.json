The car also features a removable body-color roof panel so you can soak up the sunshine while cruising those scenic backroads. A set of Bright-Silver-painted 5-spoke aluminum wheels (19x8.5 front, 20x11 rear) sit on all four corners and are wrapped with Michelin rubber (245/35ZR/19 front, 305/30ZR/20 rear). Also, carbon flash side vents along with front and rear grille accents adorn the exterior, and it wears a Z51 rear spoiler. Power-heated mirrors come with integrated turn signal indicators. A car cover comes with the car to protect the beautiful bright paint against the elements wherever you park it."
