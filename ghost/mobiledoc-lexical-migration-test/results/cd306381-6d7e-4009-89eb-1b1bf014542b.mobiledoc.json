Another exciting car added to the museum is the famous Entombed Corvette that spent 27 years in a brick vault inside a Maine grocery store. The exhibit recreates the \"tomb\" of the iconic 1954 Corvette in an attempt to preserve the car and the story behind it. There's even a new exhibit dedicated to the 2014 sinkhole offering a look at all eight cars affected by the natural disaster and a virtual experience of the collapse."
