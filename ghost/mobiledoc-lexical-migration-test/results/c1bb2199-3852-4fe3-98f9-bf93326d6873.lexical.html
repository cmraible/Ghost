Of these models, the most notable and legendary has always been the Chevy Bel Air. During these years, the Bel Air changed in appearance, quite dramatically. During the upcoming Annual Big Boys Toys Sales this weekend, two examples from the Tri-Five Bel Air era are coming up for grabs, and it would be hard to choose which one to put in your collection.</p>

<p>From the first year model, to the last, the 1957 Bel Air is a quintessential classic collectible car. However, this classic is not your grandfatherâ€™s Bel Air. It is built with a massive 555 cubic-inch engine, backed by a M22 transmission. The build features Dart big block, Pro MXX performance aluminum TBF supercharger, power disc brakes, Centerforce clutch, 871 blower, 2-850 com Willy carbs, and dynes at 900-horsepower, with the potential of going into the four digital range.
