<p>One of the most disturbing crime trends we’ve seen has been criminals targeting car dealerships at night. While it’s bad enough when a regular dealer gets cleaned out by a crew of thieves, it’s even worse when someone hits a classic car dealer. To do one more than that, police say 28-year-old Nathan Ryan Wasson crashed a stolen utility truck through the storefront of a classic car dealership in Pleasant View, Tennessee in the wee morning hours of November 2.</p>

<p>Not content just to have crashed into a classic Plymouth ‘Cuda, Camaro, and other collectable cars, Wasson decided to go for the keys and get a better ride than the Kentucky utility truck. He finally chose a convertible Camaro, which he rammed through the front doors and damaged. Instead of taking that Camaro, he selected a second one and fled the scene with police hot on his tail.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, officers lost track of the classic Camaro. Later, a man in a neighboring county called police to say he detained Wasson in his home. It appears Wasson wasn’t done committing crimes for whatever reason, so thankfully that unnamed man put a stop to the spree.</p>

<p>The dealership owner told a local reporter he’s probably out about $40,000 to fix the three Camaros and ‘Cuda. On top of that, to fix the storefront, which includes the doors, he’s looking at another $30,000.  He also remarked that the unsophisticated robbery didn’t seem to have been planned out but instead that Wasson likely just saw an opportunity in the moment.</p>
<p>We have to say, the dealership owner’s resilience in the face of such a senseless act is admirable. We hope he’s able to get compensation for his expenses.</p>
