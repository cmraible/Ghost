Miller founded Carlisle Events with business partner Bill  Miller (no relation) in 1974, and the company has grown to become one of  the largest organizers of classic and collector car events in the  country. Its largest event, Spring Carlisle, is a must-attend event for  enthusiasts, but the Miller team might best be known for the  single-marque event they co-founded called Corvettes at Carlisle. The  largest Corvette event in the world, Corvettes at Carlisle brings  together over 5,000 examples of America's favorite sports car. The  Corvette was also Miller's favorite car; he loved the car so much he  would end up owning 80 of them throughout his life."
