Among some of the other vehicles sold at this auction are a 2013 Ford E350 which sold for $176,000, and one Ferrari 360 spider for $126,000. To say that the acquisition of an old Ford pickup being so pricey is surprising is, to say the least, so why does it command such an exuberant price?"

Holding all of that power together is a stage II chassis from Roadster Shop and a Ford 9-inch rear-end keeping you sturdy and capable. While the True-Trac Positraction rearend and independent front suspension keeps the steering bearable, that rear four-bar setup with coil-overs makes sure that those rear tires stay planted."
