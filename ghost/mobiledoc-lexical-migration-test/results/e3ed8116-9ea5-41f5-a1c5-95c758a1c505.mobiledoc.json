The horrific event, which took place at Lamborghini Sarasota on January 21 in Sarasota, Florida, was captured on camera and uploaded to YouTube. It just shows how low-skill drivers with higher-powered cars and a crowd of people standing on a sidewalk can be a recipe for disaster."

Then a black S550 Mustang pulls out of the parking lot, accelerates hard while merging into the center lane with some obviously wobbly steering, and suddenly veers across the right lane, hopping the curb and hitting the crowd."

However, the Mustang in question is an S550 with an independent rear suspension. We’ve seen other drivers of S550 Mustangs lose control like this, so blaming the suspension and not a lack of skill on the part of the driver carries less weight."
