On the body, you'll find the stunning red and white two-tone that many have come to associate with the first-generation Corvette above all others. That striking visual posture combines with the 350 cubic inch crate motor V8 engine to make a truly inspiring Sports car. That powertrain is capable of pushing out 290 horsepower which might not seem a lot these days but is pretty hefty when you consider how lightweight the car is."

On top of that, under the hood is the L78 396 cubic inch ssv8 engine which was known for its high performance back in the day. This car was given a full restoration and fits perfectly with the Corvette as two prime examples of what made Chevy great in the first place."

It also helps that this one has a three-speed Top Loader manual transmission that makes driving very fun even despite its age and size. These three vintage cars are perfect for anyone who likes a wide variety of classics which is exactly why you should consider them for your next automotive purchase."
