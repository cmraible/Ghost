<p>Just like any build, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tyler-hoover-sings-praises-for-restomods/">restomods</a> can run the range from tacky or weak to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-chevelle-restomod/">absolutely fierce</a>, and fortunately this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1969-chevrolet-chevelle/">1969 Chevrolet Chevelle</a> is of the latter variety. Shown off recently at the Quarantine Cruise 10 in Southern California, it’s not only one beast of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/most-popular-muscle-car/">muscle car</a> but the thing also has a cool story behind it.</p>
<blockquote><em>See ten awesome Chevelles <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-baddest-chevelles/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>One of the coolest things about this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-baddest-chevelles/">Chevelle</a> is most of the custom work was done by the owner, Matt. While it’s great that people turn their car over to a shop to do all the work since they get a clean, professional job in return, as you can see in the video this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/worst-diy-car-modifications/">DIY job</a> looks excellent. Not everyone has that level of talent, patience, and knowledge, so we respect when people go for it and do a fantastic job.</p>

<p>As you can see already, Matt converted the trim he kept on the car from chrome to black, giving it a much more sinister appearance. He also shaved different parts of the trim and had a billet grille custom made for the car. There are LED lights, no badging, and big Forgeline black wheels for a strong statement.</p>

<p>Not only does this Chevelle look good, it’s packing some serious heat. The 454 small block V8 has been bored and stroked, plus a big intake and other upgrades were installed. As a result, it’s pushing a mighty 700-horsepower. While that’s a lot of power to handle, it’s balanced out by the modern coilovers at all 4 wheels and Wilwood disc brakes, because being able to stop and corner is pretty essential to driving.</p>
<p>For the interior there’s a 2015 Chevy Camaro dash fitted, but all the digital gauges are replaced by analog units. A flat-bottom steering wheel, race seats, and other details add a modern performance vibe.</p>
<p>As for the story about the car, you need to watch the video to hear it for yourself.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIMxkdIRFNE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
