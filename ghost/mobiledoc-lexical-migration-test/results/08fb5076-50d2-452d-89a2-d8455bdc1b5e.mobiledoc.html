<p>Just recently, the <a href="https://twitter.com/SplatoonJP">Japanese Splatoon Twitter Page</a> showed off some new characters that we will soon be able to encounter in the upcoming Octo Expansion.</p>
<p>We’ve taken a few screenshots, check them out…</p>

<div id="attachment_1656" style="width: 1461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1656" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1656" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion.png?resize=900%2C506" alt="Splatoon 2 Octo Expansion" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion.png?w=1451&ssl=1 1451w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion.png?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion.png?resize=768%2C431&ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion.png?resize=1024%2C575&ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion.png?resize=1300%2C730&ssl=1 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p>The characters on the left appear to be some kind of fish-human business man hybrid. The middle character seems to be some grapes (correct me if I’m wrong). And the character on the right is the Blob with a Walkman wearing tennis shoes…</p>

<div id="attachment_1657" style="width: 1467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1657" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1657" src="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-2.png?resize=900%2C507" alt="Splatoon 2 Octo Expansion 2" width="900" height="507" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-2.png?w=1457&ssl=1 1457w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-2.png?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-2.png?resize=768%2C433&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-2.png?resize=1024%2C577&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-2.png?resize=1300%2C733&ssl=1 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p>In the second image, we see a high-school nucleus jock, a… something (I’m not very good with marine biology) that likes to read and octopi children with long heads, cool shirts and hats.</p>
<p>
<div id="attachment_1658" style="width: 1463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1658" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1658" src="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-3.png?resize=900%2C508" alt="Splatoon 2 Octo Expansion 3" width="900" height="508" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-3.png?w=1453&ssl=1 1453w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-3.png?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-3.png?resize=768%2C433&ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-3.png?resize=1024%2C578&ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Splatoon-2-Octo-Expansion-3.png?resize=1300%2C734&ssl=1 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

</p>
<p>And in the last image, we have some clamlike things with necks and googly eyes (looks like something from Banjo-Kazooie), some seahorses on a pension and some fish with outdated phones.</p>
