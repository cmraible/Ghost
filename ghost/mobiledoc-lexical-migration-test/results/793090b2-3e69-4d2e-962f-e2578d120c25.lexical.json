The extended fender flares create a wide dominating presence and the signature dual mid exit exhaust helps to sell the car's overall aesthetic as a pro-touring beast. This tire spinning monster is also packing a full set of three-piece wheels from New Gen Wheels. Possibly the coolest part about this car however is what could be under the hood. Our first thought is a 454-cid big-block but swapping in something more unconventional could be cool too.
