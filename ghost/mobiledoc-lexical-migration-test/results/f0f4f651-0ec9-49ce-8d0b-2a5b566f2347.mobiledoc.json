We’ve seen so many cases of crooks breaking into a dealer showroom, swiping keys, and unlocking whatever vehicle they want to take, it’s almost normal and that’s disgusting. However, this story out of Nashville, Tennessee of a Dodge Charger stolen from a used car dealer puts a new twist on the dealership theft story."
