<p>There’s a fascinating piece from David Carr on the <em>New York Times</em> website today, looking at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/facebook-offers-life-raft-but-publishers-are-wary.html?referrer=&_r=1">relationship between Facebook and news publishers</a>. But it needs to be read with caution. Some parts of it make me uneasy. It’s very much filtered through a “news publishers are <em>important</em>” view of the world, and it makes me question whether Facebook is as committed as Carr suggests. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The social network now has over 1.3 billion users — a fifth of the planet’s population and has become a force in publishing because of its News Feed, which has been increasingly fine-tuned to feature high-quality content, the kind media companies produce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That misses the point, I think. The News Feed is fine-tuned to show photos and videos from your friends, and a small selection of high quality content items – and that value of “quality” can vary hugely depending on the social neighbourhood of the Facebook user. See what I mean about a news publisher-centric view of the world?</p>
<p>Still, the intersection of Facebook, mobile and news publishers is an interesting one. Facebook is a huge traffic driver – Twitter pales in comparison – and publishers have been terribly slow in adapting to mobile publishing. Will publishers end up handing too much power to the big blue giant is a rush for Zuckerberg’s users?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One possibility it mentioned was for publishers to simply send pages to Facebook that would live inside the social network’s mobile app and be hosted by its servers; that way, they would load quickly with ads that Facebook sells. The revenue would be shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving people one less reason to leave Facebook will not be good for any of us, I suspect.</p>
<p>Some advice for publishers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anything Facebook is doing is about preserving Facebook, not the news business</li>
    <li>Never rely on one traffic source. Facebook makes sense as part of a search/social/e-mail/app mix</li>
    <li>Always look at how you can bring Facebook readers back to your site at some point</li>
    <li>Take any advice you can on improving your mobile experience from them.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few other things worth commenting on in Carr’s piece:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For traditional publishers, the home page may soon become akin to the print edition — nice to have, but not the primary attraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any traditional publisher that still thinks that the homepage <em>is</em> the primary attraction is in a world of trouble already. This has not been the case for a long time.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the last few months, more than half the visitors to The New York Times have come via mobile — the figure increases with each passing month — and that percentage is higher for many other publishers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further evidence that we’re right at the mobile tipping point. So many publishers have now crossed the 50% mobile threshold, that if you’re not, there’s probably something very wrong with your site.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
