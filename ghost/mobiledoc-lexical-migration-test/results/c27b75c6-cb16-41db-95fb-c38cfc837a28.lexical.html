<p>Many people celebrate the Porsche 928 as a solid performance car which offered a much-needed departure from the Porsche 911s philosophy. Of course, those who really want to experience what the car could really offer should go for something like this <a href="https://www.aicauto.com/gallery/?content=1983-porsche-928-s-5-speed-quartz-metallic-56k-miles?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1983 Porsche 928 S</a> being offered for sale through <a href="https://www.aicauto.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">AIC Auto</a>. This German car is completely unique and very original, making it a prime acquisition for collectors or dedicated enthusiasts.</p>

<p>For starters, this car was special ordered in Germany and subsequently built to US specifications. The dealer thinks the odd move was done as a factory car. What is known is the 928 S was sold by Porsche in Stuttgart back in 1985. From there it was transported to Washington, DC, where the car’s first owner used it.</p>

<p>Of course, this Porsche wasn’t driven much since then, with a mere 56,000 miles showing on the odometer. As it passed from one owner to the next, that beautiful Rausch Quartz metallic paint has been well cared-for. Also, the full hand-stitched Natural Brown leather interior looks fantastic. Everything from the factory wheels to all the switchgear has also been almost perfectly preserved.</p>
