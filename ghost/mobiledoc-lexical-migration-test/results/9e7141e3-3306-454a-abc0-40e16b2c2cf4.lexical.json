Internet commerce is peaking,\nand there is a high demand for so many types of products. You can start a small\nonline business with much smaller costs. However, you may discover your\npersonal savings aren’t enough, and you need extra funding to get things going.\nWhile you measure your options, take a close look at short-term business loans,\nthey may be exactly what you are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is E-commerce?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what it is, and\nyou see it every day. You are bombarded with it every time you go online. If\nyou open your email or take a look at your Facebook page, there will be dozens\nof ads inviting you to get a great deal at whatever they are selling. You may\nfind it annoying at times, but the truth is online shopping has its benefits.\nIf you think about it, you will realize you have been taking this road more\noften in the last years. From books to toys or clothing, you have probably used\nonline stores more than you thought. The advantages are clear: better prices,\nfast delivery and you can exchange the product if you are not happy with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is e-commerce\nfinancially speaking? Well, over 10% of all retail shopping in the U.S. And the\npercentage is growing every year. In 2020 it’s expected to reach 12.4%. That is\nmuch more impressive than it seems at first glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Finance your\nE-commerce Business</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bizflyfunding.com/Industries/e-commerce/\">An e-commerce business</a> doesn’t have to face\nthe costs connected to a ‘brick and mortar’ business. So, you don’t have to\nworry about paying a huge rent for a strategically placed store. But that’s not\nthe end of it. You still have to worry about marketing and operating expenses,\nfor instance. All that means money. And the budget may turn out to be greater\nthan what you had planned. You can’t stop now, so it’s time to look for funding\nto keep your business on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bank may be the\nfirst thing that comes to your mind, but you need to make sure you qualify for\na loan first. Banks are usually the most strict lenders, there is a lot of\ndocumentation involved and many requirements and fees. So, it may be time to\nfind alternative sources. Here are a few options for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An SBA loan – these are loans that are partially\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration. They come with much lower\ncosts but are also really hard to access due to the difficult process and the\nhigh competition.</li><li>Grants – that’s basically free money for your\nbusiness. They sound amazing but are extremely hard to access. Not to mention,\nyou have to spend the money exactly the way you planned in your proposal. </li><li>Crowdfunding – that means you will actually be asking\nfor donations in exchange for future rewards. It can be successful depending on\nthe profile of your business, but it’s a long and difficult process, and there\nis no guarantee you will get the funds you need.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Are Short-term Business\nLoans the Answer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the options\nmentioned above don’t sound right for you and banks aren’t exactly accessible\neither, you may want to consider a <a href=\"https://lifeguideblog.com/guide-to-short-term-small-business-loans/\">short-term business\nloan</a>. These are loans you can take to cover your operating expenses, to buy\nmaterials or some equipment, things that keep your business going. The sums\naren’t huge, so short-term is convenient, you don’t want to get into a long and\nultimately expensive loan unless you really have to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A short-term business\nloan requires no collateral, and it’s usually offered for a year or less. The\ninterest is medium, but that’s good for an unsecured loan. Actually, the\ngeneral terms make it accessible for most businesses. It is true that it has a\nhigher threshold for qualifications than other types of loans, like bad credit\nbusiness loans. But if you have a healthy business and have the revenue you\nneed to cover the rates, it can be the help you need to take your business one step\nfurther.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out if this is the loan you need, do a little online research. Take a look at the available options, and there are many lenders that can help you get the money you need. BizFly Funding, for example, offers up to 24 months to pay the loan off. No matter what lender you choose, make sure you carefully read all the details and that you are making an informed decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/05/hiring-people-small-business.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51554\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/05/hiring-people-small-business.png 974w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/05/hiring-people-small-business-300x108.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/05/hiring-people-small-business-768x276.png 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2018/05/hiring-people-small-business-610x219.png 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Are Short-term Business\nLoans Right for an E-commerce Business?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a loan for a\nrelatively short period and with medium interest sounds good, but is it useful\nfor your e-commerce business? What can you actually do with that money? Quite a\nlot, really. You can buy the products, and set up a rich inventory, buy new\nequipment, hire more people, rent more workspace if necessary. You can also\nimprove your marketing strategy and aim for better long-term revenues. This\ntype of loan seems tailored for an e-commerce business. And if you want to find\nout more, just fill out an application and find out all you need to know about\nit.
