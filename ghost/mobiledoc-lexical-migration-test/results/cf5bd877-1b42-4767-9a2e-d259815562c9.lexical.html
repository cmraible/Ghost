<hr>
<p>You can never have too many Tri-Five Chevies. We'll admit, in our younger days, we sure did get bored of seeing them at every single Saturday night cruise-in. However, as we've grown older, we've developed an appreciation for <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">these rolling symbols of Americana</a>.</p>

<p>Some things are popular because they're just that good, and the 1955-1957 Chevrolets definitely fall into that category. <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This 1955 Bel Air</a> is about as typical as it gets for a Tri-Five street machine. That's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>First impressions are everything, and this <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">classic '55 Chevy</a> nails it from the word "go." Its classic two tone red and white color combo is accented by a set of staggered, eight hole Weld Racing polished aluminum wheels.</p>

<p>The rears are about as wide as you can go without tubbing the rear, and they tuck into the partially-covered rear wheel wells perfectly. It's <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a classic, tough look</a>.</p>
<p>It's enough to make you forgive the fact that this is a two-door post instead of a more desirable hardtop. If we can be honest with you for a moment, we actually prefer the two-door post to the hardtop when it comes to '55s. It <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">just looks "right"</a> to us.</p>

<p>Under the hood, you'll find a rebuilt, warmed-over 350 cubic inch small block from a 1969 Camaro backed up by a four speed automatic overdrive transmission. We're sure that <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this machine</a> moves out pretty nicely.</p>
<p>The tan interior is just as nice as the rest of the car, and looks like a pleasant place to spend time. If you'd like to slide behind the wheel yourself, you can bid on it at <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851878-1955-Chevrolet-Bel-Air&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Awesome Joe Auctions</a>.</p>
