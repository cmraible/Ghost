Yet, that’s exactly what’s happened on the island of  Guernsey...</h3>
<p>As Britain finally gets to enjoy some much-anticipated spring sunshine, many choose to make a start on gardening plans for the year ahead. What isn’t generally anticipated is a classic car holding up proceedings…</p>
<p>It seems things were very different in Rue du Felconte, on the island of Guernsey, where homeowner Tracy Ward and her father Brian Russell discovered the remains of a luxurious <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Daimler">Daimler</a> from the 1940s or 1950s.</p>
<p>Having bought the new home in November of 2017, Tracy had decided that it was time to tackle the rather overgrown back garden. She enlisted the help of her parents – and a weed-covered rockery soon revealed an unexpected surprise.</p>

<p>Upon hitting an unyielding object beneath the surface, the family thought they’d found the remains of a vintage tractor, owing to the fact that the end of the garden had previously been part of a field.</p>
<p>However, as the family continued to dig, they uncovered a rusted chassis as well as twisted metal window frames, decaying leather upholstery and broken glass – all of which confirmed they had actually discovered the remnants of a car.</p>

<p>Further excavation led to the discovery of an engine block, gearbox and front bumper, as well as a number plate with the registration <em>GUK 880</em>.</p>
<p>Tracy said she was ‘very surprised’ by the car’s presence on her property, while her father Brian added: ‘There’s plenty more underneath.’</p>

<p>Local motoring enthusiasts were keen in their efforts to further identify the car, which had been confirmed as a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Daimler">Daimler </a>by automotive historians. This far, clues as to the vehicle’s provenance had come only from the registration number and an information plate that would have been fitted to the gearbox.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that the mystery motor possessed a chassis suggested that it was constructed prior to the 1960s. It was believed that the Daimler may have originally come from the Wolverhampton or Birmingham area, and that it had a black exterior and dark red upholstery.</p>
<p>A tentative manufacture date of 1949 had been suggested, with guesses as to the exact model favouring the DB18 Consort, such as we see below:</p>

<p>Speaking about the find to the<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-43638944"> BBC</a>, Heather Fattorini of the Guernsey Old Car Club said the reasons for the car’s burial were ‘all a bit of an unknown’, and suggested that a previous owner of the house may have started renovating the vehicle before giving up and putting a rockery over the car to hide it.</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of modern recycling centres, it was fairly common for non-combustible rubbish to be hidden in the garden; numerous baths, sinks, engines and paving slabs have been found beneath similar rockeries in the past few decades. Not to mention the odd asbestos roof or two.</p>

<p>Club president Michael Fattorini added: ‘It’s a Daimler, there’s no question about that. The radiator is a Daimler radiator, the plate on the gearbox is a Daimler plate.’</p>
<p>Since the unusual garden discovery, Tracy Ward posted about the car on social media, saying: ‘Ideally, if it’s of interest to anybody we’d like them to come and take it away. If not claimed, it’s likely to be reburied, or taken to the scrap yard.’</p>
<p>As far as we are aware, the remains were picked for parts before then being recycled.</p>
