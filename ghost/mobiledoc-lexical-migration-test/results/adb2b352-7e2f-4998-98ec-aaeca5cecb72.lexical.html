<h3 id="standard-mgb-not-quite-enough-the-mgc-has-all-the-boxes-ticked-heres-one-for-sale-in-the-motorious-classifieds">Standard MGB not quite enough? The MGC has all the boxes ticked. Here's one for sale in the Motorious classifieds</h3>
<p>If a stock <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=MGB">MGB</a> doesn’t scratch the itch and satisfy your heavy right foot, there are a number of other classic British sports cars begging for your attention. Yet, one that often remains overlooked is the B's psychotic brethren; British Leyland's infamous 'widow making' <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/5525/1969-mg-mgc">MGC</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 1967, for satisfying your inner Stirling Moss on a budget, Abingdon began producing the rebel of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=MG">MG</a> family. With the C unleashed onto the buying public for those wanting more brutish power than the four-cylinder <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=MGB">MGB</a> could muster, trees and hedgerows were no longer safe.</p>
<p><em><strong>More Classic Brits!<a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/351070/morris-minor-british-for-sale">Why the Morris Minor is really Britain's greatest car</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/350856/land-rover-discovery-ii-morris-leslie">Check out the perfect Land Rover Discovery!</a></strong></em><br><br><br><br>Originally nothing more than an attempt to extend the appeal and lifespan of the MGB shape, injecting a dollop of extra horsepower by inserting a straight-six C-series engine under the bonnet, the C made perfect sense on paper. After the demise of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Austin-Healey+3000">Austin-Healey 3000</a>, there was a gap in the market ready to be filled with the B’s more powerful, more desirable relative.</p>

<p>Even though the MGB was still selling by the bucket load, the steroid-driven MGC filled the vacuum rather nicely to start with, bringing profit for MG to further develop vehicle range and quality.</p>
<p>The resulting surge in power was impressive. Nought-60mph could now be achieved in 10 seconds, and acceleration continued all the way to 120mph – making the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/5525/1969-mg-mgc">MGC</a> one of the fastest GT cars sensible money could buy. Yet, there was a hidden clause with the MGC: understeer.</p>

<p>The urban legend suggests that incorrect tyre pressures from new (and particularly with press launch cars) were to blame. The model quickly garnished a reputation for murdering more inexperienced drivers, fast becoming the 'widow maker' on wheels. Although efforts were made to sort the C's ungodly handling, the car's image was soon tarnished. <br><br>With that cast-iron C-series powerplant up front, and torsion bar front suspension in place of the B's coil spring set-up, the C was always going to understeer heavily. It also devoured fuel at an alarming rate – even by 1960s standards. Unable to capture the imagination of potential buyers, the MGC died away after less than 24 months in production.</p>

<p>Even now, the MGC isn't held in the same high regard as its contemporaries and, while it might not have been the replacement for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Austin-Healey">Austin-Healey</a> everyone hoped for, it makes for a magnificent cruiser.</p>
<p>Owners now understand that it's more GT than an out-and-out sports car, and the smoothness and torque of the six-cylinder engine is perfectly suited to that role.</p>

<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/5525/1969-mg-mgc">MGC</a> makes a great classic car purchase. It produces a supreme exhaust note and roars when pushed, churning out enough power to make driving a more relaxed affair – especially when compared to its smaller-engined relation.</p>
<p>Trouble is, finding a good example can be tricky. Once worth $50 and a packet of chips, almost all the MGCs built were driven into the ground or scrapped. Luckily, the perfect example has cropped up for sale through Motorious courtesy of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/5525/1969-mg-mgc">Classic Auto Mall</a>.
