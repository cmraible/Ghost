<p>The Porscheâ€™s 1600cc rear-mounted engine is considered the most powerful pushrod four-cylinder engine Porsche has ever produced, not counting the race Carrera four-cam engine. The naturally aspirated four-cylinder has an output of 94-bhp and a maximum torque at 91 lb/ft and can reach a top speed of 115 miles per hour. A four-speed manual transmission shifts power down to the rear wheels.</p>
<p>Its exterior is slathered in a shiny Silver Metallic and comes equipped with an electronically operated sunroof. Original chrome-plated slotted steel wheels wrapped with Dunlop rubber sit on all four corners, and it comes with a fifth full-sized spare in the trunk. The car has 41.609 miles on the clock. Open the doors to a contrasting bright red interior that looks as if it has never been touched.</p>

<p>For the 1964 model year, Porsche produced 14,151 of the 356 model cars. Porsche introduced the new 911 this same year but continued to sell the 356 in North America through 1965 due to high demand. While the Porsche 911 was a capable car, it was heavier and not yet established like the 356 at the time.</p>
<p>If this fun little Porsche would make the perfect addition to your garage, contact Symbolic International to get behind the wheel. The 356SC is a fun little car that would make any classic car or Porsche enthusiast look forward to cruising on sunny weekends, with the sunroof open, of course. These Porsche 356SC cars don't change often, so this is the perfect chance to snag it up while you can.</p>
