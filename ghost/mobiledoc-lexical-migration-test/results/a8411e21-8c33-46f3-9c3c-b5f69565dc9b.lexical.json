This has a lot of reasons behind it including engine options, styling, and suspension focuses.

One generation that perfectly exemplifies this is the Fox Body but there was always one thing that was wrong with it. It has basically no power from the factory.",

Winding down the road, the fiery supercharger makes a wonderful sound as it throws the vehicle around on the road.

Most of this combination’s benefits stem from the fact that the Foxbody is nearly 2,000lbs lighter than the Charger or Challenger Hellcat. Overall, this is a wild piece that uses raw power and a light frame to showcase the best of both platforms.",
