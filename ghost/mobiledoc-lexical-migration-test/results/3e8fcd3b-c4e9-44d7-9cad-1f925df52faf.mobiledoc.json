Ultimately it’s up to you, though: If you can’t have a good time hanging out with someone because of how they feel about billionaire space jaunts or cryptocurrency, then don’t hang out with them.

As strange as it is for you to be seeing a low-key billionaire fanboy, it’s probably just as foreign for them to get a glimpse into your world and view on things. Maybe they’ve never been to a protest, taken a door-knocking shift, or gone to parties where people get drunk and talk about one-on-ones and Franz Fanon. Maybe they’ll like it, maybe they won’t! But chances are it’ll be new and it might take them a little time and handholding to adjust."

That is, you should probably stop seeing someone if the main reason you’re doing so is to bring them over to your side. Spend your time and energy elsewhere!
