After all, he used the money he allegedly gained through ill means to buy a classic car, something we’re told almost no Millennial is interested in these days. Or is it now just Gen Z that’s characterized that way? Anyway, it’s a dumb stereotype but one that’s repeated often."

Maybe he’ll reach a plea deal with the prosecutor or maybe he’ll have his day in court, but either way it’s doubtful he’ll keep the car."
