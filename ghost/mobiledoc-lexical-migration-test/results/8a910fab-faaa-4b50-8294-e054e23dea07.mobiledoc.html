<p>Benedict Evans in <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter">his newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>As I’ve written previously, you can believe both that Twitter was very badly managed (and over-staffed, with a third more FTEs than Snap and a lot of people not doing very much) and badly in need of a shake-up, and also believe that Elon’s arrival has been, well, chaotic. His tweeting in particular has been careless at best, retweeting conspiracy theories and replying to notorious trolls, which has damaged trust with users and especially advertisers.</blockquote>
<p>Hard to disagree with that…</p>
<p>But, wait…</p>

<p>Yup. Twitter is <em>growing its users</em> amongst the chaos. There's only one suitable GIF:</p>
