<p>From 1971 to 1992, Italian automaker De Tomaso produced it’s most popular model, <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11125">the Pantera</a>. In all, only 7,260 were produced. These rare sports cars featured a mid-mounted 5.8-liter Cleveland engine and a ZF 5 speed manual transaxle. Ford began <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11125">importing the Pantera</a> in 1971 but the quality of the hand-built Carrozzeria Vignale bodies of the early Panteras did not meet Ford’s quality standards. This prompted Ford’s involvement in the manufacturing process which resulted in a much higher quality car. In 1972, the Cleveland engine was updated to a four-bolt main block that utilized a camshaft ground to Cobra Jet specs. Despite this valiant effort to make up for the lower compression ratio required by government regulation, the new engines were rated at 266-horsepower. Even though the new engine was slightly less powerful than the previous year’s, <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11125">the car</a> was still quick, stylish, and fun to drive and it was named Road Test Magazine's Import car of the year in 1973.</p>
