This isn’t anything like the desolate desert highways in the western US where signs announce “speed patrolled by aircraft” yet there’s nothing in the sky. Instead, Maryland law enforcement means business."

The high-intensity speed enforcement effort began in the middle of the day. Both marked and unmarked police cars made 19 different traffic stops in just two and a half hours. They issued 24 citations and give warnings for what the department called in a press release “egregious speed violations.”"

We would like to know what kind of car they were doing that in, but police understandably don’t want to disclose that information when they’re focusing on scaring everyone straight."

While speeding was the focus of the latest sweep, police say they’ve not only had to respond to a number of crashes, aggressive driving in general is up. That seems to be the case in many parts of this country as well as in other nations. We’re sure there are plenty of burgeoning theories about why this might be, but most reasonable people should agree it’s a problem."

They’ll be concentrating not just on speeding and aggressive driving but also driver distraction and “occupant protection” which we would interpret as seatbelt use, but it might entail other things like kids strapped in approved seats. Police in Maryland are also asking citizens to report any careless or reckless driving."
