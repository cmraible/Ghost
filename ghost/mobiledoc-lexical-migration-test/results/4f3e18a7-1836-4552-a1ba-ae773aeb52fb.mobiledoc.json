No estimates have been given as to how much Gooding & Co. is expecting the F50 to sell for, but these Ferraris have been consistently selling for upwards of $2.5 million in recent years including one that sold for $3.2 million range earlier this year. All it would take is a price higher than $2.6 million to break the record set by a 2003 Ferrari Enzo back in June for the most expensive car ever sold online."
