If you suddenly find the guy along with a film crew on your property, chances are either you have a really cool car sitting in your garage or you have a lot of cool cars rotting outside. In this episode of Barn Find Hunter, it’s definitely more of the latter. In fact, Tom tracks down a huge assortment of rough classic muscle cars sitting out in the open in Lake City, Michigan. Even better, the guy’s actually willing to part ways with the vehicles instead of claiming he’s restoring each and every one.",
