The aftermath looks like something out of a movie, well a movie made in the 90s before crappy CGI took over, but it is quite real. Police say this was the handiwork of a gang member running from officers, not Wil E. Coyote chasing after his bird friend, so truth is stranger or at least as strange as fiction."

Little did they know it had just been stolen and the theft wasn’t report to police yet. Instead of pulling over like a good little citizen, the driver decided to show them what an American muscle car can do. Unfortunately, the guy couldn’t handle an American muscle car."

With driving skills like this, we have to admit the suspect is probably more than qualified to participate in a few street takeovers, if he doesn’t already have a big Instagram following for his shenanigans."

Because that county has been so tough on crime, we’re just not shocked they wouldn’t issue a PRCS violation hold for Vega, meaning Riverside Police Department couldn’t add yet another charge to the long list. Even without that, Vega’s bail was set at $100,000."
