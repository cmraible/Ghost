<p>For many GM faithful, this <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0120/driving-into-summer/lots/r0008-1970-pontiac-trans-am/887298?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1970 Pontiac Trans Am</a> is a type of holy grail, a unicorn they want to desperately attain. That’s especially true now that the Pontiac brand has been laid six feet under so many years ago, making its rich history that much more valuable. Now, thanks to <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">RM Sotheby’s</a><a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0120?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Online Only: Driving Into Summer auction</a> starting today.</p>

<p>This is a true numbers-matching 1970 Pontiac Trans Am with many desirable attributes. For example, it has retained the factory-original 400 Ram Air III V8, four-speed manual transmission, plus an upgraded Hurst shifter. Considering Pontiac only made 1,769 Trans Ams with the Ram Air III and manual transmission for 1970, this was a pretty rare bird even when new. Then consider how many of those haven’t survived or no longer retain their original powertrain and that number shrinks considerably.</p>

<p>From nose to tail, this Trans Am is a real looker. The Polar White exterior features all the factory badging, decals, and stripe. The Medium Bright Blue interior is also a model of perfection. A rotisserie restoration ensured no part of the car was left untouched, elevating it to a show-quality vehicle you can display with extreme pride. It also helps that since the restoration, only 789 miles have been put on the muscle car.</p>
<p>Quite a few goodies were included on this Pontiac Trans Am from the factory, which it retains in working order. Among the items is a Rally gauge cluster with tach and clock, dual horns, Formula steering wheel, Rally II wheels, pushbutton radio, and shoulder belts for the driver as well as the front passenger. An upgraded sound system and air conditioning have both been discretely added for increased comfort.</p>
