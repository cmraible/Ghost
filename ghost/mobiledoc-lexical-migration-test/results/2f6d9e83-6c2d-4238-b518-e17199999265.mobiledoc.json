According to Facebook users who were on scene, the pickup truck was towing a camper when it suffered some sort of mechanical fault. That’s when they say the driver went out of his way to find a pull-off, keeping the flames from the surrounding vegetation as much as possible. They then claim the driver put down the camper stands in case the truck’s brakes failed, keeping the flaming wreckage from rolling backward, making a bad situation worse."
