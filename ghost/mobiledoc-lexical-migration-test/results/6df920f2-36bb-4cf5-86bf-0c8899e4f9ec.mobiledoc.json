If this teaser does become a reality, it would be the first time the Jeep Wrangler has ever received a factory V8 engine. The Jeep CJ-7 offered a V8 up until 1980, and since then (including the 1987-present Jeep Wrangler), it has been a series of four-and six-cylinder engine options. "

Although the JL Wrangler was supposed to offer half doors when it launched for the 2018 model year, this feature never panned out. The sketch clearly shows a version of the Wrangler's removable door without a full-framed window, but it doesn't have the unique \"donut\" cut out that was originally revealed on the JL. Previous generations of the Wrangler (JK, TJ and YJ) have all offered half doors."
