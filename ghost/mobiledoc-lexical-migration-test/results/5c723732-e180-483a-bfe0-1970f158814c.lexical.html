<h3 id="weed-the-people">Weed The People</h3>
<p>At the start of 2014, as a Colorado-based freelance writer, I began reporting on the launch of the world’s first legalized cannabis industry. For the next four years, I covered the legalization of marijuana for publications large and small. I attended a flashy cannabis convention in Las Vegas, shadowed the country’s top marijuana prohibitionist in Washington, D.C., explored the country’s only government-run pot shop in Washington state, and embedded with old-school marijuana farmers in the California hills.</p>
<p>At the end of my time on the beat, I came away with an unexpected realization: Legal cannabis, despite decades of strict prohibition and societal taboos, was shaping up to become just like any other business.</p>
<p>That development, as illustrated by <em>The Lever</em>’s coverage this week, is both a relief — and a cause for concern.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>The upside to cannabis becoming boring? None of the apocalyptic things that legalization opponents predicted came to pass. Criminal activity <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/03/legal-marijuana-is-finally-doing-what-the-drug-war-couldnt/">didn’t skyrocket</a>, teens didn’t <a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/states-legalize-marijuana-adolescents-problems-pot-decline/">didn’t all become stoners</a>, and the highways <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-marijuana-traffic-death/after-states-legalized-medical-marijuana-traffic-deaths-fell-idUSKBN14H1LQ">didn’t become death traps</a>. Most importantly, the <a href="https://drugpolicy.org/issues/race-and-drug-war">racist harms</a> of the country’s long, fruitless drug war began, little by little, to recede.</p>
<p>Such positive developments are likely why <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/356939/support-legal-marijuana-holds-record-high.aspx">two in three Americans</a> now support legalizing marijuana, And they are likely why two weeks ago President Joe Biden, a major architect of the War on Drugs, conceded it was time for a change, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/">declaring</a>: “Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs.”</p>

<p>Biden <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-bidens-midterm-marijuana-play/?ref=Lever+Daily-newsletter">announced</a> he was pardoning all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, called on state governors to follow his lead, and directed his administration to expeditiously review rescheduling cannabis so it will no longer be deemed a highly dangerous substance with no medical use.</p>
<p>While the moves were incremental and limited by caveats, they are still historic concessions by a former drug warrior — and set the stage for more sweeping reforms.</p>
<p>But there is also a serious downside to cannabis turning into a typical industry. Just like every other U.S. business, that means marijuana is at risk of being shaped by political machinations and dominated by corporate greed.</p>
<p><em>The Lever </em>illustrated the former phenomenon earlier this week, when we revealed how Republican governors were rejecting Biden’s call to pardon people with low-level marijuana convictions after receiving <a href="__GHOST_URL__/gop-govs-reject-cannabis-pardons-after-getting-private-prison-cash/">major donations</a> from the private prison industry. It’s bad enough that people are languishing behind bars because of cannabis. It’s even worse if they are forced to remain there not because of some twisted conception of justice or community safety, but simply because private prison contractors want to keep making money.</p>
<p>Prison companies aren’t the only for-profit businesses working to shape cannabis reform efforts. Opioid manufacturers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/02/23/senator-calls-out-big-pharma-for-opposing-legal-marijuana/?sh=1c9b87091bac">have spent big money</a> defeating legalization measures, and they are likely to spend far more as it becomes increasingly clear that regulated cannabis is majorly <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/pharmaceutical-industry-suffers-billions-in-losses-after-states-legalize-marijuana-new-study-finds/">cutting into the market</a> for prescription painkillers.</p>
<p>But corporate interests aren’t just working to curtail legalization. They’re also angling to take over the marijuana market, once it goes fully legal.</p>
<p>Prominent drug policy activist Shaleen Title made this point <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/aacfd631?t=35m24s">on <em>Lever Time</em></a> this week. As she told me during a segment on Biden’s cannabis reform efforts, “If cannabis is in fact descheduled, that’s when you will see the big corporate interests like Amazon, Big Tobacco, Big Alcohol, and Big Pharma [come in], all of whom are waiting in the wings. And so that is not a process that we want to rush in any form.”</p>
<p>The groundwork for that corporate takeover is already being laid. Andrew Freedman, Colorado’s first marijuana czar, now runs <a href="https://www.cpear.org/">a policy group</a> dedicated to “establishing a responsible and equitable federal regulatory framework for cannabis in the United States” — which <a href="https://www.cpear.org/who-we-are/">is backed by funding from</a> the tobacco firm Altria and the beer corporations Molson Coors and Constellation Brands.</p>
<p>And does anyone really think Amazon is simply being altruistic in actively <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-is-supporting-the-effort-to-reform-the-nations-cannabis-policy">pushing to legalize marijuana</a>?</p>
<p>Maybe you think it doesn’t matter who is growing, processing, and distributing cannabis, as long as it is free of federal and state prohibition. But consider this: Do we really want marijuana controlled by the very companies that have made a science of maximizing addiction for profit, and that are crushing small business and labor all over the country and beyond?</p>

</div>
<p>Here’s the good news: Unlike many industries in this country, the takeover hasn’t succeeded yet. Federal and most state marijuana regulations have yet to be written, a nationwide market is still at least several years away. So it is still possible to hold accountable those who will be rewriting the rules on cannabis, to make sure that righting the country’s cannabis wrongs, as Biden put it, includes efforts that protect small farmers, medical marijuana patients, home-grow aficionados, mom-and-pop operators, rank-and-file workers, and the Black and Brown communities that suffered the worst from the country’s failed drug war.</p>
<p>As Title noted on our podcast, “As citizens, we don’t necessarily control how industries are going to roll out. But when it comes to this particular industry, those officials that want the credit of having legalized cannabis, they’re listening to people, and they’re especially listening to young people and consumers.”</p>
<p>Now, in other words, is the time to speak up. While Biden signaled he is taking steps to end the country’s “failed approach” to marijuana, it’ll be up to the broader public to properly launch a new one.</p>
