As you might suspect, both vehicles had been outfitted with some off-road equipment, including wheels, roof racks, and a rooftop tent. However, the 2009 and 2010 Cayennes both had over 80,000 miles on the odometer, so not many people would’ve trusted them in those types of conditions."

To tackle all that, including rough and unpaved roads, the two Porsches had at their disposal 290-horsepower and 273 lb.-ft. of torque via the 3.6-liter V6 engines. That doesn’t sound like much these days, and it isn’t, but that kind of power was sufficient for pulling the crossovers through tough conditions all the way to the finish."

It famously competed in the Trans-Syberia Rally which stretches from Berlin to Lake Baikal in Russia in 2006 and 2008. With over 6,200 miles of rugged terrain under its belt, Porsche’s crossover proved it can hang with the best in such conditions."
