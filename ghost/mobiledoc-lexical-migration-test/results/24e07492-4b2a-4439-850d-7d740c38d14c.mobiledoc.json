The idea is so that you can control the character with the left analogue stick but in this case, that function serves absolutely no purpose. Secondly, the cursor moves verrrrryyyy slowly, and there's no cursor settings in the Options menu, so you're stuck with this throughout the game's entirety. This was most frustrating when I entered the maze section and you're required to click where you want to go rather than being able to simply move, which is made all the more difficult when you're needing to strategically place shields and then quickly click away to avoid the enemies. Although, on the bright side, you can play the game entirely with a single Joy-Con, so that's kind of neat. What may have been a saving grace was that "

Some of the puzzles' tutorials can also be strangely obtuse, almost like it's deliberately only giving you half of the instructions. For example, when you're in the Music Room, you're presented with a diagram of circles, numbers and arrows which can be rotated, and your only two explanations are, \"Rotate the wheels and combine numbers to solve the targets\" and \"When a number is in the center, use the middle arrows to move it into a different circuit\". So all of that is fine but it doesn't explain clearly enough what my objective is. It took a lot of trial and error, which I found contradicts the game's intention to appeal to both children and adults."

If any developer is reading this, if you're going to have colour-based puzzles in your game, please, include a colour-blind mode! For those who aren't colour-blind and aren't aware of anyone who is, it's an easy thing to slip your mind, but whenever I come across colour-based puzzles, it just becomes a mindless process of moving items and flicking switches until something happens; either that or resorting to walkthroughs."
