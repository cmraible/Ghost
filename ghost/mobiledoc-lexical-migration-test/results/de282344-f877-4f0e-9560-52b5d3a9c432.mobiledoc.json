          "A new report from the other side of the pond features the shocking results of a recent poll. Classic car fans are opting out of planning a vacation this year and instead want to use the money to leverage themselves into a dream ride. This is apparently unexpected for those weird non-car people, but for car nuts it’s like reporting that water’s wet or gravity exists."

          "Planning a vacation right now can be a practice in frustration, thanks to the varying quarantine and social distancing practices in different regions and especially when going from one country to another. With the requirement to wear protective gear, stay away from others, and so forth, a nice getaway turns into just more stress, at least for some people. On the flip side, getting a classic car allows you to do something purely enjoyable as you drive around, enjoying your freedom."

Some people swear “staycations” where you act like a tourist in your own town is a budget-friendly way to “get away.” There are also day trips or you could go camping, especially if the classic you get is an off-roader."
