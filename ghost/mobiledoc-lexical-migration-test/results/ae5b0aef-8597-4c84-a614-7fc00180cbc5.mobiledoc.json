Sure, that's a lot but the issue is that it's twin-turbocharged and anyone who's ever really worked with that engine platform knows that it should be making a lot more with that setup. Perhaps the builder assumed the lower power would be best as the vehicle is quite light at just 2,700lbs but that would prove itself to be a bad assumption. That's because its competition weighs in at the exact same amount but makes a lot more power."

On the first race it was clear which car and driver was the fastest, that 318 took off like a rocket ship while the V8 was left spinning in the dust. Eventually, the 325 closed the gap a little in round two, but not by enough to win the race and prove that more power doesn't always mean a car will be faster. At the end of the day, the guys did a bonus race where the V8 won as it was racing from a roll as the 318 started from a dig, plus the V8 had the hit."
