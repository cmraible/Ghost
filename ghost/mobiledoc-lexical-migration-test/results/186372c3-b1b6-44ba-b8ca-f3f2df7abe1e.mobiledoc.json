          "John Ficarra, who used to own Creative Film Cars, has some wild stories of renting all sorts of cars to celebrities. When you cater to the stars who do all kinds of strange fashion shoots for magazines or music videos, they’re wanting some rare and bizarre vehicles. And while Ficarra no doubt made good money dealing with the odd requests and the prima donna attitudes which came along with many of the jobs, even more importantly he gathered many entertaining stories.

Some of the recruiting is done through clubs, so if there’s a club for the type of vehicle you own, that’s just another benefit of joining."

          "There’s also a weird story about a production company renting an M35 series 2 1/2-ton 6x6 military cargo truck. It was for a certain rock band who wanted to make a manly entrance at an awards show, but they had a trick for making themselves look “green” and it’s pretty cringey. How Ficarra didn’t burst out laughing at people when they revealed these cock and bull schemes is a testament to his professionalism. Funny enough, the scheme seemed to work with the “right” people."
