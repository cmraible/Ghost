    <p>Today I was fed a full commercial from Karlie Kloss, which was amazing because it was just a fully produced video ad like the ones you used to see on television when you used to watch live television.</p>

<p>And it is:</p>

<p>Yup, that‚Äôs a full-on TV advert. And it‚Äôs been commissioned and shot for play on <em>Instagram</em>.</p>
<p>It seems that social networks are becoming the new TV. And in that light the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-26/disney-said-to-be-working-with-adviser-on-potential-twitter-bid">latest ‚ÄúTwitter for sale‚Äù rumour</a> makes sense:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Walt Disney Co. is working with a financial adviser to evaluate a possible bid for Twitter Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="nowstreamingontwitter">Now streaming on Twitter</h2>
<p>Why? Because Twitter is quietly becoming a <em>video</em> company. <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/26/disney-twitter-bid/">Mathew Ingram</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>With its resources, Disney would be able to help Twitter improve its video streaming and possibly strike new deals with other content providers. As a result of a recent acquisition, Disney owns a stake in BAMTech, the digital arm of Major League Baseball, which runs streaming services for ESPN and others, including Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/09/26/disney-twitter-bloomberg">John Gruber put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Twitter is a media company and a publishing service, not a social network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Increasingly I wonder exactly what <em>is</em> a social network in 2016. Snapchat and WhatsApp are less social networks than communication tools. Instagram is a picture sharing service with comms element. Twitter is a publishing platform. Does that just leave Facebook?</p>
<p>Not everyone is certain about <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/9/26/13062276/disney-won-t-buy-twitter">Disney making a good partner for Twitter</a>, though:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But if you‚Äôre going to spend $18 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion on something, you need a little bit more than ‚ÄúI like the dude who runs the company.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bear in mind that Disney acquired Marvel AND Lucasfilm AND Pixar, for $15 billion. Is Twitter really worth as much to it as those three properties put together?</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
