That must have been quite the merry Christmas for the guy because this Chevelle packs a real punch with its 396 big block V8 and 4-speed manual with Hurst shifter."

But, like so many of us, he also must’ve been a chronic procrastinator because the car wasn’t finished until 2020. Apparently, the aim was to get the ol’ Chevelle into the same shape as it was described in Springsteen’s song “Racing in the Streets.”"

The lot listing does note that while a period radio is installed it’s not hooked up so you can’t just start jamming out immediately. That’s a small detail we doubt will affect the price much if at all, but it’s nice the seller included that. Speaking of price, interest in this Chevelle should be high, so the potential for some fierce bidding is very real."
