While a lot of bizarre things seem to happen in the Sunshine State, it shockingly wasn’t raining luxury SUVs from the sky. Instead, this was the result of a high-speed crash."

The Urus spun out of control, flipped, vaulted into the air, and landed on the edge of the house’s roof before finally coming to rest on the ground."

Fortunately, a man who was right there saw the person in the Italian SUV wasn’t getting out, so he pulled the driver to safety. That good Samaritan said the driver suddenly came to, said he was “good” and then ran off without his shoes on. That kind of response would make us suspect this was a stolen vehicle since the owner could be traced through the VIN."

Fortunately, nobody inside the duplex was hurt in the accident, but the building had to be vacated thanks to the damage."
