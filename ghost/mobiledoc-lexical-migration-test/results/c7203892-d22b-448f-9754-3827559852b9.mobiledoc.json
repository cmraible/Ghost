Many of us dream of modifying our cars to the point of being able to destroy even modern-day "

The face of passengers who don't know what's coming is priceless, with the car making a name for itself as the quote, “that loud scary car” it has become quite the local legend in its neck of the woods. Classic Mopar is cool, but a classic Mopar with modern-day NASCAR performance is something entirely different. This is one of the coolest muscle cars ever built and will continue to amaze thousands in the years to come."
