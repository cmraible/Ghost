<p>Back in June I did a presentation at the <a href="https://wpnyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress NYC</a> meet up on how to get the most out of your content analytics. The presentation runs about 30 minutes and at the end I took some questions from the audience. You can watch it below!</p>

<h2 class="mceTemp">Key points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We need to stop relying on the page view as the defacto standard of content performance.</li>
    <li>Start using clarity metrics not vanity metrics to determine success.</li>
    <li>Determining audience engagement is a multi-faceted problem and should be measured as such.</li>
    <li>Itâ€™s important to leverage tools such as custom reports to dive deeper into understanding your audience.</li>
    <li>Automated insights will continue to become more common among analytics services/tools.</li>
    <li>Data is not the devil and it should be viewed as a tool/benefit that can help grow and retain your audience.</li>
</ul>
