With CEO Akio Toyoda stepping down from his role and Lexus head Koji Sato stepping into his place, these same automotive outlets seem optimistic Toyota will finally be heading in the “right” direction, which of course involves the company doing what these automotive journalists think constitutes the future of personal mobility. They’ve made their disdain of Toyoda, who has been critical of the zombie-like march to electrification among automotive executives, quite open while at the same time claiming impartiality."

Keep in mind, it used to be partners with Tesla, which produced the first all-electric RAV-4, a fact so many seem to have conveniently forgotten. Almost overnight, Toyota ended that partnership and sold all interests in Tesla, an event journalists seem to have been unwilling to dig into, let alone talk about much. Did Toyota see something which spooked management? Why has it been hanging back on electrification after that turn in events?"

Whatever the case, I sincerely doubt Sato will pull a Ford and start pouring all R&D into electrification, so expect most automotive journalists to seethe and stay mad at Toyota for the foreseeable future."
