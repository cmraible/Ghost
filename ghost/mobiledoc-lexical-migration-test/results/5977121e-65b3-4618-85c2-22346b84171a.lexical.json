While we might think of the brand as one of luxury in modern times, performance was always the primary goal. Nowadays, there is but one car that truly exemplifies the road-legal race car spirit present with every vintage example. That automobile is the AG GT Black Series which combines a newer design with lots of power and handling performance. These things have made the GT an excellent performance vehicle with a lot to offer any amateur racer or sports car enthusiast.",

This powerhouse is capable of around 730 horsepower and some pretty hefty torque numbers compared to similarly specced European cars. Of course, this was not only achieved with natural aspiration, as that would be pretty much impossible. Instead, this vehicle utilizes a fantastic twin-turbocharging system for which Mercedes engineersâ€™ have virtually become famous in the performance automotive community.",
