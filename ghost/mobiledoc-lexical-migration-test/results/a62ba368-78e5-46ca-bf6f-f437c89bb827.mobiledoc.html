<hr>
<p>Yet another rare collector car has been snatched from a parking lot, this time a 2010 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-honda-civics/">Cadillac CTS-V</a> in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/10-classic-and-collector-cars-stolen/">Kansas City</a>, Kansas. The owner really want to get the vehicle back since it’s his pride and joy. He says the Caddie has tens of thousands in upgrades with it pushing over 800-horsepower, so it shouldn’t easily fly under the radar.</p>

<p>The owner started investigating the theft himself immediately and was able to obtain surveillance footage of where he parked it. That’s how he knows a Ford truck towed it away, which he was able to track to a house in Missouri where he found some of his belongings from the Cadillac.</p>
<p>Realizing he was hot on the trail, the guy called police who showed up and questioned a man, but didn’t arrest him.</p>
<p>Kansas City Kansas Police Chief Karl Oakman didn’t seem too pleased when a reporter asked him about this stolen car case and how the owner has been investigating it himself. “Do not take matters into your own hands,” he said. “We’ve seen so many incidents where people have done that and it hasn’t ended well.”</p>
<p>That kind of attitude angers many victims of car theft. They feel police do little to nothing to recover vehicles, placing those cases on the back burner.</p>
<p>There aren’t that many 2010 CTS-V in existence anyway, but this one should really stick out. It’s possible the car has been parted out by now or is in another part of the country, so we’re relying on our readers who are constantly looking at these types of performance vehicles to stay on alert. Whoever took it is likely trying to get rid of it, whole or in pieces so if you see anything suspicious contact Kansas City Kansas Police at 913-596-3000.</p>
