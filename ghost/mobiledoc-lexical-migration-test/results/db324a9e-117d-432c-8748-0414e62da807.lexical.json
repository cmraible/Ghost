Rear-wheel drive, plus an independent double wishbone front suspension combined with a 5-link rear suspension added to the fun. While it wasn’t going to win many drag races, the whole point of the Crossfire was to be nimble and spirited, making it a blast to drive on backroads with plenty of twists and turns.
