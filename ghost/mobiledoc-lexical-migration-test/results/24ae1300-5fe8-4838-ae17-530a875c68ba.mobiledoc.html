<p>Having a gorgeous, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2020-corvette-z51-win/">head-turning car</a> can be a lot of fun, especially if you revel in the kind of attention it brings. This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/pro-touring-1967-chevelle/">Pro-Touring Chevelle</a> is just such a ride, thanks to the aggressive modifications to the exterior, like the wild custom front splitter and those cool 18-inch CCW Classic wheels tucked nicely into the wells. That combined with the nice blue exterior, intricate pinstriping on the hood, and dual front fender hash marks like what you see on some of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1963-corvette-grand-sport-lingenfelter/">Corvette Grand Sports</a> makes for quite the statement.

<p>While it’s true that modern <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/trucks/">pickup trucks</a> have just grown bigger over the years, you could say the same thing about cars. We could have a discussion about how modern safety equipment and luxuries everyone these days thinks they can’t do without have contributed to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1967-cadillac-sixty-special-norwegian-king/">portliness of vehicles today</a>, but that’s another discussion for another time.
