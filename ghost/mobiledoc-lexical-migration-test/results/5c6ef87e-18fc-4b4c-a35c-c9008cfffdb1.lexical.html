<p>My daughters first saw <em>Encanto</em> with the Brownies and Rainbows back in the tail end of 2021, and so this household has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWRMAU6V-c">not talking about Bruno</a> (no, no, no) before it was cool. </p>
<p>What we <em>do</em> talk about is the new subscribers here, thanks to <em>OM&HB's </em>prominent place in journalism.co.uk's <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/50-blogs-by-journalists-for-journalists/s2/a551846/">list of blogs by journalists, for journalists</a>. Hello, welcome aboard — and please do drop me a line to introduce yourself!</p>
<p>For newcomers <em>tl;dr </em>is a weekly-ish dump of links that might be useful to people in audience engagement, engaged journalism or social media roles. It's an eclectic selection of what I think is useful — and some of the links may be weeks old. It just depends on how much time I've had to catch up on my reading.</p>
<p>I hope, as ever, that you find them useful…</p>

<h2 id="the-big-read-the-fall-of-politics-for-all">The Big Read: The Fall of Politics For All</h2>
<p>Perhaps it's something about the people who I choose to follow on Twitter, but I laregly missed the Politics For All phenomenon. It was a popular Twitter account that tweeted out politics stories, with a sensational first tweet, and a link to the original story in the second tweet of the short thread. </p>
<p>That was, most likely, to work around Twitter's new habit of down-ranking tweets with links in them, but it led to accusations that the account was basically stealing attention from the reporters who did the work in the first place.</p>
<p>But it was incredibly popular in the interesection of journalism and politics Twitter, in the UK in particular. And then, one day Twitter killed the account. Here's what happened:</p>
