<hr>
<p>Coming into the “golden era” of the SCCAs Trans-American Championship racing series, auto manufacturers and racers alike went to great extents to dominate the track. Pontiac was no exception. Going as far as to create a new engine that complied with the SCCA's 5.0-liter or less guideline for use in a specially optioned Firebird bearing the name of the series itself, Pontiacs efforts unfortunately did not pay off in the race series. However, for enthusiasts that longed for a Firebird with more power, better handling, and unmistakable style, Pontiac struck gold creating the American icon known as the Firebird Ram Air III. <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/33377/1969-pontiac-firebird-ram-air-iii">Examples like this</a> 1969 from GAA Classic Car Auctions is a great car from the era.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/33377/1969-pontiac-firebird-ram-air-iii">This car</a> has been preserved very well and has been repainted in the correct Cameo White with blue strips and rear panel. The interior appears to be original rather than redone and will take you back in time with the working original radio. Under the dual Ram Air hood sits the original matching numbers Pontiac 400 cid Ram Air III backed by a 4-speed manual transmission. This is no ordinary 1969 Firebird, it's PHS documented as one of only 499 in this configuration.</p>
