<p>Look at this beautiful 1966, numbers matching, true survivor! From the front with the patina hood and the stark white grille, to the new wood railed bed with the bright white bumper, it is as solid as the day it rolled off the showroom floor. Powered by 283 cubic-inch engine, it's riding on new 16" wheels and tires, and has an unmistakable rumble of the dual exhaust - it also has only 39,000 original documented miles.</p>

<p>This is a professionally built custom truck with fewer than 500 road miles on the fresh build. She is a fair weather-driven, show quality truck, capable of wowing people at the next Cars and Coffee or comfortably taking on the Hot Rod Power Tour Long Haul.</p>
