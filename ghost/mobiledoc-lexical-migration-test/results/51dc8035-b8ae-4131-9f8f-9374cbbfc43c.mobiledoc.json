It’s a heartbreaking situation we honestly don’t completely understand. A lot of times if you talk to the owner they’re not too friendly about inquiries since they’re supposedly “just about” to start fixing the car(s) up, even if they haven’t touched a single bolt in decades. That’s kind of like this story we bring to you today about a 1968 Plymouth Valiant which sat for 40 years and was rescued."

If you happen to just love Valiants that’s great, but your average person on the street probably either wouldn’t know what one is or would turn up their nose about owning one. In other words, this is in our opinion and underappreciated car."

This sort of car YouTube video has become popular in the past while, maybe in part because everyone knows it’s overall not a great idea. In other words, we don’t endorse doing this sort of thing, but it sure is entertaining to watch someone else take all those risks."
