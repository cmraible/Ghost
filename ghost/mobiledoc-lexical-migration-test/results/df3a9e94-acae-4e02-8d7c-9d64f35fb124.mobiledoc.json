        "html": "<p>Consumers and members of the technology press alike regularly point to the iPad as a device that offers a big package in a relatively thin body. At 9.4 mm thick, Apple&#8217;s tablet is certainly worthy of that praise. The iPad isn&#8217;t the thinnest large-screen tablet, however. That honor currently belongs to Toshiba&#8217;s Excite 10 LE tablet (7.62 mm) but is about to be stripped away by Sony&#8217;s newest tablet, the Xperia Tablet Z, which comes in at a ridiculous 6.9 mm of thickness.</p>\n<p>Simply whittling down a tablet to achieve such a thin profile seems impressive enough, but the Xperia Tablet Z also packs hardware inside that could deliver quite a punch and give other tablets a run for their money.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The Xperia Tablet Z will come running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. It&#8217;s not the absolute latest version of Jelly Bean (4.2 is running on the Nexus family of tablets), but it&#8217;s certainly usable. Inside, the Z is powered by aÂ Qualcomm 1.5GHz quad-core APQ8064 processor, which should offer plenty of horsepower, and 2 GB of ram, which is about 1 GB more than you&#8217;ll likely find in many other tablets on the market. The screen boasts a resolution of 1920 by 1200 for a pixels-per-inch count of 226, which isn&#8217;t quite up to par with the iPad&#8217;s Retina display at 264, but will still look a lot better than most other comparably-sized Android tablets.</p>\n<p>A few other features you&#8217;ll find on the device include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px\">32 GB of flash storage</span></li>\n<li>8.1 megapixel camera</li>\n<li>LTE capability</li>\n<li>NFC radio</li>\n<li>MicroSD slot for expandable memory</li>\n<li>S-Force virtual surround sound</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find all of this crammed into a device that is not only super-thin, but only weighs a hair under 1.1 lbs, which makes the Xperia Tablet Z not only the thinnest 10-incher on the market, but also the lightest.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no word on pricing yet, but I&#8217;m guessing it falls somewhere in between $349 and $449, as it has to compete with both the iPad with Retina on the high end as well as the Nexus 10 (a fantastic piece of hardware in its own right) at $399. Sony also made no mention of when we might be expecting to see the Tablet Z, but since the cat is already out of the bag on the device&#8217;s specs, I&#8217;d expect to see it relatively soon.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the Xperia Tablet Z?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
