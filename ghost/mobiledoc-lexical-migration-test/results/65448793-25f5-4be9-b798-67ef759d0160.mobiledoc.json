          "For the second-gen Bel Air, GM gave the car a grille inspired by  Ferrari, chrome headliner bands for hardtops, stainless steel window  openings, and chrome fender spears as well as other design cues carried  over from the first generation. Clad in a brilliant candy orange with a  contrasting white two-tone on the roof, this Bel Air wagon restomod  could not be in better shape. Plenty of beautiful chrome accents make  the orange paint stand out even more including a chrome front grile,  front and rear bumpers, hood ornament, and side mirrors complete with  LED turn signals. This two-door wagon features a rear tailgate and  liftgate split. The headlights and taillights are in excellent condition  as well as the glass with high-quality pre-cut tint. A set of chrome  18-inch American Racing Torque Thrust II wheels sit on all four corners.  According to the listing, the car only has 6,049 miles on this setup."

          "The heart of this restomod beats through a LS1 5.7-liter V8 engine  mated to a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. The car is equipped  with a Billet Tru Trac accessory drive, polished alternator, chrome air  conditioning compressor, and an aluminum radiator. A dual exhaust adds  to the rumble of the modern engine as well as providing a bit more  oomph. Custom LS3 engine covers add more pizazz under the  hood. Maneuvering is made easy thanks to power rack and pinion steering,  and bringing everything to a halt are power disc brakes up front and  drums out back. Custom springs give this wagon that perfect stance."

          "Open the doors to a luxurious and attractive cream-colored leather  interior with a front split bench seat up front and a one-piece rear  bench spanning the rear. A 1957 gauge cluster is embedded behind a '61  Impala steering wheel mounted to a tilt steering column. Keeping the  cabin cool and comfortable is air conditioning from Vintage Air with  registers integrated into the dashboard. High-quality plush carpeting  installed throughout the cabin and trunk area certainly adds to the feel  of luxury. A custom console includes audio with a Pioneer Bluetooth  touch screen and stainless steel cup holders. Other interior highlights  include a console-mounted Lokar shifter, billet dash trim, stainless  steel sill covers, matching sun visors, seat belts for four, and manual  windows, locks, and mirror."
