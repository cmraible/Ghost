          ", the Bulldog uses a 1972 K50 and adds a staggering amount of customized parts, from the bumpers to the roll cage and even the ochre and white paint. A 12-valve Cummins engine with Dynamite Diesel Stage II injectors, plus big 40-inch Toyota Open Country M/T tires make for pretty much an unstoppable combination. While the Bulldog is a one-off build, you could probably convince Rtech to make another, with the right amount of persuasion."

With a Chevy 350ci V8, power steering, and power brakes it’s definitely a restomod. Also keeping the looks vintage is the 1967-1972 GM Crew Cab, which as the name suggests uses either a GMC or Chevy truck, transforming it into a true crew cab. For those who really want a luxurious ride for backseat passengers, there’s a Texas Longhorn option which bumps up legroom another 7 inches."
