<h2 id="heckuva-job-pete">Heckuva Job, Pete</h2>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/andrew-perez/">Andrew Perez</a></p>
<p>As the Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg’s job is to oversee the U.S. transportation system, including as the nation’s top airline regulator. He was selected for the job not because of his experience, but because he ran for president and is seen as a future candidate for higher office.</p>
<p>As a result, all scrutiny of Buttigieg’s increasingly disastrous record as the nation’s transportation czar is now being treated in Washington as an attack on a political rival — and Democratic consultants who might want a role on a future Buttigieg campaign are stepping up to lavish praise on the guy.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>The episode underscores precisely why key regulatory roles should not be doled out as political gifts: By selecting a former small city mayor with national ambitions and no relevant experience to lead the nation’s transportation department, President Joe Biden set up the department for failure — while effectively insulating his appointee from criticism.</p>

<p>As we’ve documented at <em>The Lever,</em> Democratic lawmakers and state officials from both parties were <a href="__GHOST_URL__/state-officials-warned-buttigieg-about-airline-mess/">begging Buttigieg to crack down</a> on the airline industry months before the Southwest Airlines debacle, in which thousands of flights were canceled over the holiday season because the company had failed to upgrade its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/12/28/southwest-airlines-flight-cancellations/">antiquated computer systems</a>.</p>
<p>As William McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamJMcGee/status/1608736623507951617?s=20&t=dUfCFw4SS7unoUUBL43y0g">wrote</a>: “Southwest was inevitable after [Buttigieg] failed to punish awful behavior all year.”</p>
<p>Throughout last year, airlines were criticized for repeatedly selling tickets for flights for which they didn’t have enough staff, then canceling the flights at the last minute.</p>
<p>One of the lawmakers calling on Buttigieg to act was Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who wrote a <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-khanna-joins-senator-sanders-calling-secretary-buttigieg-hold-airlines">letter</a> last June imploring the transportation secretary to “consider utilizing every tool available to minimize mass cancellations and flight delays.”</p>
<p>Yet, Khanna’s criticisms of Buttigieg are now being perceived as an attempt to “draw contrasts” with a potential 2024 presidential rival, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/12/ro-khanna-says-hes-looking-at-the-senate-his-allies-are-talking-about-the-white-house-00077672"><em>Politico</em></a>. Democratic consultants used the opportunity to pitch their future services to Buttigieg.</p>
<p>“Buttigieg literally was way ahead of the curve on this — months and months and months ahead of the curve, and to most consumers, Pete Buttigieg is a fucking hero,” said John Anzalone, a pollster for President Joe Biden’s campaign.</p>
<p>Anzalone’s quote brought back memories of former President George W. Bush telling Michael Brown, the disgraced one-time administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that he was doing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/political-bookworm/post/heck-of-a-job-brownie-spreads-the-katrina-blame-in-new-book/2011/06/13/AGgFebUH_blog.html">“a heckuva job”</a> in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which left <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/95/3/bams-d-12-00074.1.xml">at least 1,100</a> dead.</p>
<p><em>Axios</em> released its own <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/buttigieg-faa-transportation-crises">piece</a> fretting that Buttigieg’s “modest Cabinet role has become a political albatross for one of the Democratic Party's brightest young stars.”</p>
<p>There, Jill Zuckman, a partner at the Biden campaign consulting firm SKDK, said that Republicans are criticizing Buttigieg now simply because he could run for president. “That’s not how past Transportation secretaries were treated,” she said.</p>

<p>In a more rational world, when a political appointee with limited experience is chosen as the nation’s top transportation regulator and the system he oversees experiences a series of unprecedented crises, it might be expected that appointee would face some criticism in Washington.</p>
<p>But Buttigieg isn’t a normal regulator. He might run for Senate or even president again one day. So reporters and lawmakers doing their jobs and applying scrutiny will be portrayed as launching unfair political attacks on a man who, Democratic consultants will tell you, is doing a heckuva job.</p>
<p>That may not be a recipe for good governance or a functioning transportation system — but politics take precedence.</p>
