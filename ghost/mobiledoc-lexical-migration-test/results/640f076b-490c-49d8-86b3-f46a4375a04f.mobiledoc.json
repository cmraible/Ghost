          " game mode has remained largely unchanged, and it is very accessible. Essentially, there are only four buttons. Two of them are the centre of the drum, making a DON sound; two of them are at the edge of the drum, making a KA sound. Most notes will be either DON or KA, with some notes needing you to hit both DON buttons, or both KA buttons respectively. Other than that, you will see drumroll notes, which ask you to just mash any of the buttons as fast as you can. The controller uses all of its buttons, but they all function in one of these two ways.

This gives a lot of options to keep you coming back. My personal favourite is the Great Toy War, a one vs. one game mode where the better you perform at a song, the more you sabotage your enemy to make it harder for them to perform. Another wonderful feature in the side content is a practice mode. Here, the songs are broken up into equal chunks, and when you play through the song, you are graded in each section so the game can tell you what you need to improve on. You can also select a specific section of the song to practice in order to help you get over the humps that get you down when playing the song properly. This is a wonderful addition to a rhythm game, and one that I personally think should become an industry standard."

          ". The game has a number of control schemes to use, one of them being motion controls. On face value, they are executed well, although there is a learning curve to timing when you use it; however, my complaint with them is how they affect gameplay. The motion controls do not differentiate between the two types of notes. Swinging the joycon like a drumstick will hit a note regardless of what the note is. I feel that this introduces a level of ease into the game that shouldn’t be there because it essentially makes a four button game (two DONS and two KAs) a two button game (Left swing and Right swing). In theory, if you’re fast enough, you could only swing one Joy-Con for every note except for the ones that require you to hit two DONs or KAs at once. A bit of a nitpick, but I did notice personally a marked increase in score when I used the motion controls over the button controls. "

This full list is just a tap of the shoulder button away on the base games song list, where one could be tempted by a very long list of songs.

This game is very colourful, very bright, very happy, and very busy. So much so that I could easily see people being alienated from the game that do not like that aesthetic. No dialogue in the game is in any language but Japanese. Like I said, this isn’t a knock on the game, however I will admit that I would have LOVED this game when I was in high school, when I thought anime was the upper echelon of media, and I mistakenly (some might say racistly) idolised a false sense of Japanese culture based off of what anime portrayed."

          " is the purest idea of a rhythm game in my mind. It’s fun, fast-paced, and packed with a wide selection of wonderful music. While the majority of the content on offer is behind a monthly fee when you already pay close to full game price for it, 76 songs at base is still a long list of music to play through. The game is pure fun, unapologetically Japanese, and an all around great time for fans of rhythm games. It also introduces the two things that Ludwig Von Beethoven foolishly left out of his most famous work, dancing mascots and taiko drums."
