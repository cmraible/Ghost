          "The bonding power of a car is undeniable. Be it father and son, husband and wife, or between siblings. Brothers JJ and Pierre Petersen have always been best friends, and gearheads - what a great combination! These brothers also learned the importance of sharing early on, so they decided that instead of having one car a piece, they’d share a car so they could get something they really wanted. Skeptics of the agreement between the brothers thought the arrangement would cause conflict or tension between them, but it’s only strengthened their bond."

They were extremely excited about the process of learning about the car and finding out more about the niche in general. The duo is from parents who immigrated here from Europe, so they weren’t as immersed in car culture as first generation citizens."

They remember this trip, not because it was a relaxing and easygoing time, but because it was actually quite trying. They offer that they experienced nearly every type of driving condition - hail, snow, thunderstorms - and they just bunkered down and kept push through it."
