<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/tags/tldr/">tl;dr</a> was very popular when I started it back in the early part of the year. Then events rather overtook me, and it dropped off my agenda. Well, now it’s back, should be weekly — and with <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/newsletter-clicks/">Ghost’s new analytics</a>, it should be a really useful source of information about what my audience really carer about — while also being useful to you.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a tab-dump issue. There are stories here going back over the last few months — but doing that has drawn out some interesting narratives, not least that Meta’s Facebook and Instagram are clearly losing their way. We’ll get to that towards the end, but for now — enjoy these links. Hopefully, there should be something here for everyone. If not, I recommend whisky and <em>She-Hulk…</em></p>

    <li>🆕 Back in July, Instagram announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/instagram-test-full-screen-video-home-feed/">a big overhaul of its UI</a>.</li>
    <li>↩️ <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-instagram-walks-back-its-changes">Wait, maybe not.</a> — this is rare for Meta. Normally, they push forward with changes even if people dislike them. Are they losing sight of what their users will actually tolerate?</li>

</ul>
<p>Based on the links above, Meta’s future is looking more uncertain than I can ever recall. As <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/instagram-walkback/">Nick Heer puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>But look at the past few weeks of Meta news and it seems like the company has zero idea of what to do or why people use its products. It made drastic unlikable changes to Instagram; its leadership is panicking over TikTok; its latest public demonstration of its metaverse future is embarrassing and its educational value is less justified than the VR headset in a thirty year old Simpsons clip. Do these decisions look like the product of a focused company that has near-term goals for its future and innovative ideas beyond that?</blockquote>

I don’t know if that might ever come to pass, but for now, we can take back the internet by going back to creating our own websites and blogs and even newsletters and relying less, far less, on the cursed social networks.</blockquote>

<p>Journalists love news. It's axomiatic, really. But our readers don't tend to love news as much as us. Our obsession with chronicling every detail of the rolling waves of crises over the past five or six years initially helped drive sales up — but is now becoming a problem.</p>
