The body and paint look incredible on this truck, and the lowered stance is perfect with those five-spoke chrome wheels and wide running boards. The interior is a little more restratined with a conventional bench seat, but the iconic blue hue blends in wonderfully and aftermarket gauges add a modernized touch."

This engine is matched with an automatic transmission that sends power to the rear tires through a nine-inch rear end, and the addition of power steering, power brakes and air conditioning mean this truck is one serious cruiser."
