For the cop, it’s also a stressful situation because it’s one of the most dangerous things they can do. That was clearly illustrated when 38-year-old Delaware resident Milton Jermaine Lewis dragged a Virginia State Police trooper for three miles."

After the trooper pulled over Lewis’ 2021 Mazda CX-30, the trooper wisely approached the passenger side so he wouldn’t be hit by other drivers. Little did he know he was about to go on a wild ride."

Probably panicking because he knew he’d really stepped in it, Lewis pushed the little Mazda grocery getter to 115 mph as he drug the trooper for three miles."

Police discovered a handgun in the Mazda. Thankfully Lewis didn’t pull that out during the altercation or the trooper might not have survived. Still, he’s facing a long list of charges including reckless driving by speeding, felony eluding of a police officer, having a concealed weapon, altering a serial number on a firearm, felony assault of a law enforcement officer, abduction, attempted capital murder, failure to maintain control of a vehicle, no seatbelt, felony hit and run."
