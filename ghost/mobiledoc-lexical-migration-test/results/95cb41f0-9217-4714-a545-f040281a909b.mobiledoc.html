One company aimed to fix that oversight by converting a handful of cars into droptops.</h3>

<p>The 2014 Dodge Viper you see here is finished off so well, that you might have a hard time believing that it's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/shelby-project-returns/">not factory stock</a>. When we first saw it, we were scrambling to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-class-69/">try to figure out</a> if there was a fifth generation Viper <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1996-corvette-grand-sport-convertible/">convertible</a> that we didn't know about.</p>

<p>That's a simple question with a complicated answer. No, there wasn't a factory Dodge Viper convertible in 2014. However, where there's a will, there's a way. If you have enough money and know the right people, anything is possible.</p>
<p>The right people, in this case, are Prefix Detroit. Back in 2014, they built a grand total of ten Dodge Viper convertibles, dubbed "Medusa." We're sure that the Gorgon namesake would love feeling the wind through her, uh, <em>snakes</em> with the top down.</p>

<p>Unlike the mythical creature, though, looking at this Medusa won't turn you to stone. Either way, though, laying your eyes on it will stop you dead in your tracks.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, the Medusa conversion process took eight weeks and cost $35,000. For roughly the price of a Mustang GT convertible, you could have had someone chop the roof off of your new Viper.</p>

<p>From the look of things, it was worth it. This Viper, currently located at <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/209369/2014-dodge-viper-medusa">GR Auto Gallery</a>, has covered just 2,783 miles since new. The asking price is$159,900. With so few around, we have nothing to really compare it to.</p>
<p>Our suggestion? Act fast â€“ we don't have too many days of convertible weather left.</p>
