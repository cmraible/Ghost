<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/resurrecting-1972-chevelle/">The Chevelle</a> is an automotive icon. Whether it be from the incredible stunts depicted in movies such as Jack Reacher or The Barefoot executive. Or from just a couple of old guys reminiscing on the fun they might have had in the car. There is no doubt that the 2nd generation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1971-chevelle-ss-packs-a-454/">Chevelle</a> will live on in history as one of America’s greatest muscle cars. In recent years the Chevelle has become most famous for its use in an unthinkably large number of resto-mod builds. Of course, no other car quite fits the idea of classic muscle car styling combined with a touch of the modern better than the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/1972-chevrolet-chevelle/">1972 Chevelle</a>. This car is a perfect example of that, a beautiful 1972 black and silver Chevelle.</p>
<p>Under the hood sits an LS3 V8 engine with ported heads, a BTR stage-four cam, MSD two-step, and line lock. All of that motor is producing a healthy +500 horsepower which is transferred through a six-speed manual transmission. Handling is improved via the use of a full tubular BMR suspension system with Bilstein shocks for the front and rear of the car. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-corvair-with-c8-engine/">Braking is controlled</a> by Wilwood's six-piston brakes in the front and four-piston brakes in the rear.  </p>
<p>As this beautiful black beast rolls around, on top of a set of custom three-piece wheels, you'll always hear this thing before you see it. Those Hooker Blackheart headers give the car a sound to match those fantastic looks. Ripping incredible burnouts and pulling extreme acceleration is extremely easy in this car due to the wicked power and point, suspension setup. All in all, this is simply an amazing car. Without much effort, the car can turn heads wherever it goes. This is likely due to a combination of factors ranging from the fact that the Chevelle is one of America’s respected muscle cars to its extremely high build quality. Either way, this is one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-baddest-chevelles/">coolest Chevelle</a> we’ve ever seen and the builder should be commended for his work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1LzS0m9EFg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
