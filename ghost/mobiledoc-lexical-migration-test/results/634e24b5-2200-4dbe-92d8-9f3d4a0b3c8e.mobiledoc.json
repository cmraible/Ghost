          ", this one is a flawless example of a factory fresh car... it even comes with its original purchase invoice from 1968! What makes this Camaro even cooler is that it's beautifully painted in a color called Cordovan Maroon, which you don't see very often. Complementing the dark red color is lots of flawless chrome and factory rallye wheels. The interior is equally exquisite with the factory correct bucket seats and original AM stereo, and everything is as clean as the day this car was made."

The listing says that this Camaro is \"almost all original,\" but it's hard to spot anything that isn't at least period correct on this classic as even the suspension has been cleaned, detailed and painted to preserve the originality and beauty. The biggest reason why this Camaro remains such a time capsule is that the odometer is showing just under 75,000 miles."
