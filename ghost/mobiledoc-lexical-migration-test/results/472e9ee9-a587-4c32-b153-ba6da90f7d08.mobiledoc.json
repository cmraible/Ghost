While for many it was fondly remembered for its standing as the last pickup made by Jeep, others have fond memories of its simplistic, utilitarian design. The video of a review of the Jeep Comanche from 1986 is attached to this article, helping you to see the truck back in its glory days."

Instead, the MJ was based off the XJ and featured a unique unibody chassis. Buyers could order it with either a 6- or 7-foot bed, depending on the model year and trim level."

          "If you’ve seen the new Jeep Gladiator in person by now, and most of your have, you know they’re not exactly small. Some people love the feeling and look of driving a big pickup, even if the Gladiator is still dwarfed by the full-size trucks on the market. But try parking one or maneuvering through a tight area and you might not be such a fan anymore. These little pickups from yesteryear are great for many reasons, which is why it’s too bad they haven’t made a comeback today."
