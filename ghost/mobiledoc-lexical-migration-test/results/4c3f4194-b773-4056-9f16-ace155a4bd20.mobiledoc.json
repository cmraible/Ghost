This Silverado pickup has been lowered with a 5/7-inch drop and sits mean on 22-inch wheels.

The cabin features custom red leather, a touch-screen double DIN dash with Apple Car Play, Escalade gauges, ice-cold air conditioning, power windows, and power locks.  What’s more, this pickup comes equipped with an alarm system and remote start for those super cold winter months or hot and sticky summer months. No matter the season, you’ll enter this Silverado in a comfortable manner."

          " is another work of art. It’s in excellent condition, clean, and tidy. The heart and soul of this truck is a 5.3-liter engine with forged internals and Texas Speed Stage 4 cams. The full motor was professionally built by a highly reputable performance shop. It’s mated to a built 4L80E transmission with a 3,200 rpm stall converter. If that wasn’t enough, this show-quality truck also received an LSA supercharger. That powerhouse combination results in a whopping 597 rwhp. This truck was professionally tuned as well and is ready to go."
