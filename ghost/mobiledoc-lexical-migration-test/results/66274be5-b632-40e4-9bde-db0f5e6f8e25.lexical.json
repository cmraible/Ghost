You probably did hear about GM moving its lead Corvette engineers to the electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle programs, a move which angered quite a few enthusiasts. Also part of the changes, Mark Kent has been moved from his position as Director of Motorsports Competition Engineering and is now working on the GM Defense program. All is not lost, because the man occupying the director position is Mark Stielow, a name Camaro fans might know.",
