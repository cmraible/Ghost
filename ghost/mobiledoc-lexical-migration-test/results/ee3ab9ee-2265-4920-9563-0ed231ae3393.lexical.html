<p>Sorry for the blog silence, but I’ve been off the grid for much of the past couple of weeks, first at my broadband-free brother’s place, and then in the depths of Devon, where I didn’t even have mobile phone reception, let alone internet access. Pictures from the latter adventure are steadily being uploaded to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adders/sets/72157594457430136/">this set</a> on Flickr.</p>
<p>After all the fuss and horror over Le Web 3, it was nice to get away from the internet and even blogs for a while. But now, I’m back and raring to go.</p>
<p>Expect heavy blogging ahead�</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
