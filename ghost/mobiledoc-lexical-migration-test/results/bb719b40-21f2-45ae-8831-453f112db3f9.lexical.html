<p>Ahead of the auction in Scottsdale, Arizona next month, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/barrett-jackson-50" rel="nofollow">Barrett-Jackson</a> has announced it has added <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Toyota" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Lexus" rel="nofollow">Lexus</a> to its list of official manufacturing partners. Those two venerable <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">car</a> brands join the likes of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Dodge" rel="nofollow">Dodge</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> in the Sponsor Pavilion. This arrangement is set to last through 2022, with the possibility it will continue past then.</p>
<p>As sponsors, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/toyota-warns-about-rushing-electrification/">Toyota</a> and Lexus have signed on for four auctions held each year. They will get display spaces at each, allowing them to show off their latest production vehicles like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Toyota/Supra" rel="nofollow">Toyota Supra</a> and Lexus RC 350 F Sport. They’ll also be able to show off heritage models, such as the ever-popular Toyota Celica and MR2, plus special development vehicles.</p>
<p>This also means Toyota and Lexus cars will be present at the Barrett-Jackson Performance Track. That means auction attendees could experience the performance chops of different models for themselves, helping to build more respect for the brand.</p>

<p>Lexus will enjoy its own role at auctions. At Scottsdale, the brand will be the presenting Sponsor of the Scottsdale 2020 Opening Gala Night. It will also have luxury vehicles on display at the Sponsorship Pavilion.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to have Toyota and Lexus join the Barrett-Jackson family as official manufacturer sponsors through 2022,” said Craig Jackson chairman and CEO of Barrett-Jackson. “Our relationship with Toyota started at the 2019 Scottsdale Auction where we sold the first production 2020 Toyota Supra VIN 001 for $2.1 million benefiting the American Heart Association and the Bob Woodruff Foundation. Giving back to those in need is integral to Toyota, Lexus and Barrett-Jackson, each raising millions of dollars each year for charities around the world.”</p>
<p>While the other three existing manufacturing partners have an international reach, Toyota will help Barrett-Jackson will help increasing the company’s global influence. It’s also a chance for the automaker to connect better with automotive enthusiasts, something it admittedly hasn’t always executed perfectly on.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Toyota sold the very first 2020 GR Supra through Barrett-Jackson. It seems that helped to spark this new arrangement.</p>
