<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-pace-car-history/">Pace cars</a> have been around since the early 1900s, offering a few functions in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/set-the-pace-with-this-indy-500-c5-corvette/">Indy 500</a> - kicking off a race, leading warm-up laps, and assisting with yellow flag cautions. They were thought up as a way to give a race a rolling start, and became a sensational part of the sport, and auto manufacturers discovered that using a pace car as a promotional model was a great marketing tactic. To celebrate this tradition, we dug into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/coolest-cars-middle-june/">Motorious inventory</a> to find our favorite pace cars for sale.</p>
