<p>Many years ago, <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2011-bmw-1m/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=march3">BMW decided</a> to take on the challenge of building race cars that would be available for sale to the general public. This idea birthed the M-Series, the M stands for motorsport and <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2011-bmw-1m/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=march3">M-Series cars</a> are typically the highest performers in the BMW lineup. The 3 Series has become the poster child for the M-Series cars, however, the 1-series is another amazing choice for the M treatment taking the already incredible sports coupe and transforming it into a high-performance German designed race-inspired vehicle.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the E82 is widely regarded as one of the most sought-after M models due to the limited production numbers in the US as well as the reputation for the M series car's affinity towards performance. This distinction has resulted in high scarcity and extreme value inflation, luckily we decided to share this <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2011-bmw-1m/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=march3">2011 BMW E82 1-Series M</a> Coupe up for auction at <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2011-bmw-1m/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=march3">PCarMarket.</a></p>

<p>To say that the specific car that we are speaking of today is rare would be an extreme understatement.
