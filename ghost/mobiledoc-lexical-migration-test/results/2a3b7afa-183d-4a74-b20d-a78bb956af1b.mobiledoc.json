          "Being a car enthusiast can be expensive but being one in Manhattan is just ridiculously expensive. Yet comedian Jerry Seinfeld pulls it off with style, thanks to his mountains of cash and willingness to pay $1.4 million for an underground garage where he keeps all his wonderful toys. And what a collection he has with about 150 cars worth up to an estimated $150,000,000."

He’s also been a big proponent of the Acura NSX, even going so far as to star in a Super Bowl commercial to promote the Japanese supercar."

Car enthusiasts might already be shaking their head yes, because quite a few view Lexus in a less-than-favorable light. Seinfeld said that the Japanese luxury brand owned by Toyota “perfected the idea of a coffin on wheels.” He expressed his views on Lexus while shooting "

After all, Lexus has made some tremendous performance machines in the past, like the Lexus LFA, another Japanese supercar many fantasize about owning. Apparently, it’s a “coffin on wheels” or at least Seinfeld hasn’t said it’s an exception to his view of the brand."
