As always, the process through which Foose goes about altering the Aztek's design is interesting to watch, and it shows how just minor details can affect the overall look of a vehicle. In the beginning of his sketch process, Foose gave the Aztek a raked roof and low stance resulting in a street rod-like appearance, which would have been a cool spin for him to put on this design."
