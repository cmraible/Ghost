Harley Earl was tasked with creating a new car that would bridge the gaps between the brands, and was appointed the head of design for the new project."

The car has gone through only two owners in its lifetime and currently sits in the hands of a collector who has restored it beyond its original glory and taken the car to a whole new level. All of the internals have either been repaired or replaced and it still sports the original 353 cubic-inch V8 that still runs great."
