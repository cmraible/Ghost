<p>Big events continue to happen on the Starbucks Workers United front. On Tuesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/greenhousenyt/status/1516526902810394632?s=20&t=yaIAIIqDo_omyHfqWhSlYg">five Starbucks stores</a> in greater Richmond, Virginia, voted to unionize. <a href="https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2022/04/workers-at-starbucks-roastery-second-in-seattle-and-on-capitol-hill-to-unionize/">On Thursday</a>, they won an election at the 100-employee-plus Starbucks Reserve Roastery flagship store in Seattle — one of the largest Starbucks stores to organize so far. Then, on Friday, the shamefully<a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/congress-should-boost-nlrb-funding-to-protect-workers-well-being/"> underfunded</a> National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1517572649630769158/photo/1">issued</a> a complaint over Starbucks’ <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/local/memphis-starbucks-workers-fired-after-attempting-unionize-spark-nationwide-protests/UETJFCNWLNCCTEVEBIV2YFKU3U/">February mass firing</a> of union leaders in Memphis. Then again on Friday, the <a href="https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1517616253304721410?t=wjLB2Or5KNPOO6FzS__R6Q&s=19">first</a> Starbucks store in Colorado unionized. Struggling to keep track of it all? Reporters at Law360 developed this <a href="https://www.law360.com/employment-authority/starbucks-tracker">tool</a> to track the growth of Starbucks workers’ efforts.</p>
<h3 id="big-oil-loses-big-time">Big Oil Loses Big Time</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals shot down an attempt by top oil firms to move a major climate lawsuit they’re facing to friendlier environs. Six California cities and counties had filed the suit to get the fossil fuel companies to pay for the cost of climate change. While the businesses had tried <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2022/04/us-appeals-court-sends-fossil-fuel-cases-back-to-state-court/">in their legal response</a> to move the case out of California state court to federal court because some fossil fuel extraction takes place in the ocean, which falls under federal court jurisdiction, the appeals court rejected the move. “This is another big, but not surprising, loss for the oil and gas majors,” said Richard Wiles, the President of the Center for Climate Integrity, in response to the ruling. “Three federal appeals courts have now agreed that their arguments to escape accountability in state court do not pass muster. This ruling is a major victory for these California communities seeking their day in court against corporate polluters that spent decades lying about their products’ role in fueling the climate crisis.”</p>
<h3 id="epa-workers-speak-out-for-scientific-integrity">EPA Workers Speak Out for Scientific Integrity</h3>
<p>The 7,500 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees who form the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 are attempting to get a “scientific integrity” article included in their union contract with the federal government, leaders <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/epa-unions-trump-science-protections">told</a><em>BuzzFeed</em>. The union is seeking to include the language in response to the frequent assaults on scientific integrity that the EPA faced under Trump. (The problem also existed under Obama; for example, advocates have alleged that the EPA failed to take <a href="https://flintbeat.com/flint-residents-disappointed-in-bidens-pick-gina-mccarthy-to-lead-climate-team/">quick action</a> on the Flint water crisis.) Joyce Howell, the EPA union's vice president, told <em>BuzzFeed</em> that “we have to be more cynical in putting in safeguards.” Nicole Cantello, another union leader, added that “I think the idea that relying on internal enforceability on scientific integrity is not going to work anymore… Because when you get an administration like we just had, that internal enforceability is going to fail.” Biden’s EPA could agree to immediately resolve this contract issue — and approve the contract as whole — if it so desired.</p>
<h3 id="unionized-nursing-homes-save-lives">Unionized Nursing Homes Save Lives</h3>
<p>A rising labor movement couldn’t have come at a better time, researchers at <em>Health Affairs </em>found this week. The study revealed that unionized nursing homes had 10.8 percent lower resident mortality rate and 6.8 percent lower employee infection rate than non-unionized nursing homes. Given that 200,000 nursing home residents and staff have <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/over-200000-residents-and-staff-in-long-term-care-facilities-have-died-from-covid-19/">died</a> of COVID-19, and just  <a href="http://unionstats.com/">5.4 percent</a> of nursing home staff are union members, it seems that many lives could have been saved if every nursing home worker was part of a union.</p>
<p>While we haven’t seen a big union upsurge among nursing home staff just yet, Starbucks, Verizon, and Amazon workers have shown that such a movement could just be a spark away.</p>
<h3 id="amazon-labor-union-heads-into-next-election-with-confidence">Amazon Labor Union Heads Into Next Election With Confidence</h3>
<p>The upstart Amazon Labor Union’s second election at Staten Island, of a smaller but still huge warehouse of 1,500 workers, <a href="https://www.amazonlaborunion.org/election/">begins</a> on Monday and will continue through April 29. <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1517318787560873986">Bernie Sanders</a> and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be <a href="https://twitter.com/Shut_downAmazon/status/1517511254126043136">rallying</a> with the workers Sunday. Organizers are bullish about their chances of victory, but say the vote is still likely to be close, thanks to Amazon’s aggressive union-busting operation.</p>
<p>Finally, here’s some proof that accountability journalism can make a difference: In response to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/amazons-union-busting-is-subsidized-by-the-government/">our reporting</a> on how Amazon’s anti-union activities could make it ineligible for hundreds of millions in subsidies it receives from state and local governments, the American Federation of Teachers joined the Amazon Labor Union in <a href="https://twitter.com/rweingarten/status/1517155823243255810">filing a complaint </a>with the New York State Attorney General asking for an investigation into Amazon’s compliance with the law and its consequent eligibility for subsidies.</p>
