<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">Plymouth Superbird</a> is easily the single most recognizable car of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-class-69/">the muscle car era</a>. With its aerodynamic nose cone and giant rear wing, it looked totally different than anything else out there.</p>
<p>The Superbird also featured air extractors mounted on the front fenders, and the rear window was also unique to the car. Underneath all of these modifications, though, the Superbird was a 1970 Road Runner.</p>

<p>All of these changes served a purpose. like the Dodge Daytona the year prior, the Plymouth Superbird was designed to be as aerodynamic as possible. These were the cars that would <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gm-motorsports-new-director/">break NASCAR's 200 MPH barrier</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, to make them legal for racing, they had to produce 500 examples for public consumption. As it turns out, they'd make almost four times that many.</p>

<p>The radical body modifications made them a hard sell when they were new, and some dealers even went so far as to remove the wing and nose cone after the cars sat unsold.</p>
<p>Now, they're highly desirable collectibles. Most Superbirds are powered by a 440 cubic inch V8, fed by a single four-barrel carburetor. A very small number are powered by the legendary 426 Hemi.</p>

<p>Just 716 were built with a trio of two-barrel carburetors, dubbed the "Six Pack." <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/205243/1970-plymouth-superbird">This Vitamin C Orange Superbird</a> is one of them. It's currently being offered for sale by St. Louis Car Museum.</p>
<p>With an asking price just under $230,000, there are a select few who can afford to own this rare piece of muscle car (and NASCAR) history. If you're one of the lucky few who can, here's your chance to own a Superbird that's rarer than most.</p>
