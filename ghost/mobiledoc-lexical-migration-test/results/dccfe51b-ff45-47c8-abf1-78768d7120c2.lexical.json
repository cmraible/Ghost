However, that was quickly corrected and there are now rumors circulating that Retro Studios has been working on a Star Fox racing game in the similar vein as <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>.</p>\n<p>Reddit user DasVergeben claimed that the racing title is &#8220;like Diddy Kong Racing mixed with F-Zero&#8221; with an adventure mode, hub world and boss fights.</p>\n<p>We also got this logo posted from a visitor on 4chan, but definitely take this with a grain of salt:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1815\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=900%2C675\" alt=\"Retro Studios Star Fox Grand Prix\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Eurogamer has also stated that the details line up with what they have heard as of late, but I guess we&#8217;ll find out at E3 in less than a months time.</p>\n<p>There was also word that Retro Studios had another game in the works, but that project is believed to be cancelled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what do you think of these rumors?
