<hr>
<p>In the middle of the night, actually at 1:05 am, police in Oxford County, Ontario were called about a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-z06-driver-crashes/">car crash</a> at a business. When officers arrived, they found a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/boosted-2020-silverado/">Chevrolet Silverado</a> had crashed into several cars, many of them classics. The truck turned out to be stolen and we know <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-crashes-house/">everyone is super shocked</a> by that revelation.</p>
<p>It’s always frustrating to see criminals <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminal-fleeing-wrecks-mustangs/">damage valuable classic cars</a> like this. We’re hoping justice is served and the cars can be restored, but if any were all-original it’s an even bigger loss.</p>
<p>According to police, the driver of that stolen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-silverado-pulled-from-oregon-river/">Chevy pickup</a> was driving along and hit a pole, sending it careening into parked cars on the side of the road. That impact in turn sent the truck through the garage door of a local business, where the classic cars were parked.</p>
<p>You can see in the photo a newer Mustang <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hoodie-takes-blame-stolen-bmw/">cushioned the crash</a>, sacrificing itself so the more valuable classics weren’t damaged more seriously. The little pony car is a true hero we will remember properly as it’s stripped for parts to repair Mustangs which crashed whilst leaving car meets.</p>
<p>Local reports didn’t specify exactly what the classic cars which were damaged are, but we’re thinking they’re not all IROC-Zs or Fieros, although <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pontiac-fiero-collection/">one never knows these days</a>. A total damage estimate also wasn’t released to the media, but we’re going to guess this is going to be one expensive repair bill.</p>
<p>As for the driver of that Silverado, they weren’t identified, but they didn’t receive any life-threatening injuries. However, first responders did have to extricate them from the pickup, which is probably why the passenger-side door is torn clean off in the photo. No charges were made by authorities when local reports came through, but we can imagine it will be a long list once that does happen.</p>
