<p>Good things are happening! We just witnessed “what may be the most cataclysmic day so far for the traditional fossil-fuel industry,” according to <em>The New Yorker. </em>Pressure is mounting, meanwhile, for key Democratic holdouts to back reforming the filibuster. Not only that, a powerful labor union is now backing potentially transformative climate change legislation, while D.C. statehood just moved a small step closer to becoming reality.</p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/big-oils-bad-bad-day"><strong>Big Oil’s Bad, Bad Day</strong></a></strong>: “In what may be the most cataclysmic day so far for the traditional fossil-fuel industry, a remarkable set of shareholder votes and court rulings have scrambled the future of three of the world’s largest oil companies,” Bill McKibben writes for <em>The New Yorker. </em>In a single day, a Netherlands court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its carbon emissions by nearly half by 2030, shareholders at Chevron voted to require the company to cut its carbon emissions, and activist shareholders at ExxonMobil replaced at least two of the company’s board members with their own candidates who have pledged to push for climate action.</p>

Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly to help end the filibuster. Other Senate Democrats that had previously opposed filibuster reform have signified their <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/20/22341271/feinstein-filibuster-reform-talking-joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-joe-biden-senate-60-votes">positions may be changing</a> in recent months, leaving Sinema and Kelly as key holdouts.</p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/27/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-economy-2/"><strong>“Rising wages aren’t a bug, they’re a feature”</strong></a></strong>: President Biden this week explicitly challenged the right-wing narrative about alleged labor shortages, arguing that the labor market must be allowed to increase workers’ pay. “When it comes to the economy we’re building, rising wages aren’t a bug; they’re a feature. We want to get something economists call ‘full employment,’” Biden said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/27/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-economy-2/">speech</a> at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio, on Thursday. “Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employees to compete with each other to attract work. We want the companies to compete to attract workers,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/24/dc-statehood-constitutional-letter/"><strong>The Campaign For D.C. Statehood Just Got A Big Boost</strong></a>:</strong> “One of the most nettlesome objections to extending congressional representation to the residents of Washington, D.C., is that it requires a constitutional amendment. Many Republicans say this, which is hardly surprising. But it’s also the position of Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), whose opposition could doom the effort. Now, however, several dozen leading constitutional law experts are weighing in with a new letter that seeks to demolish this argument once and for all, making the case that granting D.C. statehood is absolutely within Congress’ constitutional authority. This should give the cause a big boost at a critical moment,” writes <em>Washington Post</em> opinion columnist Greg Sargent.</p>

<p><strong>• <a href="https://www.afge.org/publication/largest-federal-employee-union-applauds-biden-push-to-remove-fossil-fuel-securities-from-retirement-funds/"><strong>Largest Federal Employee Union Supports Fossil Fuel Divestment:</strong></a></strong> The American Federation of Government Employees has issued a statement in support of Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/">executive order</a> from last week calling on the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to review the risk of climate change to its pensioners. The FRTIB is about to have five vacant seats, which Biden can fill with climate champions who will control divestment decisions. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House and Senate <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/05/27/democrats-seek-to-expand-esg-strategies-in-retirement-plans/">have proposed bills</a> to allow retirement fund fiduciaries to consider environmental, social, and corporate governance factors when suggesting investment strategies, reversing a rule by President Donald Trump that limited their ability to do so.</p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/28/connecticut-tax-wealthy-lamont/"><strong>Pressure Mounts To Tax The Rich In Connecticut</strong></a>: </strong>“In the wealthiest state in the country, a legislative fight is brewing over whether to tax the elite residents who bring the state its superlative. Connecticut boasts the third-largest center for hedge funds in the world, 14 resident billionaires, and trifecta control for the Democratic Party, including a supermajority in the state Senate and a near supermajority in the House. In April, the state’s Finance and Revenue Committee approved a package with tax cuts for poor and middle-class residents, financed largely with new taxes on households earning more than $500,000 per year. But the General Assembly ends June 9, and Connecticut’s Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has declared that he will veto any such move,” Rachel Cohen reports for <em>The Intercept.</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/providence-cafe-coop-union-labor-workers-rhode-island"><strong>When These Workers Unionized, Their Cafe Was Put Up for Sale — So They Bought It</strong></a></strong>: When employees at a cafe in Providence, Rhode Island, voted to form a union, the cafe owner announced that he was selling the cafe. In response, the baristas formed a workers cooperative and bought the cafe for about half a million dollars, turning it into one of only a dozen worker-owned cafes or restaurants in the country.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t sure who to send this to, but <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bezos-weaponizes-the-washington-post-homepage/">this report</a> by David Sirota’s group is disturbing enough for me to stop reading your newspaper... I know it’s really hard to find a job in journalism anymore and even harder to find one that pays the mortgage. You have my sympathies. You really do. But damn, people, when do we stop allowing these oligarchs to run our lives and dominate our civil discourse? WAPO used to be a trusted source.”</p>
