<p>Thanks to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/classic-car-market/">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, we’ve seen all kinds of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-henry-ford-shuts-down-for-coronavirus-outbreak/">automotive venues closed</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/70th-pebble-beach-concours-postponed-covid-19/">events canceled</a> in 2020 and on that list is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-cancelled/">the 2020 SEMA Show in Las Vegas</a>. However, just because everyone isn’t gathering together in Sin City doesn’t mean everything that usually goes into the event has been called off. Both the Battle of the Builders and Young Guns are still going to be held. To help you get excited, SEMA released a video about this 1957 Chevrolet 3200 pickup which will be brawling in the Battle of the Builders.</p>
<p>This truck is being built by Roger’s Rod & Customers, which is located in East Bethel, Minnesota. Ron Hinshaw details out this build in the video and everything seems to be coming along nicely.</p>
<p>You might guess one of the first things they did was stick this pickup on a different chassis, but believe it or not it’s riding on the factory one. The frame has been boxed completely. This Chevy does have a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/remember-the-c4-callaway-twin-turbo-and-zr1/">C4 Corvette</a> front and rear independent suspension. Adjustable hydraulic coilovers allow for up to 5 inches of adjustment, plus those shocks are mounted to adjustable shock towers, so there are a lot of options. Baer brakes with six-piston calipers and 14-inch drilled and slotted rotors are also installed.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to guess with a chassis setup like that this Chevy is running some serious power. There’s a Procharger C-1X supercharger and Holley EFI engine management to maximize everything.</p>
<p>Because this was an actual barn find, the truck needed a lot of bodywork. As you can see, it’s still not looking pretty yet. The plan is to spray it Chrysler Header Orange, shave the door handles, relocate the gas tank to the rear, and install a custom bed with hickory panels. We can’t wait to see how this build turns out once it’s completely finished.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, if you want to throw your hat in the ring for the 2020 SEMA Battle of the Builders there’s still plenty of time. The entry deadline is October 9, 2020. The winner for 2019 was Jim and Mike Ring, who built a beautiful 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Chevy trucks are common sights at the competition, with a ’55 and ’71 C-10 landing in the top four last year.</p>
