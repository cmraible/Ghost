Half are modern models while the others are classic, showing the man has a balanced approach to his car enthusiasm. Most notable is his Dodge Charger customized to look like the General Lee. Not pictured is Shepherd’s Dodge Grand Caravan R/T, so his dedication to Mopar spills over into his family people hauler selection as well."

Considering its value and increased fame, don’t be surprised to see it make a comeback, likely being auctioned instead of Hart keeping it.
