<p>The end of the road for Pontiac came in 2010 when its parent company, General Motors, phased it out. Its history stretched back to 1926 and encompassed some iconic four-wheeled heroes, most notably the fan favorite Trans Am. Alas, we never got our modern-day reincarnation of Bandit’s trusty steed… Or did we? This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/110925/2010-chevrolet-camaro">Hurst Edition Trans Am</a> listed with Restore A Muscle Car might be its spiritual successor.</p>
<p>Just as Pontiac was shutting its doors, General Motors launched an all-new platform with Chevrolet for its fifth generation Camaro. This would have been the perfect basis for a reborn Trans AM — something the tuning legends Hurst certainly thought. Using donor Camaro’s, Hurst created a series of limited edition conversions known as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-gorgeous-69-hurst-olds-442/">Hurst</a> Edition Trans Am.</p>

<p>This beautiful blue example highlights the great work Hurst did on the project, with modern reimagining of key design features. The pointed nose, raked rear deck lid, and distinctive rear lights are all present and correct. A set of Hurst Deep Dish alloy wheel contrast the almost hypnotic shade of blue coating the bodywork. This car was actually built for the SEMA show in 2014 on a stock 2010 Camaro that had covered just 10 miles from new.</p>
<p>The interior hosts a series of upgrades including a Hurst automatic shifter, headrest embroidery, 1978 style gauges, and some carbon fiber trim. On sunny days you can remove the T-Top and enjoy a healthy dose alfresco motoring and that uninterrupted exhaust note.</p>

<p>Beneath the shaker hood and traditional screaming chicken, is a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine. Its performance figures aren’t disclosed in the description, but we’d expect it to be kicking out some serious power. Swapping cogs is taken care of by a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>
<p>This car isn’t just about power, the chassis has received plenty of attention too with Eibach suspension, Brembo brakes, and a set of sticky Pirelli tires fitted to boost handling.</p>
<p>The good news just keeps getting better with this 7000-mile, 1 of 15 car being reduced from $120,000 to $107,000. <a href="https://www.restoreamusclecar.com/vehicles" rel="noopener">Restore A Muscle Car</a> also has a matching <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/110803/1979-pontiac-trans-am" rel="noopener">1979 Trans Am</a> in stock should you want the perfect pair.</p>
