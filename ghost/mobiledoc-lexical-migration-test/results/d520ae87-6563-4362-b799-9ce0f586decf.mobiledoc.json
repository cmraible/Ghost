Other towns nearby and the Tittabawassee River have been overwhelmed by the a surge of water swallowing up buildings, cars, and more. Residents are describing it as the type of event that happens once in 500 years. Livelihoods have been destroyed, including Fieros Forever, a shop and museum located in Sanford."

After all, the Fiero is an anomaly for cars made in the United States and as such enjoys a strong cult following. But regular people don’t get that."

An early-morning call to evacuate the area was given and he was forced to leave his cars behind, including several which were in nearly-perfect condition. In fact, Evans was trying to auction 12 Fieros online, a plan that now will have to be put on hold. However, he was able to move some of his cars out of the area and to location that hopefully will stay dry. However, photographs show at least one car flipped on its roof by the floodwaters."
