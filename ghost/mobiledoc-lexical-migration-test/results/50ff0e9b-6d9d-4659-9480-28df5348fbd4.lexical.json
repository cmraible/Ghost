Libin, a 20+ year tech executive and venture capitalist, is launching mmhmm, a product designed to help people improve their communications over the internet through services like Zoom and Google Meet. According to Libin, mmhmm will define a new category of “IRL+” products that make that hybrid experience more enjoyable and effective than either just online or just real-life. Sounds super interesting, right? I certainly think so. ",

Big Hand makes it easier to communicate visually over video, while also adding a dash of fun to your meetings.
