<h4 id="today-s-stat-"><strong>TODAY’S STAT:</strong></h4>
<p>President Joe Biden campaigned on creating a public health insurance option, but has so far not lifted a finger to make that policy a reality. Now, <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/04/16/an-exchange-public-option-could-save-170-billion/">a new report</a> from the People’s Policy Project shows that if the federal government offered a public option on the health care exchange, it could save <strong>up to $170 billion on health care spending</strong> over the next decade.</p>
<p>Medicare For All, meanwhile, would save even more money on health care spending. According to a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56811">December study</a> from the Congressional Budget Office, a single-payer health care system could save anywhere from $42 billion to $743 billion a year by 2030, depending on policy design.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-scoop-"><strong>TODAY’S SCOOP:</strong></h4>
<p>During <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-fy-2022-budget-and-announces-continuation-middle-class-tax-cuts-help-new">an announcement</a> on the state’s new budget yesterday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made a case for the repeal of the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions by pointing out that removing the limit on such deductions would lower taxes on the state’s top earners.</p>
<p>The state’s new budget <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/nyregion/nyc-budget-taxing-rich.html">raises income taxes</a> on millionaires from 8.82 percent a year to 9.65 percent. “If they repeal SALT, which I believe they must, the net effect in New York will be that we didn’t raise taxes on anyone,” Cuomo said during the announcement.</p>
<p>Across the country, the benefits of a SALT cap repeal would flow mostly to the top 1 percent of earners, as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly/"><em>The Daily Poster</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-somehow-pretend-this-mostly/"> reported</a> this morning. Over 80 percent of the benefit would flow to the top 5 percent of earners.</p>
<p>Billionaires have been longtime backers of Cuomo. In the second half of 2020, 15 billionaire donors <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-cuomo-campaign-contributions-wealth-tax-20210330-ngrop5va5bgirolfr52muo6d3m-story.html">contributed more than</a> half a million dollars to his campaign.</p>
<h4 id="today-s-clicks-"><strong>TODAY’S CLICKS:</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OIL AND GAS PLUGGING: </strong>After drilling in an area, oil and gas companies are supposed to clean up the abandoned wells they leave behind, which leak the greenhouse gas methane. Instead, many of these heavily leveraged companies file for bankruptcy, leaving the cost of cleanup to governments. The price tag for dealing with these abandoned wells could be as much as $280 billion, as <em>The Daily Poster <a href="__GHOST_URL__/fossil-fuel-companies-profited-now/">previously reported</a></em> — but the federal government <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162068/us-big-abandoned-oil-well-problem">doesn’t even have</a> its own reliable estimate of the cost. Biden has a plan to plug the wells, but his plan <a href="https://prospect.org/environment/bidens-promising-problematic-plan-plug-orphaned-oil-gas-wells/">might amount to</a> a bailout for oil and gas companies that should be paying for the cleanup themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>NIKE TRIES TO JUSTIFY TAX AVOIDANCE:</strong> Nike is one of 55 large, profitable companies that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/economy/zero-corporate-tax.html">did not pay</a> a single dollar in federal income taxes in 2020. After this news came out, Nike tried to explain it away with a denial that <a href="https://itep.org/nikes-tax-avoidance-response-does-not-dispute-it-paid-0-in-federal-income-tax/">did everything except</a> deny that it had evaded federal income taxes, the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy reports.</li>
    <li><strong>BE SKEPTICAL OF THE TRUST ACT: </strong>A measure in the <a href="https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-continues-bipartisan-efforts-protecting-arizonans-retirement-and-addressing-future-federal">TRUST Act</a>, sponsored by Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., is reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/wp/2012/11/27/what-is-the-simpson-bowles-commission-and-why-does-it-still-matter/">Simpson-Bowles commission</a>, a committee set up after the 2008 financial crisis to study the national debt and propose spending cuts. Romney and Sinema’s TRUST Act, first proposed as an amendment to the American Rescue Plan, “would be a Trojan Horse to circumvent legislative norms for changing Social Security,” former Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Max Richtman, who leads the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/541622-romneys-trust-act-is-a-trojan-horse-to-cut-seniors-benefits?rl=1">wrote</a> in <em>The Hill</em> last month.</li>
    <li><strong>BAD TREASURY MOVE ON CLIMATE: </strong>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has promised to use the department to tackle climate change, has appointed John Morton to serve as the department’s first climate counselor. Morton is a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/19/treasury-climate-czar-john-morton-483112">former private equity </a>investor with <a href="https://prospect.org/first100/crossroads-for-biden-on-corporate-power/">no regulatory</a> experience.</li>
