While you might expect any manufacturer to keep the first model they ever produced in a museum, that just wouldn’t work from a business perspective. Rather, this work of art was eventually able to make its way into the hands of an enthusiast consumer who likely drove the hell out of it which is why it looks how it does now. Of course, being rusty and old is not exactly something unique to the first Corvette ever produced. So what exactly makes the host the YouTube channel that found this car so sure that it is indeed the first of its kind?"

On top of that, there’s quite a few options that came with the car that simply wouldn’t have been possible if it were any other vehicle. The reasoning behind this was that GM was pretty unprepared for how popular the cars would’ve been in 1953 and as such made quite a few little mishaps along the way which are easily recognizable and make the car stand out as unique with every vehicle. All of these things combine to give pretty good evidence that this may be the first Corvette Chevrolet ever produced."
