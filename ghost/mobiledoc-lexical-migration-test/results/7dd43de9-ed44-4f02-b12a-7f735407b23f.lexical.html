<p>Good things are happening! Few people have managed to use right-wing blowhard Tucker Carlson‚Äôs massive audience for good, but the president of the Amazon Labor Union just showed everyone how it‚Äôs done ‚Äî and along the way made the case for organizing workers. Also, a new study shows that global warming can be greatly reduced by holding governments to their existing promises. And a lawmaker is calling for the United States to give up its exemption from being held accountable for war crimes.</p>

<p>National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo ‚Äî a former colleague of <em>Lever </em>writer Matthew Cunningham-Cook at the Communications Workers of America ‚Äî is taking aggressive action to enforce federal labor law. Her latest broadside is to <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/nlrb-general-counsel-calls-for-4375993/">reinstate</a> the ‚ÄúJoy Silk‚Äù doctrine, whereby the NLRB mandates immediate recognition and bargaining with a union when a majority of workers sign authorization cards.</p>
<p>The problem that Abruzzo & co. are working to solve is the sheer level of delays that employers put up against workers seeking to organize. Depending on the circumstances, it can take months to administer an election ‚Äî needlessly delaying bargaining on a contract, which in and of itself can take a <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-how-long-does-it-take-unions-to-reach-first-contracts">year or longer</a> to come to a resolution.</p>
<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce responded to Abruzzo‚Äôs move with a <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/employment-law/u-s-chamber-strongly-opposes-the-national-labor-relations-boards-joy-silk-doctrine-filing">blistering statement</a>, saying: ‚ÄúWe will oppose this action with every tool at our disposal, including litigation if needed.‚Äù Indeed, with the current composition of the courts, it seems likely that Abruzzo‚Äôs push will be overturned on appeal. But as <em>ProPublica</em> reporter Jesse Eisinger detailed in his excellent tome <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/chickenshit-club-why-the-justice-department-fails-to-prosecute-executives-9781501121364"><em>The Chickenshit Club</em></a>, a key problem that both prosecutors and regulators have is a fear of losing cases, even if the facts on the ground warrant action. Good on Abruzzo for being willing to take a principled stand for workers‚Äô rights, even if it means eventually taking a loss.</p>

<p>This week, Jen Psaki ‚Äî President Joe Biden‚Äôs press secretary ‚Äî announced on the Obama flack alumni project <em>Pod Save America</em> that canceling student debt is ‚Äústill on the table‚Äù and that the Biden administration will either cancel some amount of debt or extend the loan payment pause before the current one ends in August.</p>
<p>While it was a <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1515016592819589120?s=20&t=jwBq2wd7squb6cP7yf7Qvg">pathetic way</a> to deliver an update to millions of struggling debtors, the Debt Collective, the nation‚Äôs first debtors‚Äô union, points out that it is still a major shift in what the administration has been saying on the issue and is good news for debtors.</p>

<p>The most recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midweek-brief-its-now-or-never-says-new-un-climate-report/">UN climate change report warned</a> that even if countries meet their existing carbon emission reduction pledges, the world is on track to overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.</p>
<p>However, a new study shows that existing climate pledges could still significantly limit warming. The study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04553-z">published this week</a> in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/todaysclimate/if-nations-keep-their-promises-2-degrees-of-warming-is-within-reach/">finds</a> that if countries keep the promises they made to reduce carbon emissions at last fall‚Äôs COP26 global climate talks, there is a good chance that warming can be limited to less than 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters, and while a 2 degree-warmer world will bring <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/08/1-5-or-2-degrees-celsius-of-additional-global-warming-does-it-make-a-difference/">much more uncertainty</a>, extreme weather, food shortages, species extinction, and extreme heat than a 1.5 degree-warmer world, the new study shows that the COP26 pledges have paved the path to limit warming ‚Äî if only countries stick to them.</p>
<p>The study authors warn that countries are <a href="https://grist.org/science/global-warming-2-degrees-nature-study/">still far from</a> meeting those pledges, and many countries are moving in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>But two U.S. states may be moving in the right direction. Maryland just forced its Republican governor to sign one of the most aggressive climate laws in the country, <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/maryland-just-passed-one-of-the-most-aggressive-climate-laws-in-the-us"><em>Canary Media</em> reports</a>. And New York state‚Äôs public service commission <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/4/14/23026076/state-approves-electricity-transmission-lines-power-climate-goals">approved two transmission lines</a> that will bring hydroelectric, solar, and wind power to New York City.</p>
