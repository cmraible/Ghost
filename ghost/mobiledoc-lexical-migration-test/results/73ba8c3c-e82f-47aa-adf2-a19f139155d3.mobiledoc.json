Sunny day cruises are much more enjoyable when you open the sunroof and breathe in the fresh air. Other exterior features include rectangular fog lights in white, body side moldings, and a rear wiper. On all four corners sit Cookie Cutter alloy wheels with wheel locks, and they come wrapped with brand new 215/60R15 rubber. Gradual tint was installed on the windshield.

Mechanical highlights include a locking differential, sport shocks, and stabilizer bars. This car was also given updated timing/balance belts, tensioners, shaft roller, cam seal kit, fan switch, crank sensor, and an updated turbo water pump. The quench for thirst is fed through new components including fuel lines, fuel sending unit, fuel pump, fuel filter, and a reconditioned gas tank.
