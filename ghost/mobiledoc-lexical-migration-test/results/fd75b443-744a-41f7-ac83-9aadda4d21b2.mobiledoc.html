That starts with its gorgeous coat of Matador Red paint, which is complemented by the white RS body striping and a black convertible soft top. Being the RS, this Camaro has an unmistakable look with its hidden headlights, while the SS side of the equation packs a 396 CID V8 under the hood. As if this Camaro wasn't desirable enough, the 350-horsepower engine is matched with a four-speed manual gearbox.</p>
<p>Whoever restored this Camaro did an excellent job bringing this car back to its original look right down to the rally wheels and the black and gray houndstooth interior, but some aftermarket touches were added to improve the user experience of this classic. The 396 V8 should sound even better thanks to a Magnaflow exhaust system, and speaking of sound, this car has a modern audio system with Bluetooth capability and ports for both USB and AUX.</p>
