This particular F-100 is even more special since it's a custom restomod painted in one of Ford's most recognizable colors, and it will be up for grabs later this month through <a href="https://www.proxibid.com/Pacific-Auction-Companies/Sam-s-Auto-A-Lifetime-Collection/event-catalog/183963?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Pacific Auction Companies</a>.</p>

<p>It's easy to spot a '56 Ford with its vertical A-pillars and wraparound windshield, but you won't be able to miss this truck wearing a gorgeous coat of Grabber Blue paint. The body and paint look incredible on this truck, and the lowered stance is perfect with those five-spoke chrome wheels and wide running boards. The interior is a little more restratined with a conventional bench seat, but the iconic blue hue blends in wonderfully and aftermarket gauges add a modernized touch.</p>
<p>Tilt the custom hood forward to reveal the heart of this restomodded pickup: a 302 cubic-inch V8 with a roller cam. This engine is matched with an automatic transmission that sends power to the rear tires through a nine-inch rear end, and the addition of power steering, power brakes and air conditioning mean this truck is one serious cruiser.</p>
