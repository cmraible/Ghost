Since it was originally purchased from Westport Motors in Westport, Connecticut by Marilyn Monroe Productions on December 20, 1955 just days before Christmas, it’s possible. But the reality is we’ll never know if those rumors are true. Whatever the reason for the purchase, Marilyn must have fallen in love with the T-Bird and it's easy to see why."

From the factory, it came with a canvas convertible top as well as the detachable hardtop, which features those iconic porthole windows."

Jason had just turned 18. Lee’s wife Paula asked Monroe to not hand over the keys to the Ford for a few years, although she did transfer the title to Jason in the spring. Tragically, the actress died of a barbiturates overdose later that same year. She was only 36."

Then, it was snatched up by a private collector who had it restored by Thunderbird specialists. Because of the historical nature of the car, touch surfaces in the cabin were preserved, not restored."

The auction house estimated it would fetch upwards of $500,000 and it didn’t disappoint, netting $490,000 when the dust settled. However, the identity of the new owner has been kept private and there have been no public sightings of the classic car since. In other words, who owns the movie star’s one and only ride is a mystery for now."
