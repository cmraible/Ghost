<p>Good things are happening! Watch out corporate America: A tidal wave of worker strikes is developing nationwide. Meanwhile, Biden opts to shake up the U.S. Court of Appeals, while the fossil fuel industry just lost a major source of financing. Finally, the ultra wealthy will now have to confront the costs of climate change — at least in the insurance rates they pay for their waterfront mansions.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><strong>• </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/climate/federal-flood-insurance-cost.html?referringSource=articleShare"><strong>The Cost Of Insuring Expensive Waterfront Homes Is About To Skyrocket</strong></a> (The New York Times) — <em>“Florida’s version of the American dream, which holds that even people of relatively modest means can aspire to live near the water, depends on a few crucial components: sugar white beaches, soft ocean breezes and federal flood insurance that is heavily subsidized. But starting Oct. 1, communities in Florida and elsewhere around the country will see those subsidies begin to disappear in a nationwide experiment in trying to adapt to climate change… For the first time, the new rates will also take into account the size of a home, so that large houses by the ocean could see an especially big jump in rates.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

Public defenders are hugely underrepresented on the nation’s courts; the vast majority of federal judges are former prosecutors and corporate attorneys.”</em></p>

Washington required college health insurance plans that cover maternity care to cover abortion. Connecticut banned deceptive advertising from crisis pregnancy centers.
