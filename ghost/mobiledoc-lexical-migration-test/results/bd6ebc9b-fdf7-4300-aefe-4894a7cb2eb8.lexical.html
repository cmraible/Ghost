    <div>Google is starting to smack down spam, but it’s still an issue – affiliate links. </div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Calacanis had some suggestions for the attendees about how to manage this:</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>- Build curation into your service.- Police your service- Reduce anonymity without reducing freedom- Punish bad people<div>Users have to “own your words”. The movement is away from fake people: MySpace had loads, Facebook had less, LinkedIn has none.</div>
        <div></div>
        <div>He also gave us a quick demo of [Mahalo’s new social element](http://greenhouse.mahalo.com/Special:FollowDownload). It’s already a human-powered search engine – ie real people rather than algorithms are behind the results. The new element appears to bring link sharing/recommending to social groups. It could be more than that – I’ll play with it later to see.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>What’s the benefit to new companies of following his suggestions? “Nobody wants to buy real estate in a town filled with toxic waste,” Calacanis replied. “There’s a small amount of pain to go green.”</div>
        <div></div>
        <div>The best quote of all? “As internet people, we shouldn’t bother with people who don’t understand the internet, because they’ll be dead soon.”</div>
