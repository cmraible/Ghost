<p>On Friday 9/17 at 6pm ET (3 pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers spoke with U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., about the fight to preserve social provisions in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that could help transform the country’s approach to child care, immigration, climate change, and other progressive priorities. <strong><u>Subscribers can find a link to a replay of the live cast posted below.</u></strong></p>
<p>Boyle is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and serves on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which is overseeing the markup of key tax and health care portions of the reconciliation bill this week. <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will talk with him about the push to make sure fossil fuel companies, corporate interests, and the ultra wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. We will also discuss progressive lawmakers’ push to keep the infrastructure bill and reconciliation bill tied together.</p>
