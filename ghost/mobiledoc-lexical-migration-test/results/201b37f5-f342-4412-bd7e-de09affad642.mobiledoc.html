<p>When you enter the win this <a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2021ShelbyGT500?promo=SD2">2021 Shelby GT500 Mustang</a>, you're entering for your chance at becoming the owner of a brand new, 760 horsepower, supercharged beast of a modern muscle car. That and the $25,000, but there's another option is you're not entirely in love with this particular car...</p>
<p>If you're not a red car person, or maybe not even a <a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2021ShelbyGT500?promo=SD2">Mustang person</a> at all, you can take the cash option of $75,000 when you win - and while you're friends might think you are totally bonkers, we get it, we like picking out our own color too. </p>
