After all, the little Japanese sports car is legendary in large part for its rotary engine which is small and relatively lightweight. Dropping the massive Italian mill up front should change everything."

In other words, he likes to be an innovator, to be out in front of everyone else instead of running with the pack. It’s because of people like him that we can have cool things."

We imagine most people who buy Paganis of the Mercedes these V12 were used in aren’t into heavily modifying their rides, but instead spend a lot of money on them and then have them detailed once a week. This was a challenge, a trail that needed to be blazed."
