<hr>
<p>If you were one of the lucky kids, your parents got your a ruby red <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/6/?ahid=21420">Radio Flyer</a> with wooden sides and you would just beat it to death, and it would take it like a champ. Once you became too big to ride around in it, you would take the dog for a ride, and maybe haul around your lego collection to the next-door neighbor kid’s house. Or maybe your had parents like mine, and you got the rip off plastic version, ‘because safety’, either way, you gotta admit that you miss your wagon, as a pillar of your childhood nostalgia if nothing else. However, you can bring home a full size, fully functional street wagon and haul around all of the dogs you can find, plus the legos, and fit in there with them.</p>

<p><a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/6/?ahid=21420">Originally billed</a> as a 1993 Ford Pickup Truck, a New York couple decided it was high time grown ups had a Radio Flyer they could take to church, and here we are. It’s said to go up to 70 mph, which seems a little intense. Impressively, it actually gets 19 mpg, which is a decent number for even today’s trucks, without the added paneling.</p>
