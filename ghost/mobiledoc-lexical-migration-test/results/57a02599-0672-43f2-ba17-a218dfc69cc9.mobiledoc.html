<p>Workshop sessions at conferences are always a roll of the dice. A session on solutions journalism hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ninafasciaux?lang=en">Nina Fasciaux</a> of the <a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org">Solutions Journalism Network</a> was an interesting one.</p>
<p>Why?</p>

<p>She proved that a room full of journalists think the world is in a worse state than they actually do, via an online quiz. Despite the fact that most people get into journalism to make the world better, our news is all about problems - not solutions. That creates an unbalanced, fearful view of the world — one that is being exploited by some politicians.</p>
<p>For example, did you know how Nigeria stopped Ebola? <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/10/20/how-nigeria-stopped-ebola"><em>The Economist</em> has you covered</a> - but did you know that?</p>
<p>Hence: solutions journalism. "solution" might not even be the right word. It's probably more "response" journalism. It's a less sexy name, for a less sexy concept: not getting bored of stories. Following them through. Reporting on fixes - and solutions. Not just reporting on the problem, and then moving on without ever revisiting the issue.</p>
<p>Here's a video example from <em>Vox</em>:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZORzsubQA_M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It's not fluffy stories, or historic stories, but rigorous journalism on things that are happening <em>now</em> that are having an effect on the world. It needs rigorous details of impact and effectiveness. Inspiration is good - but not enough. Solutions journalism should leave you feeling you understand the problem - and how effective the solutions have been in addressing it.</p>
<p>Research shows that overwhelming people with problems makes them apathetic, while giving then an opportunity to do something about it makes them much more engaged and interested.</p>
<p>In many cases, solutions-based stories have better shares, engaged time and traffic. So much for "if it bleeds, it leads".</p>
<h2 id="theoppositeofsolutionsjournalism">The opposite of solutions journalism</h2>
<p>To some degree, you can define solutions journalism by what it isn't. It is not:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hero worship</strong> - stories about people are less effective than ones that use people to illustrate systemic change.</li>
    <li><strong>Not a silver bullet</strong> - you can have a serious article about the impact that physical activity has on children's education, for examples, that also addresses the difficulties.</li>
    <li><strong>Not a favour for a friend</strong> - stay focused on the pros and cons.</li>
    <li><strong>A theory</strong> - you are looking at something that is <em>already happening</em> and the effect that brings.</li>
    <li><strong>An afterthought</strong> - a tacked on bit in a piece talking about the problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Activism</strong> - you need to look at all solutions, not one.</li>
    <li><strong>Fluff</strong> - there's plenty of other places for cat reporting…</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about moving from being a <em>watch dog</em> to a <em>guide dog</em> - don't just expose problems, look at how those problems are being solved elsewhere.</p>
<p>If people aren't aware of the problem, than you probably need to be focusing on traditional investigative reporting. Solutions journalism only really kicks in when there's a volume of awareness - and outrage.</p>
