<hr>
<p>Licensed by Ford Motor Company, <a href="https://www.classic-recreations.com/">Classic Recreations</a> has a high reputation for their high-quality custom Ford builds. The most recent concoction to come from the Oklahoma-based company is a high-powered 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1. Nicknamed the "Hitman", the Mach 1 will join other Ford licensed Mustang builds such as the Boss 429 and Boss 302.</p>

<p>Starting off with an authentic Mach 1 shell that has been restored to a factory-new state, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/391768/1968-ford-mustang-restomod-villain">Classic Recreations</a> then stuffs the car with a potent power plant in the form of a twin-turbocharged Ford 32-valve Coyote V8 engine. With this setup, the "Hitman" generates 1,000-horsepower. Yes, you read that right, this classic will have 1,000 ponies under the hood ready to gallop. </p>

<p>Shifting power is provided by a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission and through a 9-inch rear end with Posi-Traction, and the car is equipped with tubular subframe connectors. Giving the car even more performance and rumble is a set of custom stainless steel turbo manifolds and dual stainless steel MagnaFlow performance mufflers. Quenching the thirst for fuel is an electric Vaporworx fuel pump inside the Rick's Tanks fuel cell that is good for 18 gallons.</p>

<p>To handle the insane amount of power and plant it to the ground is a suspension set up that has been engineered specifically for this purpose. Suspension components consist of coilovers up front, a Total Control rear coilover system, and Total Control front and rear sway bars. For easy steering, a power rack and pinion steering system is also installed. Bringing everything to a halt are 6-piston Wilwood calipers that work with slotted and cross-drilled rotors all around. Depending on driving style and use, an adjustable rear proportioning valve gives the driver utmost control over brake bias by allowing them to match their settings. The "Hitman" is also equipped with a BeCool aluminum crossflow radiator with dual electric cooling fans to keep temperatures in check and ensure everything runs smoothly. </p>

<p>The exterior of the Mach 1 is painted in an attractive two-tone grey and black by Classic Recreations. Other exterior highlights include a factory-style <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/187729/1969-ford-mustang-mach-1">Mach 1</a> front chin spoiler and rear decklid spoiler. Even more, the car is adorned with Mach 1 badges that have been placed accordingly that mimics the car's iconic design. A set of 18-inch lightweight American Racing Wheels sit on all four corners and come wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport 2s (225/40R18 front, 315/30R18 rear) so traction isn't an easy. </p>
<p>Inside, an "Old Air" air conditioning system keeps the cabin nice and cool. Ensuring that your favorite tunes are high-quality is a JVC head unit that plays through a Kicker amplifier, speakers, and subwoofers. Also installed inside the Mach 1 is a woodgrain aluminum steering wheel, five-point seat belts, 200-mph gauges, TMI interior panels, and a cosmetic rollbar.</p>
