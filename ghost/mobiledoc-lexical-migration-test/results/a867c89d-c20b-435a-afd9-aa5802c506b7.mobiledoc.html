<p>A few weeks ago, <em>The Daily Poster </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-american-rescue-plans-money-cannon/">noted</a> that the exclusion of a $15 minimum wage from the American Rescue Plan was a missed opportunity and a tragic failure. Then again, our reporting also pointed out same bill’s direct aid to millions of people was an enormous victory and a huge success for a grassroots movement that has so changed politics that even a former longtime austerian like Joe Biden ended up signing legislation that included those investments.</p>
<p>On this new podcast, Sirota talked to author and MSNBC contributor Anand Giridharadas about the idea of losing and winning — and whether or not we are finally moving out of the Reagan Era and into a new epoch of positive change. Giridharadas is the author of the fantastic book <em><a href="https://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781101972670">Winners Take All</a></em> and has a great newsletter called <em><a href="https://the.ink">The Ink</a></em>.</p>
<p>During the discussion, they talked about how to simultaneously remember the <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseStudyQB/status/1379633061046980611?s=20">awful and unforgivable parts</a> of Biden’s senate record, remain circumspect about his commitment to progressive change, criticize his ongoing capitulations, but also acknowledge some of the victories that are being won during the early weeks of his presidency.</p>
