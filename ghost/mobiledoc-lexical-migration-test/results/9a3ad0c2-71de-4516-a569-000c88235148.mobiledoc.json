The SWB Berlinetta models struggled when they tried pushing beyond 155 mph, thanks to a blunt nose on the car. This design is longer and has a narrow, more sculpted front fascia which allows the wind to flow over it. Sergio Scaglietti was responsible for the design innovation and he used a wind tunnel extensively for the project. What we get is a beautiful and highly functional machine capable of hitting 170 mph, or being able to hold its own on a tough hill climb."
