That’s was good enough to set a record for the highest auction price for a Miura. It’s an exceptional example, for sure, with a certification from Lamborghini Polo Storico with the black certification box and all associated documents. The supercar also went through a full Jota conversion. Keep in mind only 150 Miuras were made and many consider it to be the first true supercar ever."
