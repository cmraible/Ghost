A spokesman told local journalists the Camaros will be used to catch extreme speeders and to respond to street racing incidents."

          "\"The 0 to 120 or 100 MPH is way faster than the Dodge Charger so that makes catching up to vehicles way easier,\" the spokesman said. We’re not entirely clear on all the details in that statement, so feel free to argue in the comments about what it all means. But it definitely sounds like something you might hear at a contentious car meet as a Chevy guy tries trashing all the Mopars."

We also don’t know if they’re actually pursuit rated since we’ve never heard of such a thing for a Camaro (if you have, please let us know). However, the Georgia State Patrol spokesman did admit they’re also useful for recruiting new troopers. Just wait until those new recruits receive the jankiest vehicles in the fleet, not a Camaro."

Most aren’t used in many real-world policing situations since they’re obviously not as utilitarian as the Dodge Charger, Ford Explorer, Chevy Tahoe, etc. But they sure are great for agencies’ image and getting people talking when representatives show up at public events."
