<p>Lately, the Nintendo Switch has seen a lot of third-party support and the console is beginning to get third-party titles much quicker.</p>
<p>At E3, it was great to see titles like DragonBallZ get a proper Switch announcement, as well as Starlink: Battle for Atlas receiving the same release date as on other platforms.</p>
<p>In an interview at E3, Reggie stated that the delay in ports has been due to the system only being out for 16 months, and that it takes time for games that teams have been working on for a long time to suddenly port be ported to Switch. However now that developers will be beginning new titles with the Switch development kit in hand, the bridge will be closing in 2019.</p>
<p>Here’s his full quote here…</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We’re talking today about a platform that is 16 months old. The development cycle today is multiple years. So I would argue that beginning at the end of this year, or next year, that gap will have closed. Because key developers have had the development systems, they’ll have been working to create content for our platform from the beginning. That’s what is going to close that time gap.</p>
