<p>Sensationalized in films such as Bullitt and Gone in 60 Seconds, the Fastback was one of the <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">Mustangs</a> most famed body styles. However, the <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">Fastback body style</a> was popular among buyers long before the film industry got a hold of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cars-as-investments/">car</a>. In 1965, it was the highest produced body style with over 70,000 examples rolling off the line. </p>

<p>Although, in 1966 the fastback took a backseat to the convertible and hardtop models before ultimately gaining in popularity again in 1967. A constant through the entire first generation, though, was the popularity of the Wimbledon White finish that dominated the first two years of production. In total, Ford produced over 225,000 Wimbledon White examples and around 187,000 Fastback Mustangs making a <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">Wimbledon White Fastback</a> model one of the most popular Mustangs of the first generation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">This car</a> is well built with an iconic look and many aftermarket performance parts and shows very little wear inside and out but it is far from perfect. According to the ad, there are signs of body filler on the quarter panels and the interior would benefit from having the carpet replaced. However, for <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1967-ford-mustang-fastback/">the Mustang</a> enthusiast looking for an iconic pony car to tour the American back-roads in, it doesnâ€™t quite get better than this.</p>
