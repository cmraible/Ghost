<p>Unique looks combined with a small footprint <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0421/open-roads--april/lots/r0120-1972-amc-gremlin-x/1078761?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">made the Gremlin</a> a good choice for the commuter. Meanwhile AMC had set out to make a name for itself in the performance industry with models such as the Javelin AMX. However the X classification was not only limited to the Javelin, this badge was also extended to many other models such as the Gremlin. This brings us to today's subject for discussion, a beautiful <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0421/open-roads--april/lots/r0120-1972-amc-gremlin-x/1078761?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">1972 AMC Gremlin X</a>. </p>

<p>While some could mistake it for just a retro style commuter, this car is holding a secret in its engine bay. Under the hood of <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0421/open-roads--april/lots/r0120-1972-amc-gremlin-x/1078761?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">this gorgeous Gremlin</a> is the special 5.0-liter V8. What makes this engine specification unique is that this is one of just 10,949 V8 Gremlins produced in the 1972 model year. Power is fed to the Crager S/S wheels through a 3-speed manual transmission and stopping power comes courtesy of factory disc brakes. </p>

<p>In comparison to the usual Ford, Chevy, and Mopar collectors cars that frequent auctions such as the RM Sotheby’s Open Roads event, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0421/open-roads--april/lots/r0120-1972-amc-gremlin-x/1078761?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">this Gremlin</a> really stands out in value. Despite the rarity of this vehicle, the expected price sits at just around $40,000-$50,000 and with the odometer reading a mere 28,000 miles, it is likely that as time goes on this value will only increase. Value aside though, it’s hard to imagine a funner driver’s car than this overpowered economy car and the very unique style it brings to the table is undeniable. <br></p>
