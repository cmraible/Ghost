<h3 id="from-vintage-to-modern-these-celebrities-drive-some-sweet-pickup-trucks">From vintage to modern, these celebrities drive some sweet pickup trucks.</h3>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/1963-toyota-fj45-split-window-pickup/">pickup truck</a> is an American staple. First invented in 1896, the pickup was stuffed with a 2-cylinder engine with an output of 4-horsepower. In fact, it was promoted as a horseless wagon over 100 years ago. Pickup trucks have come a long way since then as they now boast incredible power, tow heavy loads, and have plenty of room in the bed to transport those necessities.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/1962-ford-e100-econoline-pickup/">Pickup trucks</a> are attractive and can be found on the road just as much as any car. It would only make sense that some celebrities would be driving trucks, too. Here is a list of 20 celebrities that also drive cool pickup trucks. These are in no particular order.</p>
<p><em><strong>20. Channing Tatum (Chevrolet 3100)</strong></em></p>

But, the fact that he rolls around in an old-school Chevy pickup gives him ample cool points in our book.</p>
<p><em><strong>19. Willie Robertson (Ford F-150)</strong></em></p>
