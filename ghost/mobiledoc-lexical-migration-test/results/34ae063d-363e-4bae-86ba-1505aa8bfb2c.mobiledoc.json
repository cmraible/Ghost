Supposedly it’s a totally serious, non-publicity-stunt move, or so Amazon wants us to believe in his new series. Whether you want to watch Clarkson plowing fields instead of prattle on about why the Porsche 911 is really just a Volkswagen Beetle, the benefit we receive from this strange career move is a brief tour of the man’s childhood diecast cars collection."

          "Whatever you think of the whole farming thing, Clarkson’s childhood diecast car collection definitely isn’t staged. It’s always suspicious when someone has their old Hot Wheels cars they supposedly cherished and played with at the ripe age of 8, yet there isn’t a single scratch on them. That would indicate either some setup staged by some production assistants or that someone was a complete psychopath as a child."

In fact, the man says he painted many of them, which is pretty obvious considering they’re wearing multiple interesting colors in some patchwork a child would’ve found absolutely dazzling."

That’s due in part to the fact that children tend to be pretty rough with their toys, so most were crashed into each other, driven hard on dirt roads made in the backyard, and maybe even set on fire by pyro little children."
