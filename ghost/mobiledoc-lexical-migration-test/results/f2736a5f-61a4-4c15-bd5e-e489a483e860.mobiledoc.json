This particular politician didn’t back down when he was called out or even walk back his claims one bit. Instead, the guy leaned in hard, acknowledging he was being torched for what were obviously ridiculous statements as he tried defending them as rational by attacking the integrity of other Twitter users. Then he launched into a lesson about modern trucks already being larger and more powerful than at any time in the past, as if he were sharing a little-known nugget of information, which to him means obviously nobody should be modifying them. It's an interesting argument he never fully fleshed out, since taking offense at personal attacks seemed to be his main priority."
