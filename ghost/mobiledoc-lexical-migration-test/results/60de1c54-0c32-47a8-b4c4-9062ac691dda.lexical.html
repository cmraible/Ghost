<hr>
<p>Back in early June we covered a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-torch-porsche/">Porsche 911 GT3 RS</a> which was stolen, vandalized, and ultimately torched <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wisconsin-rioters-loot/">by rioters</a> in Beverly Hills. It was a truly sad sight to behold, because such a special car is made in limited quantities. However, just like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alpina-z8-crashed/">Alpina Z8</a>which was stolen and crashed by looters in Santa Monica, the Porsche lives on. Only, the car even in its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/looters-steal-hellcats/">damaged state</a> is fully operational, which shows just how tough these little Germans actually are.</p>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-riots-are-affecting-the-auto-industry/">graffiti is still present</a>, as is the fire damage. All the glass except the windshield has been removed, what little was left. One of the side mirrors is gone and so is the majority of the rear wing. You can also see where someone bashed the fenders and roof with a baseball bat or pole. But, considering the thrashing this car received at the hands of a violent mob, the fact it even runs is nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p>As you can see in the video included with this article, YouTuber effspot, the guy who originally brought us video of this car as it was being brutalized, tracked it down at an undisclosed location. He contacted the owner who bought it at auction no doubt for a song and a dance. The guy climbs in the Porsche and that flat-six engine just fires up with zero hesitation. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/six-classic-cars-found-sunk-in-a-river/">Crazy</a>!</p>
<p>The interior doesn’t seem too bad, although the headliner is messed up from the fire and the seats have towels on them because there’s melted plastic from a water bottle on them. Hopefully all the damage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/rare-alpina-z8-restoration-progress/">will be fixed</a> in the near future.</p>
<p>Then the owner gives effspot a ride in the car, so you can see it still runs great. In fact, they do some pretty good runs to show there’s nothing wrong mechanically. Now we know what car we want to drive during the apocalypse.</p>
<p>As a bonus, if you keep watching the video you’ll see a Lamborghini Aventador S pull up to a light and rev its raucous V10, a guy in a Mercedes-Benz GLS 450 next to him lining up like he wants to race, then the Lambo just takes off. More supercars and hypercars are included as well. Effspot seems to know where to go to capture these kinds of crazy scenes.</p>
