<p>This turnkey <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImZvcmQiLCJoaWdoYm95Il19" rel="nofollow">Ford Highboy</a> has only about 2,000 miles on it since the build was completed, so everything works and looks great. Speaking of looks, the matte black really portrays the sinister nature of the car without getting too crazy. To keep things from getting too dark, the wheels, headlight surrounds, grille, etc. feature just the right amount of brightwork.</p>
<p>That staggered stance indicates this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> hot rod is ready to roast the competition. Lift up the engine cowling and you’ll find a 350ci V8, which breathes freely through an Edelbrock 4bbl carb. Shorty headers and a Borla dual exhaust creates that rumble you’ll crave every day. A four-speed manual transmission allows you to control just how much wheel spin you want to inflict, while a limited-slip Ford 9-inch rear keeps you from slipping and sliding all over the place.</p>
<p>If you’ll notice, the photo of the undercarriage looks as clean as the car’s exterior. It also flashes the Peter & Jake’s front disc brakes kit, plus hairpins in the front. Rear ladder bars with adjustable coilovers complete the nice setup.</p>
<p>You’re not just dealing with power in this Ford Highboy Roadster, because the interior was built for comfort. While the black color scheme continues, white seat inserts and Hurst shifter knob, plus polished controls help balance everything out.  Upgrades include AutoMeter gauges, a heater, tilt steering adjustment, and an AM/FM/CD sound system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the big reason to grab this Ford <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/hot-rods-and-restomods" rel="nofollow">hot rod</a> is the neck-snapping performance. The fact it looks understated and cool, plus packs some nice conveniences is just the icing on the cake.</p>
