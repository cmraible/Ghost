<hr>
<p>A pet <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jerry-bird-birdman-at-firebird/">peacock</a> in the UK is in hot water after it vandalized a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bmw-keep-old-car/">BMW</a> parked at an art center. We’ve all been frustrated to find a BMW driver take up more than one spot in a parking lot, and while most of us are mature enough to just mumble something under our breath, others might decide to teach the owner a lesson. We’re not saying that’s what happened here, because reports of the incident don’t indicate that’s the case, but we wouldn’t be surprised if this is a case of karma being served up.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a BMW drive right over a Toyota Corolla <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bmw-drives-over-toyota/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>According to Daily Mail, a peacock named Toby which is run by John Blunt, the man who runs Ferrers Centre in Stauton Harold, UK, pecked at the BMW’s black paint because the bird saw its own reflection. Thanks to the sharp beak, the peacock reportedly did hundreds of pounds of damage to the paint.</p>
<p>Blunt said “it’s quite common” for peacocks to peck their own reflection, but added “it’s a first time” the bird has attacked a car for that reason. We imagine the BMW had a nice mirror shine to it, making for the perfect improvised mirror to get Toby all worked up.</p>
<p>Legally, Blunt has been held responsible for the damage to the Bimmer. Because he’s afraid something like this could happen again, the man has locked up the peacock. Sadly, a lot of people show up to the art center to interact with Toby, so this has ruined that dynamic. This is why we advocate scaring your peacocks straight when they’re young and impressionable, otherwise they might turn out to either be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/phoenix-vandal-brake-lines/">vandals</a> or even worse, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/kia-hyundai-theft-ballooning/">steal Kias</a> in their spare time.</p>
<p>To help calm Toby down, Blunt bought a girlfriend peacock. So far she’s “playing hard to get” so Toby is probably still quite frustrated.</p>
