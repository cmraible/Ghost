While compared to the second-gen supercars that seems like a lot, consider for a moment the Heritage Edition models were only made for the 2006 model year with production capped at 343. That alone makes these supercars desirable, but there’s much more to them."

Ford called it the Heritage Paint Livery Package (68G) and it proudly features Heritage Blue Clearcoat paint with Epic Orange racing stripes as well as white vinyl roundels on the doors, hood, and decklid."

Slightly larger and able to accommodate taller drivers as a result, the Blue Oval used these supercars to lure away shoppers from competitors like Ferrari, carrying on the legacy of the GT40 once more. The fact it does 0-60 in 3.7 seconds and can hit 200 mph definitely helped."
