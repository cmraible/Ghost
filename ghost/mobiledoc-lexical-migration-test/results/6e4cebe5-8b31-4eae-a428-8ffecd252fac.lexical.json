Delays pushed back this car's completion to late 1991, and it was given an updated VIN at the time to reflect the 1991 model year.

As fast as the W8 is, its design is truly what made it a super supercar with an aerospace-minded shape and advanced body construction that utilized fiberglass, carbon fiber and Kevlar.
