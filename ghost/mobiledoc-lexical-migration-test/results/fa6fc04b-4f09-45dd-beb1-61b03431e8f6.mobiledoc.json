The group of enthusiasts who compete in these events call themselves “Mad Buckets.” There must be some additional meaning to that name in Russian, whatever it might be. These races don’t look nearly as big as a lot of street-legal drag racing events in the United States, but we don’t really see much drag racing in Russia, so for that reason alone it’s still pretty interesting to watch."

Seriously, if you want to see the dysfunction of the Soviet Union portrayed in a potent way, just look into the many awful cars produced during that reign of terror, like the Lada, Zil, Gaz, and Uaz. Some people might wax nostalgic about those rolling buckets of bolts just because they’re not a part of everyday life no, just like the bread lines and people being disappeared regularly, but they don’t hold a candle to something like a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS."
