This Corvette is perfect to show, but this powertrain combination makes this car beg to be driven. In addition to the car itself, the winning bidder will also get all of the photographs and receipts to verify the restoration. The National Corvette Restorers Society has verified several details, and it's probably in NCRS Top Flight award condition as it sits."
