<p>Pharmaceutical innovation is a boon to society — if the fruits of that innovation make it in the hands of the people needing them. That hasn’t been the case with some of the lifesaving medicines developed to treat COVID-19, despite President Joe Biden’s promises earlier this year to make the drugs widely available. As the pandemic continues to wreak global devastation without a clear end in sight, the lack of accessible antiviral treatments is yet another example of how the White House has failed to stop the virus’ spread or mitigate its impacts — particularly among the elderly and otherwise immunocompromised. As Zeynep Tufekci notes in a <em>New York Times</em> opinion piece we highlight below, “Under these political conditions, rescue may not be on its way for a long time, if ever.”</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/opinion/covid-pandemic-drugs-treatment.html"><strong>Covid Drugs Save Lives, But Americans Can’t Get Them</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“Almost two months after President Biden promised to make lifesaving drugs against Covid widely available to Americans, the medications remain hard to get for many, despite supplies, leaving large numbers of Americans to face increased risks of avoidable death and serious illness. That’s largely because, once again, a dysfunctional health care system that costs more and often delivers less than that of any other developed country has hindered our pandemic response.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/22/cuts-to-unemployment-benefits-didnt-spur-jobs-says-report.html"><strong>Cuts To Unemployment Benefits Didn’t Spur Jobs, Report Says</strong></a> (CNBC) <em>— <em>“State cuts to pandemic unemployment benefits last summer had a small impact on hiring, suggesting enhanced funding for the unemployed didn’t play a big role in labor shortages, according to a recent report.”</em></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens"><strong>How Democracies Spy On Their Citizens</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— <em>“Commercial spyware has grown into an industry estimated to be worth twelve billion dollars. It is largely unregulated and increasingly controversial. In recent years, investigations by the Citizen Lab and Amnesty International have revealed the presence of Pegasus on the phones of politicians, activists, and dissidents under repressive regimes. An analysis by Forensic Architecture, a research group at the University of London, has linked Pegasus to three hundred acts of physical violence... Further reporting through a collaboration of news outlets known as the Pegasus Project has reinforced the links between NSO Group and anti-democratic states. But there is evidence that Pegasus is being used in at least forty-five countries, and it and similar tools have been purchased by law-enforcement agencies in the United States and across Europe.”</em></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/04/17/public-libraries-books-censorship/"><strong>Censorship Battles’ New Frontier: Your Public Library</strong></a> (Washington Post) —<em> “Llano joins a growing number of communities across America where conservatives have mounted challenges to books and other content related to race, sex, gender, and other subjects they deem inappropriate. A movement that started in schools has rapidly expanded to public libraries, accounting for 37 percent of book challenges last year, according to the American Library Association. Conservative activists in several states, including Texas, Montana, and Louisiana have joined forces with like-minded officials to dissolve libraries’ governing bodies, rewrite or delete censorship protections, and remove books outside of official challenge procedures.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/alfreda-scheuer-cia-torture-queen-life-coach-1340433/"><strong>The CIA’s ‘Torture Queen’ Is Now a Life Coach Hawking Beauty Products</strong></a> (Rolling Stone) —<em> “America’s War on Terror changed millions of lives irrevocably. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Iraqis, Afghans, Libyans, Yemenis, Somalians, and Syrians saw their homes, jobs, and family members stolen in a two-decade wave of violence that has yet to fully subside. Thousands of people – some guilty, some not – were abducted, interrogated, tortured, and detained without trials. The woman who presided over or witnessed many of these crimes is now a life coach.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/end-reedy-creek-disney-wont-pay-more-taxes-you-will/3TK6ASNJT5EXHICW3DQ3ZHEZYA/"><strong>End Of Reedy Creek: Disney Won’t Pay More Taxes, But You Will</strong></a><strong></strong>(WFTV)<em> — <em>“One of the biggest myths circulating on the internet is that the end of Reedy Creek will finally force Disney to pay its fair share of taxes, boosting the economies of Florida, and the counties its resorts are located in. Let’s dispel that rumor right now: not only is it wrong, it’s the opposite that will take effect.”</em></em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/anti-asian-racism-women/"><strong>Sex, Death, and Empire: The Roots of Violence Against Asian Women</strong></a> (The Nation) —<em> “As a journalist, I understand why the media are reluctant to go beyond what police say. And for police, hate crimes require a higher burden of proof — though some have used their increase to advocate for higher police budgets. As an activist, I also know that hate crimes carry heavier sentences, condemning many who are themselves the victims of a broken society to face an inhumane system of incarceration that fails to address the root causes of crime. Yet as an Asian woman in America, the who-knows-if-race-played-a-role reporting feels like cultural gaslighting, denying both our experience and America’s history.”</em></li>
