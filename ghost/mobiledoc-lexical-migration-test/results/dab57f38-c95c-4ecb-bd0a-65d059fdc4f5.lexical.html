<p>We’ve already covered the show <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dan-kahn-driven/"><em>Car Kings</em></a>, which chronicles the adventures of Galpin Auto Sports in Los Angeles on Discovery Channel. It started strong with a restoration of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driven-restores-carroll-shelbys-detomaso-pantera/">Carroll Shelby’s De Tomaso Pantera</a>, but now it’s taken a turn for the awesomely weird. That’s right, Beau Boeckmann and crew have restored The Bathtub Buggy, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">hot rod</a> everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>Built in 1968 by Rob Reisner, The Bathtub features two side-by-side bathtubs for passenger compartments, proving the Cialis <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/farrah-fawcett-ford-mustang-ad-is-wonderful-nostalgia/">commercials</a> weren’t that original. The driver’s seat is a toilet because what else would you expect it to be? Naturally, the controls are repurposed plumbing fixtures. This is a weird ride that will fascinate even non-car people for understandable reasons.</p>

<p>If you think this hot rod is all show and no go, it uses a supercharged <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/check-out-this-pair-of-one-off-70s-mopars/">Hemi</a>. Keeping everything together literally is a hot rod-style chassis.</p>
<p>George Barris promoted The Bathtub, but ultimately it ended up in the Barris garage sale, a sad fate for such a unique build. Then Galpin got its hands on the car, bringing it back to its glory.</p>

<p>This is about what you should expect from <em>Car Kings</em>. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driven-restores-carroll-shelbys-detomaso-pantera/">In a previous interview</a>, Boeckmann said he has eclectic car tastes which obviously include the bizarre. It’s refreshing to see a car show where genre boundaries are crossed over freely, something we’ve gotten from <em>Jay Leno’s Garage</em> but few others.</p>

<p>Among the upcoming cars on the show we know about is a build by none other than <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/389851/ed-big-daddy-roth-exhibit">Big Daddy Roth</a> and the Batmobile from the 1960s TV show. In addition, instead of manufactured crisis and drama, the show gives us a real behind-the-scenes look at how the shop goes about bringing <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/357959/auto-industry-legend-lee-iacocca-dies-at-94">automotive legends</a> back to life.</p>

<p>You might already know Galpin Auto Sports from MTV’s <em>Pimp My Ride</em>. That’s not the most positive association but this new show is far superior. Episodes air every Monday at 10 pm PT/ET but if you don’t have cable you can watch the first few episodes for free <a href="https://go.discovery.com/tv-shows/driven">here</a>.</p>
