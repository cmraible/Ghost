<p>The idea of destiny gets thrown around a lot these days, whether it's in some cheesy romance novel, a love letter written between spouses, or a great piece of music that seems to have perfectly fit the generation. All of these things are something that most of us have experienced at one point or another, as the world is full of strange and often beautiful coincidences that seem like fate. However, there is a particular type of destiny that only a few of us have genuinely felt in our lives. This is the thing that keeps coming back to you no matter how many times you lose it. That's precisely what happened between this man and his 1965 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ls7-powered-chevelle/">Chevrolet Chevelle</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, the owner's father gifted the car to him in high school, officially making his son the coolest high schooler ever. Eventually, the kid sold the vehicle and later regretted selling his beloved muscle car while reminiscing with buddies at the bar. After hearing about how much he missed his old car, one of the owner's friends found the vehicle for him, and the pair picked it back up from where the car had been sitting. You might think that this story is heart-warming enough, but that certainly isn't where it ends. Shortly after retrieving his car, he sent the vehicle to a paint shop to redo the exterior, where the shop promptly lost the car somehow. Nowadays, the car is back in the hands of its rightful owner with a pretty crazy powerplant under the hood.</p>
<p>Powering this Victory Red 1965 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/the-legend-of-the-chevy-chevelle/">Chevrolet Chevelle</a> is a slightly bored-out LS1 355 ci V8 engine that makes power with a Whipple supercharger. That powerhouse initially came in the C5, Firebird Trans Am, and Camaro SS/Z28 in 1998 and now powers what is likely one of the most in-depth garage builds we've seen yet. With only 91 octane pump-gas pumping through this car's fuel lines, it's producing upwards of 600 horsepower to the rear wheels, which sounds crazy until you start messing around with the type of gas. This American muscle car will make 840 horsepower to the rear wheels if run on race gas, showing how amazing an LS can be. It is clear that this car, and its owner, were meant to be together; everything about it is a testament to that.</p>
