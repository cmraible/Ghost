          "People will argue endlessly about whether a vehicle is a wagon or a shooting brake. We’ll leave that to those with pretenses and something to prove. What we know is wagons or shooting brakes aren’t the future of muscle cars, no matter what anyone on this or the European continent thinks. That was proven definitively with the Dodge Magnum. We’re not saying we didn’t like the thing, but it was not a roaring success. Now an artist has decided to push for this trend to catch on by turning Paul Walker’s 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429 into shooting brake."

Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if it had louvres? Even better would be to not create the rendering, but it’s done and saved to the internets now, so too late for that."

In other words, people don’t like anyone messing with the fundamental looks of a classic American muscle car. Who would’ve thought?"
