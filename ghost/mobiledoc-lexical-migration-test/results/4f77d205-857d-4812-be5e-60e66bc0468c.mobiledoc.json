That doesn’t justify street racing, but it does show an unintentional side effect of government shutdowns."

And there’s the problem of not everyone agreeing how far is too far. As the Osceola County Sheriff Marcos R. Lopez admitted during a news conference, there’s no way to prevent all crime or any loss of life from people racing on streets. It would be great if everyone thought about the fact on public roads there are others’ loved ones just trying to get where they’re going safely, maybe this wouldn’t happen. But street racers are inherently selfish as they speed around in traffic."
