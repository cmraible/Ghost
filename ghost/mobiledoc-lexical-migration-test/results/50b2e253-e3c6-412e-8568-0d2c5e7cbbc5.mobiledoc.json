The owner stated, “The car probably had about 3,000 miles on it, 2,500 of which are from me.” Most people who drove the car were often dissatisfied with the overall performance. A lot of the issues stemmed from a lack of comfort and the fact that the car was built mainly for racing, not for daily driving. The pedal box was too small making it impossible to drive without racing shoes, the car constantly scraped, and the interior was extremely driver-focused which is great for a race car but not for a rental."

When combined with beautiful styling, road presence, and supercar status makes this car extremely valuable."
