With fewer people on the job assembling cars, trucks, and SUVs, that will mean fewer new vehicles on the market and possibly inflated prices, which in turn affects the used car market. On the other hand, by paying workers more and offering increased benefits, moves which UAW says are necessary to compete in a tight labor market, GM might be forced to increase the price of new cars as operational expenses expand."

Manufacturing and shipping costs have also increased. All those additional expenses get rolled into the price of not only new cars but also replacement parts.

That expense is passed along to the consumer."

Not everyone who thinks used vehicle costs will come down is clear on if the change in prices will be sudden like a thunderclap or come as a slow deflation. Either way, people who have financed used cars under price inflation could find themselves upside down by a tremendous amount once the market settles back to normal. This is especially true for those who put little down when buying their vehicle and have made no moves to take a significant bite out of their loan. Why banks and other lenders have financed these sky-high prices instead of making consumers put more money down, which has ultimately enable much of the market inflation, is a question many are asking and rightfully so."

But sky-high prices have definitely help drive consumer behavior."
