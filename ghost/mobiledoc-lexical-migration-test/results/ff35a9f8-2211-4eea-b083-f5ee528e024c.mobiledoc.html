<p>According to the seller, this is a one-of-a-kind <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-love-mopars/">Mopar</a>. It has been inspected and verified by Galen Govier, a respected Mopar expert who agrees it is a one of one as equipped. The concours restoration really flaunts the Butterscotch or Bahama Yellow body, which contrasts nicely with the black vinyl roof, black hood, and bumble bee stripe with Super Bee decals. Completing the perfect look are the H-code black steel wheels with G70-15 Redline tires.</p>
