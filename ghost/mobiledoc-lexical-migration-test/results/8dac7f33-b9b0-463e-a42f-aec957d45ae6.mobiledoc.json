A recent announcement from Stellantis details out an electrification plan for the Brampton Assembly Plant, currently the home of the Dodge Challenger and Charger, plus the Chrysler 300. The announcement was made by Mark Stewart, Stellantis North America Chief Operating Officer, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford at his side."

They’ve consistently clobbered the Chevy Camaro and Ford Mustang in sales, like in 2021 when over 78,000 Chargers and over 54,000 Challengers were sold. But Stellantis believes whatever is coming down the pipe will be more popular."

If that’s the move, why would people choose a Dodge crossover versus a model that’s more established? Sadly, the strategy will probably be to load up on “attitude” with aggressive styling and a marketing campaign that tries convincing people they’re getting a “muscle crossover” or some such nonsense."
