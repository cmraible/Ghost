          "This beautiful classic Jaguar was given a nut and bolt restoration. The numbers-matching 3.8-liter drivetrain was fully rebuilt as well, and it was given new brakes, rebuilt carburetors, new chrome wheels, tires, and more. The exterior and forward chassis were all repainted in Carmen Red over a Biscuit Tan interior. Outside, it features a matching tan canvas soft top and boot cover. The exterior chrome was refinished and all weather stripping was redone. About 15 years ago, the interior was redone along with the sport seats being stripped and professionally reupholstered in respective vinyl and leather. The braking system was refurbished, and the suspension received new components. In May of 2017, the engine was rebuilt with no stone left unturned."

This car was bought in 1960 by its last owner. The original bill of sale is included from when it was first purchased in Portland, Oregon, along with the original Manufacturers Guarantee certificate. This car has never been taken apart and only features a single repaint that it was given decades ago. This is a numbers-matching car throughout. This classic runs and drives strong, and was the previous owner's pride and joy as it was garage-kept and meticulously maintained over its lifetime. This car hails from the southern states and has zero accidents on the record and no rust to be found."
