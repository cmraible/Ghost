<p>You’ll need to be a <a href="https://www.classiccarclub.org/grand_classics.html?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Classic Car Club of America</a> (CCCA) member to enter, and have a classic on the list of approved vehicles. CCCA defines eligible models as ‘fine or unusual motor cars which were built between and including the years 1915 to 1948. All of these are very special cars that are distinguished by their respective fine design, high engineering standards and superior workmanship.’ While entrants must be considered rare, they don’t need to be in perfect condition, with the Touring Class catering to cars that aren’t kept as trailer queens. You can find a complete list of approved vehicles <a href="https://www.classiccarclub.org/grand_classics/approved_classics_2019.html?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest judged event for the CCCA was back in 1953 at Washington Crossing Park in New Jersey. These prestigious judging events have evolved over time, but their high standards have never changed, leading to international recognition for these events. You can find out about CCCA’s history of judging cars <a href="https://www.classiccarclub.org/pdfs/History%20of%20Judging.pdf" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Love vintage cars but don’t own one yourself? You can still enjoy these Grand Classics events as a spectator and participate in various activities. These classics have been preserved for everyone to enjoy them.</p>
<p>The latest Grand Classics took place on 1 June 2019 in Michigan and was a huge success with some incredible cars on display. It’s well worth becoming a member of the CCCA and celebrating the classic you are a custodian of.</p>
