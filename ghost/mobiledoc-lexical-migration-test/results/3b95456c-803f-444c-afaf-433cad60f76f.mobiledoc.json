That’s according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, which released an arrest report from December 30, 2021 after one of its officers observed an allegedly illegal traffic stop on I-95."

Normally a Camaro wouldn’t be used by police, but there are some departments which use them for stealthier operations. This particular Chevy was reportedly left at Duval Ford, the dealership where Fernando Torres, the man accused of impersonating an officer, works."

What was supposed to be happening was that an employee was transporting the Camaro, which just had emergency lights installed on it. Of course, those lights were not to be operated by anyone other than a law enforcement officer, but the accusation is that Torres turned them on, pulling someone over."

That’s when the details about the Camaro not being driven by police was passed on. By the time the officer went back to the scene, the yellow muscle car and the other vehicle were both gone."

He refused to comment on the story when asked by a local reporter, saying his legal counsel advised against it. So far, he’s facing charges for impersonation of an official and unlawful sue of blue lights. Police are trying to track down the driver he pulled over to see if he might have committed any other crimes."
