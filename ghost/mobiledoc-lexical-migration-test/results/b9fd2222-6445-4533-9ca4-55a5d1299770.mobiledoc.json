          "One of the curiosities of Rétromobile 2019, held from February 6-10 in Paris, was the Berliet T100. This mastodon is a French truck designed in 1957 by Marius Berliet, but produced under the stewardship of his son Paul. The idea for the truck came about after an invite from Shell to visit the Saharan desert oil deposits turned into an invitation to design a machine suitable for the dunes. The result was the largest truck in the world."

The 6x4 configuration proved to be a failure, as the load on the rear tires destroyed them far too fast."

The first two went into disuse as the Algerians picked American suppliers for dune mobility, Berliet brought the fourth model back to Europe and destroyed it alongside the troublesome third model. That means there are two surviving, with one still somewhere in Algeria and the other based in France, hence its appearance at Rétromobile."
