          "These Tacomas were known for their reliability and the ability to rack up hundreds of thousands of miles, but this one has been driven less 23,000 over its 23 years – that means this '70 Taco' has only driven an average of 1,000 miles per year in its life! Not only is this mileage backed up on the vehicle history report, the overall condition of the Toyota is about as good as this truck looked when it was purchased by its first owner in October 1997. It's second owner definitely bought a great truck."

If not for the bright Cardinal Red paint job, this Tacoma might fly under the radar for most car collectors, but you can't deny this is a truly collectible Toyota with everything from the engine compartment to the undercarriage looking spotless. A lot of these trucks were heavily modified, but the only mods made to this Tacoma since 1997 appear to be a spray-in bedliner and a Pioneer cassette deck stereo."

The 4x4 system ensures that this truck will be able to conquer any terrain, but it doesn't appear this truck has ever seen a dirt road; even the manual-locking from hubs look like they've never been touched. The lack of scratches, dents and overall wear is a testament to how well this Toyota has been treated and maintained over the years."
