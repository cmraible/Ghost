<p>Hey, it's Friday. How did that happen so quickly? </p>
<h2 id="substack-is-a-publication-now">Substack is a publication now</h2>
<p>This is a great summary of <a href="https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so">the Substack problems</a> I alluded to yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>Except Substack is not merely an app. It’s actually a publication. Why do I say that? Because Substack’s leadership pays a secret, select group of people to write for the platform. They call this group of writers the “Substack Pro” group, and they are rewarded with “advances” that Substack co-founder <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">Hamish McKenzie calls</a> “an upfront sum to cover their first year on the platform [that’s] more attractive to a writer than a salary, so they don’t have to stay in a job (or take one) that’s less interesting to them than being independent.”</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>Substack’s business is a scam. They claim to offer writers a level playing field for making a living, and instead they pay an elite, secret group of writers to be on the platform and make newsletter writing appear to be more lucrative than it is.</blockquote>
<p>I'm still thinking about writing something about this, but I'm wondering if I really have anything to add to the debate…</p>

<ul>
    <li>🧳 The BBC is moving <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/18/bbc-to-relocate-400-jobs-outside-london">many, many news jobs out of London</a>. This is undeniably a good thing for the organisation and the country as a whole — but is equally undeniably brutal on the staff who face the tough choice between losing their job, or uprooting their lives to another part of the country. </li>
    <li>🧑🏼‍🍳 The <em>NYT</em> is giving up on <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/03/the-new-york-times-is-so-done-with-its-77000-member-facebook-cooking-group-what-happens-now/">a cookery group with over 77,000 members</a>. The problem is simple: it's not that you can't manage groups like this, is that you've got to set the tone much earlier, and probably pre-moderate all posts. They didn't, and it span out of control. </li>
    <li>🤦🏾‍♀️ New <em>Teen Vogue</em> editor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/media/teen-vogue-editor-alexi-mccammond.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes">won't actually start in her job after teenage racist tweets resurface</a>. Teenagers do stupid things. I certainly did. But certain types of teenage bad behaviour can hang around much longer now… and with more consequence. We're not in a forgiving place as an online culture at the moment.</li>
    <li>🕵🏻‍♂️ Some useful <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/03/new-resources-for-video-seo">technical details on video SEO</a>.</li>
    <li>🗞 No new statement from the Society of Editors yet — but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/14/press-body-faces-watershed-after-meghan-interview-row?utm_campaign=The%20Media%20Roundup%20from%20Media%20Voices&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">also none of the promised resignations</a>.
