<p>A willingness to experiment is one of the major things that will allow existing publishing businesses to survive the next few years, as technology reshapes the way information and entertainment are produced and distributed. And the ability to see new technology in the context of what you already do – but without being constrained by that context – is vital.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Colombo’s phone drawing is very much in the tradition of a certain kind of New Yorker cover, and he doesn’t see the fact that it’s a virtual finger painting as such a big deal. “Imagine twenty years ago, writing about these people who are sending these letters on their computer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the tradition, but also creating something new. Perfect.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
