I know there are many people who have children under less-than-ideal circumstances and who go on to have full and fulfilling lives. I also know that would not have been possible for me, and I unapologetically chose myself. Every word I have written, every story I have told, every ounce of joy I’ve experienced is because I had the ability to shape my life the way I wanted. As a journalist, I know we create the public record, and I want the record to show that abortion is freedom.”"

Cicilline to throw cold water on their own bipartisan antitrust bills: The American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act. The Chamber opportunistically seized on false claims made by Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) and Fox News host Laura Ingraham that antitrust reform is a way to ‘stop woke companies’ from standing up for LGBTQ+ rights. In a letter to Klobuchar and Cicilline, the lobbyists encouraged the lawmakers to denounce Buck’s claims. ‘If antitrust is used to punish companies for speaking up on social justice issues, the result could be a chilling effect on corporate leadership against hate and bigotry,’ the tech lobbyists wrote. That seems reasonable enough on its face, but it could not be more obvious that the Chamber’s goal was not to support LGBTQ+ rights, but rather to undermine legislation that their Big Tech backers oppose.” "

(We often hear about those driven by climate despair to forgo parenthood entirely.) And some examples do seem to support that thesis: At 28, Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer running on a climate-focused platform for a congressional seat in South Texas, is young, especially compared to her 66-year-old opponent and most of Congress. But many of these candidates are, like Alexis and Shrestha, in their thirties and forties: old enough to remember Al Gore connecting global warming to the heat waves, droughts, flash floods, and forest fires already ravaging the United States in the 1990s and desperate to protect their own and other families from the disasters we’re already experiencing and those yet to come.”"

At one end are the NatCons, post-liberals, and traditionalist figures like Benedict Option author Rod Dreher, who envision a conservatism reinvigorated by an embrace of localist values, religious identity, and an active role for the state in promoting everything from marriage to environmental conservation. But there’s also a highly online set of Substack writers, podcasters, and anonymous Twitter posters — ’our true intellectual elite,’ as one podcaster describes them. This group encompasses everyone from rich crypto bros and tech executives to back-to-the-landers to disaffected members of the American intellectual class, like Up in the Air author Walter Kirn, whose fulminations against groupthink and techno-authoritarianism have made him an unlikely champion to the dissident right and heterodox fringe. But they share a the basic worldview: that individualist liberal ideology, increasingly bureaucratic governments, and big tech are all combining into a world that is at once tyrannical, chaotic, and devoid of the systems of value and morality that give human life richness and meaning — as Blake Masters recently put it, a ‘dystopian hell-world.’”"

          "“Marc Andreessen — a pioneer of the web browser, a Facebook board member, and a top venture capitalist — is worth an estimated $1.7 billion. His VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz, controls billions more in capital and is a major force in guiding the next generation of well-heeled start-ups. Regularly lionized as a titan of the tech-mogul class, both an OG innovator and an astute investor, Andreessen is helping to lead the web3 charge as his firm plunks down billions on crypto companies. He seems to live well: In the last six-plus months, he’s spent $255 million on three homes in Malibu. He ticks some of the other popularity metrics: a million Twitter followers, a regular on the conference and speaking circuit, a member of the Internet Hall of Fame. He’s donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Republicans, and he has the ear of fellow billionaires including Elon Musk. Andreessen is a big deal — a tech, business, and political power player — in whatever sense that still matters. For Andreessen, it doesn’t seem to matter all that much. This putative titan of industry has spent the past week tweeting about how he and some of his fellow billionaires are less powerful than one might think.” "

What was striking in the earnings calls was not the supply chain shortages or companies’ typical profit motives; it was the plain old corporate profiteering. The Economics 101 adage that ‘inflation is just too much money chasing too few goods’ doesn’t come close to the full story. This raises the question: When companies are exploiting consumers in a time of national crisis, when should government step in?”"
