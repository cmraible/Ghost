Sure, some people love that, but it really gets in the way of just hopping on and enjoying the purity of the riding experience, of feeling connected to the bike. There’s no way to check your text messages, switch riding modes, or mess with anything else digital while riding. This could be the way to enjoy that connected experience without turning to an actual vintage motorcycle."
