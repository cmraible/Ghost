<p>Reader Chris writes to point out that I was a little vague on one point in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2023/01/why-newsletters-are-just-getting-started/">my newsletter interview with Ian Silvera</a>:</p>
<blockquote>You were non-committal about Ghost v Beehiv but the funding issues round Beehiv appeared from your brief mention to be similarly VC-backed to Substack. Does that mean Ghost might be safer bet?</blockquote>
<p>As always, it depends. They're quite different products at this point. </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://ghost.org"><strong>Ghost</strong></a> is a strong web publishing tool that is also an extremely capable newsletter platform. It's open source, self-sustaining and not VC-backed. It has a lovely, clean interface that is very easy to use.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com"><strong>Beehiiv</strong></a> is a newsletter powerhouse. Logging in and wandering around the Beehiiv interface is a bit like finding yourself at the controls of a complex aircraft. There's a whole bunch of powerful list and revnue development tools here ‚Äî but you need some skill to deploy them well. All this power comes at the price of a more confusing UI and weaker website functionality. </li>
</ul>
<p>My personal wariness of VC-backed platforms biases me towards Ghost ‚Äî but I'd suggest taking a long hard look at both platforms. Ghost would be a better call if you're launching a newsletter/website combo, while Beehiiv is probably a better call if you want to develop nothing but a newsletter, and want every tool under the sun at your disposal. </p>

<p>US correspondant JoLynne write to point out that sometimes the work of local press is seriously under-estimated. As she puts it:</p>
<blockquote>George Santos lied about just about everything on his resum√© to get elected to the US House of Representatives. The <em>New York Times</em> did an investigation that revealed his lies, but only after he was elected. At the time, the big question on Twitter was how so many big lies could have gone undetected for so long.</blockquote>
<p>Good question! Did nobody have any suspicions?</p>
<blockquote>Turns out, a small local paper did the work before the election, but not enough people noticed.</blockquote>

<p>This happens far too often, and there's so little excuse for it in the digital age. Often local press ‚Äî or B2B ‚Äî genuinely break a story, but all the credit accumulates to the mainstream outlet that puts it in front of more people‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And on yesterday's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2023/01/four-things-publishers-should-give-up-in-2023/">warnings about TikTok</a>, she points out that she lives in a state where public bodies are banning the app on work phones. Some organisations are stull using the platform but their staff have to record and edit on their personal devices.</p>
<blockquote>I think some would like to attribute this policy to right-wing censorship. FWIW I think there‚Äôs more to it than that.</blockquote>
