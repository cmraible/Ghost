          "Comedian Kevin Hart is quite the car guy, although many gearheads and even normies are keenly aware of the unfortunate accident back in September of 2019. That crash left Menace, a 1970 Plymouth ‘Cuda modified by Speedkore, in absolute shambles and landed Hart in the hospital. Since then, the man has recovered from the wreck and is back at work. He’s also purchased a number of enviable rides recently, including the first Ferrari SF90 Spider to be sold in the United States."

Behind the wheel was his wife’s trainer’s fiancé, and ultimately an official investigation into the accident cited driver recklessness as the cause. Still, Hart has been observed behaving badly behind the wheel since recovering from the crash, including reports of him allegedly texting and driving in a classic Ford Mustang, swerving around in highway traffic."
