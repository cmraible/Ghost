<p>In the past year and a half we’ve watched countless long-standing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/automotive-events-canceled-2021/">events canceled</a> thanks to covid mitigation efforts. Finally, we’re seeing not only at least some of those <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/motorious-at-pebble-beach/">gatherings come back</a> but also the emergence of new automotive events. The first-ever American Speed Festival starts today, September 30 and runs through October 3, giving fans of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/historic-drag-race-car-collection/">historic motorsports</a> plenty of thrills.</p>
<p><em>Learn all about what happened to the racetrack at Disney World <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/walt-disney-world-speedway/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The inaugural event takes place at the M1 Concourse and 1.5-mile track in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pontiac-museum-could-open/">Pontiac, Michigan</a>. If you’re in the area this weekend, it should be a good time. After all, there will be plenty of famous race cars in attendance, with 1960s and 1970s Can-Am race cars getting a special tribute.</p>

<p>One of the premier cars being shown off at ASF is a 1952 Hudson Hornet which is the only surviving Fabulous Hornet race car. Kids will know the legend from the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/walt-disney-world-speedway/">Disney movie <em>Cars</em></a>, but adult racing fans will remember it absolutely dominated NASCAR races from 1951 to 1954.</p>
<p>Other vehicles being displayed either on the track or off include a 1969 Ford Mustang R-Code Cobra Jet, an original prototype car which was raced in the 24 Hours of Daytona back in 1975. Fans will also be treated to seeing a 1970 TRC Ti 22 MKII Can-Am, which went toe-to-toe with McLaren back in the day.</p>

<p>During the weekend events, Jim Hall, who was both a driver and car designer, will be honored with ASF’s first Master of Motorsports award. Hall will be displaying several cars from his museum, which is located in Texas, providing attendees with examples of how design innovations and high-flying performance made Can-Am wildly influential and a favorite of the fans, like the Chaparral 2, 2E, 2F, and 2K.</p>
<p>Hall’s not the only racing legend who will be in attendance. David Hobbs, former driver and motorsports analyst will be there. Bobby Rahal, a three-time CART champion, Indy 500 winner, and team owner will also be part of the festivities.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yiV3wi2UrKQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
