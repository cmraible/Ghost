<p>Disconcerting news this evening. <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2015/01/28/a-note-to-my-readers/">Andrew Sullivan is quitting blogging</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The second is that I am saturated in digital life and I want to return to the actual world again. I’m a human being before I am a writer; and a writer before I am a blogger, and although it’s been a joy and a privilege to have helped pioneer a genuinely new form of writing, I yearn for other, older forms. I want to read again, slowly, carefully. I want to absorb a difficult book and walk around in my own thoughts with it for a while. I want to have an idea and let it slowly take shape, rather than be instantly blogged. I want to write long essays that can answer more deeply and subtly the many questions that the Dish years have presented to me. I want to write a book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sullivan has blogged at an almost frenzied level for a decade and a half. I suspect that he’s not capable of blogging at a more relaxed pace, even with a team around him. If it’s all or nothing, it sounds like it needs to be nothing – and that’s good for him and his family, even if it’s a loss for us.</p>
<p>Sullivan was blogging years before I started, and has been a profound influence on me from very early on. I always kinda assumed that he’d be there long after I hung up the keyboard – but that doesn’t seem to be the case now. A world without Sullivan blogging seems like an odd one.</p>
<p>I hope The Dish will outlive his blogging life. His recent holidays have proved that his team are capable of keeping it going while he was away. I suspect that there’s a viable business there even without Sullivan at the helm, leading from the front. But we’ll see if that’s something he wants.</p>
<p>So, thanks for the last 15 years, Andrew, and the best of luck with all the rest of the things you want to do.</p>
<h2 id="deathofblogging">Death of blogging?</h2>
<p>The one thing that this isn’t is any sign of the “death of blogging”. You only have to glance a Tumblr and the growth in fashion blogging and the explosion of Medium and all the rest of it to see that, as Kevin Marks wrote <em>in 2008</em>, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/bloggings-not-dead-its-becoming-like.html">blogging is like air</a>.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, <em>blogging won</em>. Everything from your Facebook newsfeed to a Pinterest board has something of the characteristics of the medium. Blogging is so deeply entwined with the web itself that we don’t even really need the word any more.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
