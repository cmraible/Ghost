<hr>
<p>In 1999. <a href="https://www.broadarrowauctions.com/vehicles/po23_003/1999-porsche-911-classic-club-coupe">the Porsche 911</a> was the top of the top when it came to European Sports cars. Some of these models even pushed the limits of what could be considered a sports car rather than a supercar with massive amounts of power and racing heritage to back it up. Unlike pretty much anything else built to the time, it was all about low-slung body lands and suspension tuned specifically for great handling performance. It's no wonder these vehicles became the symbols of class and skill in the United States while over in Germany they were viewed much in the same way we see our Corvettes here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.broadarrowauctions.com/vehicles/po23_003/1999-porsche-911-classic-club-coupe">This particular 911</a> is a classic Club Coupe and stands out a lot in terms of its exterior styling as well as the performance package beneath it. First of all, it's an automobile labeled as a Sonderwunsch, or in English "special request." That means that this is chassis number one of one and features design cues from Grant Larson and the Porsche Club of America. Even the paint color was pretty much unheard of at the time, labeled sport gray light and also featuring thin border stripes. Indeed, the exterior would suggest this is an incredible collector's car and like pretty much anything out there on the automotive market.</p>

<p>However, it certainly wasn't only made to impress with its body lines as the water-cooled flat-six sitting behind the rear axle should tell you. This Powerhouse was capable of producing 381 horsepower in its day which would have been more than just fun as you rocketed up to 8000 RPM. On top of that, power is then transferred through a six-speed manual transmission making this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/modern-too-damn-fat/">911</a> one of the most engaging vehicles she had to offer at the time. Tying everything together was a 911 GT3 suspension and braking system that made handling a breeze on the racing track. All of these things make this 911 one of a kind which is exactly why you should consider adding the car to your collection.</p>
