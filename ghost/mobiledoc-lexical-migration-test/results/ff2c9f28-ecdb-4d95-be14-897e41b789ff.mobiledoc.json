However, dealerships might take longer to budge, in part because they don’t immediately turn around and sell vehicles purchased at auction. Some might try to hold out on pricing for cars they paid dearly to obtain, particularly those which dealers purchased straight from customers while supply was incredibly tight a couple of months ago. It’s understandable these businesses don’t want to take a huge loss, but that’s one of the many risks involved with sudden price inflation and the inevitable drop-off."

The publication cites a drop in wholesale car prices between May and June, echoing others’ perceptions of where the market is headed at this point. But the real question is how long will it take for prices to return to 2019 levels? Ivan Drury, who is senior manager of insights at Edmunds, told Business Insider consumers should see prices return to normal in 6 months or longer. In other words, we could be in for a rough ride."
