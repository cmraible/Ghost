Whether it is because of the cars which dominated racing in the 1950s and '60s or the video game that got many of us into vehicles, the GT name holds a lot of weight in car culture. Sports car and supercar manufacturers understand this all too well and, as such, have produced many incredible vehicles which wear that moniker. "

This is relatively new for a performance car like itself and may even be the perfect opportunity to get behind the wheel of an excellent sports car without paying the price of a brand new example. With only 38,000 miles on the odometer, it's clear that, while it has undoubtedly experienced a healthy amount of driving, it won't break the bank with repair costs or maintenance. Most supercar owners may not need to be concerned with prices like that but what they are most certainly focused on is performance."

Powering this masterpiece of Italian design is a 4.7-liter V8 engine that rolled off the Ferrari production line when it was new.

All of the power produced by that V8 is sent to a set of 20\" wheels which provide the car with a sleek black color contrasting the white body.
