The twist is this grille has been divided into two kidneys, a familiar quality to BMW enthusiasts. In fact, one could argue whether or not it’s more stylish than some of the newly-revealed Bimmer production cars’ grilles. We think it is, thanks to the throw-back feel in the mix."

While not built for flat-out speed, that engine sits low to the ground, meaning a lower center of gravity for better handling, so it should still be a fun bike to ride in urban areas where maneuverability is of high importance."
