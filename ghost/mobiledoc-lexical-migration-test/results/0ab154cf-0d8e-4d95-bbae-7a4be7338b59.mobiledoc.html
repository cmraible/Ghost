<h2 id="the-quartz-market">The Quartz market</h2>
<p>Last week, as I was preparing my materials for the <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/vocational-skills-study/creating-compelling-newsletters-online-course/s43/a761215/">new newsletter course</a> I'm leading, I found myself looking at that morning's <em>Quartz</em> daily brief — and realising that it was a shadow of its former self. The key characterstics that made it such a compelling reading in the early 2010s had been lost somewhere along the way, so I dug a 2013 edition out of my archives and used that instead.</p>
<p>That, in a nutshell, is the problem with the current <em>Quartz</em>: it's stuck in the trough of irrelevancy that too many publications fall into and die. It doesn't have enough scale to be a true attention trawler, gathering big enough volumes of people to monetise easily. But equally, it is no longer in a clearly defined niche, that people find compelling. Its ruthless focus on the role that it played iun the business community's day has been diluted, and so, it's much harder to understand <em>why</em> you should read — or subscribe to — <em>Quartz</em>.</p>
<p>Making a decision one way or another on scale versus niche will be critical to the survival of the title (and I'm <a href="https://www.amediaoperator.com/p/quartz-going-independent-again-now?r=2hwy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=copy">not alone in thinking that</a>). That's the challenge for the aging innovator, which is under new ownership: its CEO and editor-in-chief:</p>

<p>Yes, it's a management buy-out, with a hunt for additional investment underway. Right now, the plan is to stick with the membership model:</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Seward said there were no plans to alter the site’s current business model.</blockquote>
<p>In which case, the future of <em>Quartz</em> will be decided by their content and engagement strategy. I remain hopeful. I was a huge fan of the early years of <em>Quartz</em>, and perhaps the return to private ownership will encourage them to do less “me too” content, and more innovative experiments, like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/10/social-digital-coffee-break-escaping-the-facebook-shadow/">the urban fiction I mentioned</a> a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p>Their manifesto is promising:</p>
