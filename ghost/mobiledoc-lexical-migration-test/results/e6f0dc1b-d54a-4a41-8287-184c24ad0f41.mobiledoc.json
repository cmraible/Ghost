Those are of course impressive figures, but even more amazing is the 2,174-pound curb weight. You won’t get any speed or acceleration stats from the company, which seems to know it made a damn fast/quick hypercar it doesn’t have to brag about."

That explains everything from the massive front splitter to the roof intake, towering rear wing and those vicious-looking canards. It’s so good, Murray decided to put Niki Lauda’s name on the T.50 S."
