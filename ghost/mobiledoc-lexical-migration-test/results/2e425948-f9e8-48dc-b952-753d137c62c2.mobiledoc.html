<hr>
<p>Unearthing a collection of classic cars and rescuing them from a rotting fate is a dream opportunity for most automotive enthusiasts, and that's exactly what this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1937-mg-ta/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1937 MG TA</a> represents. It was part of a sizable barn find collection that was recently discovered collecting dust in Florida, and were sold off to new homes on <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Bring A Trailer</a>. Like its barn find brethren, this incredibly original MG was up for auction with no reserve, and it ended up selling for $15,500.</p>

<p>The popularity of these old MGs is obvious by the fact that replica versions were produced in the 1970s and 1980s, but this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1937-mg-ta/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1937 MG TA</a> being auctioned off is no replica. Not only is it a legit MG, but it's also an early version of the TA. These pre-war cars were built from 1936 until 1939, and unlike the later TC and TD models, you don't see many examples of the TA in the U.S.</p>
<p>Sadly, after years of sitting, this TA isn't in running shape, but it appears that the body and interior are pretty solid. The listing says that the car's 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine is locked up, and documented receipts show that this car last received major engine work in 1966. Other past work documented on this car includes a repaint in 1969 and a reupholstered interior in 1973. Overall, this is a complete car that will require a complete restoration, but once it's back on the road, it will be exciting to show off.</p>
<p>If not for vintage British roadsters like the MG TA, there's a good chance that the world wouldn't have classics like the Jaguar E-Type or even the modern classic Mazda Miata, so this legitimate 1937 MG TA barn find would make for a unique restoration project.</p>
