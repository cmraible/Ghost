<p>From Mississippi to Massachusetts, this week <em>The Lever </em>revealed how some of the country’s most basic infrastructure — our water systems and electric grids — are being used by Wall Street and investors as their own personal ATM machines, threatening people’s ability to use their own tap water and build environmentally resilient infrastructure.</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em> team also revealed how the GOP is keeping citizen initiatives off ballots, crushing popular demand for higher taxes on the wealthy and expanded public health insurance. Also, we uncovered a last-minute dark money campaign with ties to Saudi operatives, revealed how GOP governors are raising money off migrant abuse, and exposed how a “charitable” chef is suppressing worker pay. </p>
