<p>You may have heard of some pretty crazy stories about classic cars found in a barn after a couple of years. Maybe the odd 40 year old cruiser has crossed your path. However, itâ€™s not every day that we get to witness a vehicle pulled from a storage area after 60 years of sitting. Well, thatâ€™s exactly what happened with this enthusiast when he took the opportunity of a lifetime and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hudson-pacemaker-barn-find/">bought a Hudson</a>.</p>

<p>While itâ€™s not clear of the exact date the car was assembled, it is a 1936 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/this-is-not-just-any-doc-hudson-replica/">Hudson</a> Terraplane. That tells the host a very important piece of information about this car, itâ€™s really old. In fact, these vehicles were pretty popular back on their day with well over 100,000 cars sold in 1936. A lot of those were Terraplanes. So why is it that everyone in the comments seems to think this is an incredibly rare vehicle?</p>

<p>First of all, that was 87 years ago so most of these cars were straight up crashed, rotted out, or scrapped. On top of that, this one is a sedan so only so many of the Terraplane were built. Not to mention, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-lenos-1951-hudson-hornet-has-quite-the-history/">Hudson</a> is sort of a legend within the car community for producing some really interesting models. The brand isnâ€™t around anymore so any Hudson is a rare one. With all of that in mind, itâ€™s easy to see how special this vehicle really is.</p>
