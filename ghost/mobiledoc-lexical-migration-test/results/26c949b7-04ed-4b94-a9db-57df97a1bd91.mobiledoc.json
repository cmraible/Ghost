          ". If you own classic cars, work on your vehicles, or are the least bit concerned about fire risk at your own home, it’s wise to invest in an automatic fire suppression system for your garage. While not cheap, they’re certainly worth avoiding serious damage or possible loss of life. In this instance, such a system would’ve prevented the estimated $1 million in property damage, not to mention the loss of vehicles with high sentimental value for the family."
