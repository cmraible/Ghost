You’ll note in the pictures the details look pretty refined and that’s obviously why."

There are a few modifications which push it to that level, like race valve guides, a big valve head assembly, and 78-degree camshaft. A 71B 5-speed manual transmission has been swapped in. Wilwood disc brakes have been swapped in at the front wheels."

Amazingly, the claim is all the brightwork on the exterior and the glass is all in original condition, with the exception of the windshield, so this car has likely lived a pampered life. Making a strong statement is the BRE-style air dam up front and a Super Sonic front grille."
