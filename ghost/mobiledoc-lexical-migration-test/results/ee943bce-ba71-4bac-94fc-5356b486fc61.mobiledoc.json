Ken Block’s Hoonicorn has a 6.7-liter Methanol-fed twin-turbo V8 that revs to 8,600rpm mated to a 6-speed sequential transmission putting down 1,400 horsepower to the signature style wheels and AWD. In comparison to the RWD Ecoboost V6 of the GT giving out just around 647 horsepower and 550ft/lbs of torque, the transmission is a 7-speed automatic which may be the GT’s only advantage over the Hoonicorn."

As a result, the GT lost by a full 3 seconds. After the GT’s loss, the team decided to do a roll race for round 2. The Hoonicorn came in the first place but the GT40 did get closer to winning due to it being able to pick up its pace toward the end of the race. Hoonicorn was declared the official winner and the Bonus round was begun."
