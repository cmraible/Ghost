<p>Good things are happening! The U.S. is finally taking action to phase out super-pollutants, New York becomes the next state to phase out gas-powered vehicles, and California is rolling out new policies to transition away from natural gas in homes. Also, a referendum in Cuba has redefined rights for families, while farmworkers have just won historic labor protections.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week‚Äôs edition of <em>You Love To See It</em>, available below.</p>
<h3 id="us-eliminates-super-pollutants">U.S. Eliminates Super-Pollutants</h3>
<p>Last week, the Senate <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/20/1123433566/hydrofluorocarbons-banned-us">ratified</a> an international climate agreement ‚Äî the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=XXVII-2-f&chapter=27&clang=_en">Kigali Amendment</a> to the <a href="https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol">Montreal Protocol</a> ‚Äî designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</p>
<p>HFCs are chemicals that leak from cooling appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners. HFCS can be thousands of times <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/watertrain/moduleFrame.cfm?parent_object_id=2424">more harmful</a> than carbon dioxide in terms of heating the planet. Cutting their use could prevent half a degree Celsius of global warming by the end of the century, a vital step when every tenth of a degree matters. </p>
<p>The Kigali Amendment was being <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/20/1123433566/hydrofluorocarbons-banned-us">negotiated</a> by countries participating in the Montreal Protocol in 2016, but President Trump never sent the amendment to the Senate. However, in December 2020, Congress <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/22/949213763/climate-action-for-christmas-omnibus-bill-includes-biggest-policy-shift-in-years">passed</a> the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, which empowered the Environmental Protection Agency to phase out 85 percent of HFCs over 15 years. Now that target will be increased to 100 percent of these super-pollutants.</p>
<h3 id="new-york-bars-gas-guzzlers">New York Bars Gas Guzzlers</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>New York will ban the sale of all gas-powered vehicles by 2035, state Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/3666954-new-york-to-mandate-zero-emission-vehicles-in-2035/">announced</a> Thursday. The move makes the Empire State the second state to mandate zero-emission vehicles, after California <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-a-clean-energy-future-might-not-be-far-away/">enacted a similar mandate</a> last month.</p>
<p>To reach its goal, New York will require 35 percent of new car sales to be zero emission vehicles by 2026, and 68 percent zero emission by 2030. All new school buses purchased by the state will also have to be zero emission starting in 2027.</p>
<p>With California and New York boasting <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-state">two of the three largest state economies</a> in the country, these mandates will likely have a major impact on the car and truck industries. Together, the two states account for <a href="https://knoema.com/atlas/United-States-of-America/ranks/Car-sales">nearly 18 percent</a> of all U.S. car sales.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe had to wait for California to take a step because there‚Äôs some federal requirements that California had to go first ‚Äî that‚Äôs the only time we‚Äôre letting them go first,‚Äù said Hochul, after arriving at the press conference in a zero-emission Chevy Bolt.</p>
<h3 id="california-bans-new-gas-heaters">California Bans New Gas Heaters</h3>
<p>California regulators voted <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/california-could-ban-new-gas-heaters-after-2030-the-goal-healthier-air">unanimously</a> to become the first state in the country to ban the sale of gas-powered heating and hot water systems by 2030. Indoor fossil fuel use accounts for 12 percent of the country‚Äôs fossil fuel emissions. According to decarbonization researcher Denise Grab, ‚Äú[in California] gas appliances emit four times more emissions than all of the state‚Äôs power plants put together, and nearly two-thirds of the emissions of all light-duty cars.‚Äù</p>

<p>This <a href="https://grist.org/buildings/californias-2030-ban-on-gas-heaters-opens-a-new-front-in-the-war-on-fossil-fuels/">new ban</a> will join the increasing number of California <a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2022/california-ends-gas-line-subsidies-as-it-eyes-an-electric-future">state</a><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/california-takes-bold-steps-to-make-electricity-the-fuel-of-choice-for-new-buildings">policies</a> facilitating a transition to climate-friendly building codes and appliances like <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/2022_State_SIP_Strategy.pdf">heat pumps</a>, which deliver more energy-efficient means of heating and cooling homes.</p>
<p>The unfolding transition will have numerous benefits for health and living costs, especially in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/climate/air-pollution-minorities.html">communities</a> with lower incomes. Regulators in the <a href="https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/dotgov/files/rules/reg-9-rule-4-nitrogen-oxides-from-fan-type-residential-central-furnaces/2021-amendments/documents/20210930_01_wsr_rules0904and0906-pdf.pdf?la=en">San Francisco Bay Area</a> and <a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/clean-air-plans/air-quality-management-plans/2022-air-quality-management-plan/draft2022aqmp.pdf?sfvrsn=12">Los Angeles</a> are projecting serious health improvements thanks to improved air quality from zero-emission heating. Moreover, electric heat pumps can regulate temperatures more efficiently than air conditioners or gas-powered appliances, lowering long-term energy costs .</p>
<h3 id="cuba-adopts-a-progressive-families-code">Cuba Adopts A Progressive Families Code</h3>
<p>This week, Cuba voted to adopt a <a href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2022/09/26/cubans-just-ratified-the-worlds-most-progressive-family-code/">new Families Code</a> that guarantees the right of all people to form a family without discrimination.</p>
<p>Redefining how people can come together to form a family unit, the <a href="https://en.granma.cu/cuba/2022-05-19/families-plural">act states</a>, ‚ÄúDifferent family structures, based on a relationship of affection, are created among relatives, whatever the nature of the relationship, and between spouses or in common-law unions.‚Äù Under the act, people perform ‚Äúfamily and societal duties on the basis of love, affection, consideration, solidarity, fraternity, co-participation, protection, responsibility, and mutual respect.‚Äù</p>
<p>The new Families Code was won by a tremendous democratic process that involved 75 percent of Cuba‚Äôs electorate. According to <em>Progressive International</em>, 20 drafts of the law were shaped by nearly 80,000 neighborhood meetings and 500,000 public proposals before 66 percent of voters <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ProgIntl/status/1574463014107058181">passed the codes</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe family code is the result of a collective endeavor,‚Äù Yamila Gonzalez of the Families Code Drafting Committee <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/26/unprecedented-democratic-exercise-cubans-approve-inclusive-family-code">told</a><em>Common Dreams</em>. ‚ÄúAll of those perspectives have resulted in a code that responds to the needs of Cuban families... At a time when we are witnessing the rollback of fundamental rights for women in the LGBTQ+ community, Cuba is guaranteeing all rights for all people at the family level.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="farmworkers-win-historic-labor-protections">Farmworkers Win Historic Labor Protections</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article264940744.html">marching</a> 335 miles to the California state capital, the <a href="https://ufw.org/">United Farm Workers</a> (UFW) and their supporters pushed Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign the Voting Choice Act, a <a href="https://act.seiu.org/a/33122petition?ms=w">bill</a> that will allow workers to vote for unionization free from intimidation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is an incredible victory. Starting next year, farm workers can participate in elections free from intimidation and deportation. S√≠, se puede,‚Äù Teresa Romero, president of the UFW, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/UFWupdates/status/1575251269685420033">statement</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>The UFW‚Äôs march brought together <a href="https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/the-united-farm-workers-march-to-the-california-state-capitol/">thousands</a> of supporters in an effort that has now won vital protections from large agricultural associations and wealthy ranchers. Decades ago, labor and civil rights activists Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez led a similar march on the capital known as the pilgrimage, or the peregrinaci√≥n. For many leaders of this summer‚Äôs march, the Voting Choice Act represents a step toward <a href="https://calaborfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AB-2183-Stone-Governor-Request-for-Signature-Sign-On-Letter-w-Latino-Leaders.pdf">restoring</a> and transforming the country‚Äôs commitment to the rights of farmworkers.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Wendell Berry‚Äôs poem about anger and gentleness, ‚Äú<a href="https://mbird.com/poetry/a-warning-to-my-readers-wendell-berry/">A Warning To My Readers</a>‚Äù:</p>
<p><em>Do not think me gentle</em></p>
<p><em>because I speak in praise</em></p>
<p><em>of gentleness, or elegant</em></p>
<p><em>because I honor the grace</em></p>
<p><em>that keeps this world. I am</em></p>
<p><em>a man crude as any,</em></p>
<p><em>gross of speech, intolerant,</em></p>
<p><em>stubborn, angry, full</em></p>
<p><em>of fits and furies. That I</em></p>
<p><em>may have spoken well</em></p>
<p><em>at times, is not natural.</em></p>
<p><em>A wonder is what it is.</em></p>
