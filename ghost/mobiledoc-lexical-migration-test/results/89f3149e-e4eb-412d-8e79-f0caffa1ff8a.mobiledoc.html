<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/GR+Auto+Gallery">GR Auto Gallery</a> is pleased to announce this unique <a href="https://www.grautogallery.com/vehicles/7816/1933-essex-terraplane-pickup">1933 Essex Terraplane pickup</a> for sale. The Terraplane was a model built by the Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, between 1932 and 1938. In its first years, the car was branded as the Essex-Terraplane; in 1934, the car simply became known as the Terraplane. These vehicles were inexpensive, yet powerful and used in both town and country applications–both cars and trucks bore the name.</p>
<p>In 1933, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=essex">Essex</a> produced 430 commercial vehicles; this is believed to be the only remaining pick-up example. The one you see being offered here was treated to two frame-off restorations with documentation of both processes. This 1933 Essex Terraplane is powered by a rebuilt 327 cubic-inch V8 engine that is mated to a Muncie four-speed manual transmission. All the power is sent to the rear wheels via a Mustang rear end with 3.73 gear ratios.</p>

<p>After the first restoration, this pickup was painted black. The most recent restoration, however, had the frame and all body components removed; everything was then painted in the current pale green color. Describing this color is extremely difficult as it is really unique and hugs every curve of this Essex <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=terraplane">Terraplane</a> with grace. It may be a pale hue of green, but it’s still eye-catching, nonetheless.  The exterior features a bed cover that has hydraulic supports, as well as a bed-mounted gas tank. There is also a gas filler on the exterior of the bed, though that is purely for looks and is not operational.</p>
<p>The interior features a cast-iron steering wheel that is unlike anything else. It’s safe to say that it’s the first thing occupants notice when getting into this 1933 Essex Terraplane. It really helps to set this classic apart from the rest. The cabin also includes a JVC radio with Bluetooth capabilities and custom aftermarket audio system. All gauges are original and have been refinished, except for the oil and water gauges located above the windshield.</p>
