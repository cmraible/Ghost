However, you have to admit some low-tech solutions and designs are better than the ostensibly superior high-tech options, since those can create more problems than they solve. In other words, while you can laugh at Ludacris and mock the man, he’s done what so many others have. The sad truth is as this becomes even more common, we all end up paying the price with higher insurance rates and maybe other high-tech “solutions” to fix the problems caused by rushed, ill-planned technologies."
