That they can use special “keylogger” software to capture everything you’re typing, including your credit card details while you’re online shopping? Sophos Home Premium stops these invasions of privacy in their tracks. The product will alert you when an outside source is attempting to access your webcam or mic, giving you the option to allow or block the action. And, Sophos Home Premium will also encrypt your keystrokes so cybercriminals and key-logger software can’t capture what you’re typing. It’s additional layers of protection to ensure your privacy remains intact."
