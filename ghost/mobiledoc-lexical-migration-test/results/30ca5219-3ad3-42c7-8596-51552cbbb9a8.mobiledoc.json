It wasn’t, however, a car in concours or showroom condition, which was the other part of the project. Since it was in terrible condition, it was gifted to Tim Jr. as a father-son project."

The restoration was so good, Tim Jr. brought home a trophy for finishing in the top 20 at a car show - proving that this final result was a very impressive car."
