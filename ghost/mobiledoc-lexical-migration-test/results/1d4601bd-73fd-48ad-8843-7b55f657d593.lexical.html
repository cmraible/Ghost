<p>Uber had “kill switches” that would block regulators’ access to the app when it was being investigated and to the company’s computers when they were raided by police from 2014 to 2017. Called “Greyball,” the program was originally created as a fraud prevention program, but Uber then turned it against governments around the world. The company used it to ensure that company computers would go dark upon a raid, and that when an investigator was attempting to use the Uber app as part of their investigations, they would see no available cars.</p>
<p>Further information about Greyball, which was originally disclosed in 2017, was revealed when Uber’s former top lobbyist for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions sent more than 83,000 additional documents about the program to<em> The Guardian.</em> Among the revelations: that former Obama campaign manager and then-Uber senior executive David Plouffe was aware of the program. Uber executives’ nickname for Greyball was “Fake View.”</p>
<p><em>The</em><em>Washington Post, </em>in conjunction with <em>The</em><em>Guardian </em>and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, reported that one European Uber executive wrote in a 2014 email: “It feels to me like greyballing is better than banning, as the greyball user is likely to think that there’s just no supply out there (as opposed to being banned, or not seeing the view at all).” We highlight their outstanding reporting below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/07/unimaginable-abortion-stories-will-become-more-common-is-american-journalism-ready/"><strong>• Unimaginable Abortion Stories Will Become More Common. Is American Journalism Ready?</strong></a><em><strong></strong>(</em>Columbia Journalism Review<em>) — “In America after the end of </em>Roe v. Wade<em>, one brave source on the record in the final story will often be the best we can get. Obviously, reporters and editors must make sure that their reporting is accurate and true! But those who believe that the end of legal abortion in many states is newsworthy will need to figure out how to report and publish these stories with a few more constraints than they’d prefer. If performing or receiving an abortion now counts as activism, well, then journalists will need to be okay quoting ‘activists,’ unless they only want to tell the anti-abortion movement’s side.”</em></p>
