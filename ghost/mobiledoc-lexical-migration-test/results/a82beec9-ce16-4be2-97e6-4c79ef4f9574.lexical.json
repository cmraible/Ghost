This particular Demon makes its presence known by sporting one of the most flamboyant colors that the car was offered in. Taking things up a notch, the Demon yawns at the 707 horsepower of the Hellcat while itself makes an insane 840-horsepower when equipped with the one-dollar optional Demon crate. Another thing that makes the Demon so popular is the fact that Dodge was able to push the car to a 9.65-second quarter-mile.",

If you think about it, who would have ever thought that a large portion of the remaining cars from the 1970s would have fuel injection, independent suspension, and rack and pinion steering and yet at the same time it is very fitting that a restorer would want to add the best features of the modern world to their favorite classic body style.",
