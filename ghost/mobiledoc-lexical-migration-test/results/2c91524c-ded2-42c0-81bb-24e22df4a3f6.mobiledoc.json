Of course, anyone who thinks that is completely wrong."

Fox 2.5 x 10 coil-over remote reservoir emulsion shocks and 37-inch BFG mud terrain tires add further to the rugged, capable nature of this truck. An on-board ARB compressor allows you to reinflate those tires after airing down. That setup is even more amazing since it’s paired with Hellcat power plus a 4L80 transmission. In the unlikely event you do get stuck, there’s a Warn winch mounted on the front bumper."

During that time it’s established a nice reputation for chassis fabrication, which is showcased nicely on this Hellcat Power Wagon build. As you probably already gathered, they work on trucks, but they also focus on muscle cars, street rods, off-roaders, classics, and custom jobs. Even more impressive, these guys do all their work in house."
