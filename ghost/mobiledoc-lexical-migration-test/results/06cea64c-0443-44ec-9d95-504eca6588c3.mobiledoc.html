<hr>
<p>With an incredibly sleek and aerodynamic body and <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2002-aston-martin-vanquish-6/">Aston Martin's</a> most powerful V12 engine up to that point, the Vanquish could not have had a better name. As a pro-tourer, vanquish is exactly what it did to the competition and the styling never failed to turn heads. Unfortunately though, the flagship model was replaced in 2007 and even though the moniker was revived in 2012 and is expected to be revived again in 2023, there’s nothing quite like the original. Those that missed the opportunity to own one of these extraordinary cars brand new will be happy to know that <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2002-aston-martin-vanquish-6/">Bring a Trailer is offering</a> up a second chance.</p>

<p>This black over tan 2002 Aston Martin V12 Vanquish is powered by a 5.9-liter V12 backed by an electro-hydraulically operated six-speed clutchless manual transmission. The interior is way ahead of its time and features luxuries such as power-adjustable heated seats, automatic climate control, and paddle shifters. Not to mention the top-quality tan leather upholstery. Neatly tucked inside the factory 19″ twelve-spoke alloy wheels wearing Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires is a set of four-piston calipers with cross-drilled rotors.</p>

<p>According to the ad, this car has been well maintained and the pictures agree. Recent service records reveal that it has had a new fuel pump, fuel sending unit, and battery installed and  has had the spark plugs, coil packs, and oil changed. Oh and the best thing about this car is that it only has 5,000 miles on it. That’s right, it might as well be new. At the time that this article was published, there were 845 people watching the ad with a high-bid of $34,000. With three days left on the clock a minor scuffle of a bidding war has already broken out. Don’t miss your second chance at owning one of the original examples of the Vanquish, practically, new. </p>
