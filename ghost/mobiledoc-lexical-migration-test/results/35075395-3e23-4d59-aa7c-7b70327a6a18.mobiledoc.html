<p>With the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/162420/1973-chevrolet-blazer">Chevy Blazer</a> and Ford Bronco returning, it’s starting to feel like we rewound to another era - which has us auto enthusiasts talking a lot about the beginning of these vehicles. The smaller scaled SUVs stormed onto the market with tons of versatility and styling with them.</p>
<p>This class of vehicles quickly became the top choice of farmers, off-roaders, and anyone who wanted a little more from their vehicle. But when public interest started to waiver due to the total lack of efficiency that comes with such a vehicle, the class was snuffed, and it’s yet to be known if a comeback of the Chevy Blazer will shake things up, or if it’ll just be a whimper in the market.</p>

<p>What we do know for certain is all of this has led to spiking valuations, and a high-demand, for the class that encapsulates the classic Broncos and Blazers. This example from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Sunnyside+Classics">Sunnyside Classics</a> represents the beginning of the second generation of the Chevy Blazer, that kicked off in 1973. It has only 60K miles on the clock, and plenty more left in it.</p>
<p>The K/5 is a soft-top convertible variant, with a button off roof - making it even more desirable than other examples. It’s powered by a V8 engine that’s backed by a three-speed automatic transmission, and power feeds into a set of custom differentials. It also rides on a completely overhauled suspension, and quite beefy BFG tires.</p>
<p>Both the exterior and interior have been meticulously restored, and feature several elements that might prompt you to consider this to be a resto-mod, of sorts. This 4X4 is a ready to have the top removed and driven into the unbeaten paths, or head to the local car show to wow onlookers. At a listed price of $65K, this Blazer seriously undercuts other examples that have sold recently in similar condition.</p>
