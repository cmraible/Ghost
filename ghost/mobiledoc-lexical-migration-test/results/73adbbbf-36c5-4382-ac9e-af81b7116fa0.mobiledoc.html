<p>Cadillac was once a global standard for luxury and style, and that is evident with this <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/30050/1960-cadillac-series-62?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1960 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible</a>. The seller of this incredible specimen claims the Cadillac has driven only 24,000 over the last 60 years, and it will be up for auction next month through <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a>.</p>

<p>This body style of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1976-cadillac-deville/">Cadillac</a> Series 62 was only around for two years, but it is an icon among classic car designs thanks to its long, low body and the bullet-shaped taillights sculpted into the massive tail fins. The body and undercarriage back up the seller's low-mileage claim, and the single repaint in Olympic White (with a white convertible top) matches the car's original color as shown by the fender trim tag. </p>
<p>Speaking of original, this Cadillac is wearing white wall radial tires with wire wheels, but the car is being sold with its original steel wheels and hubcaps. Likewise, the beautiful blue interior shows little wear, and the only modification is a vintage-style Bluetooth stereo system; the original stereo also comes with the car.</p>
<p>Under the hood, this big Caddy is powered by a 390 cubic-inch V8 and a four-speed Hydra-Matic automatic transmission, and it's sure to be a smooth cruiser thanks to power steering and power brakes. If you want a classic Cadillac that is as fun to drive as it is to show off, then GAA Classic Cars has just what you're looking.</p>
