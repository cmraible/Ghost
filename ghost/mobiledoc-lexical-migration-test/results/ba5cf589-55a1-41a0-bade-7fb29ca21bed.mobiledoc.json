That was enough time for someone, if not multiple people, to contact the US Air Force and ask to speak to their manager. Those people on the swanky island saw some of the crew pushing a 1970 BMW R75/5 up the aircraft's ramp and were incensed “the help” would do such a thing."

I’m betting they just made a guess, because they assume everyone is always acting in bad faith. These are the same people who yell at grocery store clerks, servers at restaurants, and the workers at a quick lube place. To always be asking to speak to the manager because you want someone to be fired for some benign “offense” must be absolutely exhausting. It also demonstrates how little self-awareness they’ve developed."

Sure, they could’ve paid to have it shipped, but they were in the neighborhood and probably didn’t want to pay the shipping fees. Have you ever seen how little service members get paid? To the people of Martha’s Vineyard it would be their monthly wine budget – sorry, whine budget. "

On March 27 their deed was revealed and the crew was grounded. As for the motorcycle, it’s still in California, even though the crew was transported to Keesler Airforce Base in Mississippi."
