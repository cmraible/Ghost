<p>Earlier this year, <em>The New York Times</em> declared it “does not allow oil and gas companies to sponsor its climate newsletter, its climate summit, or its podcast <em>The Daily</em>.” It’s why one of the articles we highlight in this edition of Weekend Reader puts forward a very pressing question: Why did <em>The Daily</em> run ads from Exxon during the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, especially since the ads were filled with climate misinformation?</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://heated.world/p/how-exxon-duped-the-daily"><strong>How Exxon Duped “The Daily”</strong></a> (Heated) <em>— “The </em>New York Times<em>’s podcast </em>The Daily<em> is one of the most popular podcasts in the world. Each day, millions of people tune in for a deep-dive news story — plus three uninterrupted messages from a trusted advertising partner. Early last week, that partner was ExxonMobil, the world’s fourth most-polluting fossil fuel company. In paid audio messages that aired amid high-stakes climate negotiations in Scotland, the oil giant sought to convince The Daily’s audience it was moving toward a safe climate future. The ad appeared to violate The Daily’s policy against fossil fuel sponsorships, which the Times itself revealed earlier this year.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/build-back-better-civil-war-reconstruction-capital-austerity"><strong>The American Ruling Class Has Never Let Us Build Back Better</strong></a> (Jacobin) — <em>“The defeat of Reconstruction was the nation’s first failure to build back better, and it set the stage for the failures that followed. American austerity politics found their first full expression during this period, pivoting on an ideological turn to classical liberalism within the Republican Party. The events of the 1870s created a pattern of missed opportunities and reactionary blowback that has since been repeated time and again.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-hamptons-real-estate-beach-climate-proofing/"><strong>Unlimited Sand and Money Still Won’t Save the Hamptons</strong></a><strong></strong>(Bloomberg)<strong></strong>—<strong></strong><em>“What’s happening on beaches in the Hamptons and nearby is no last-minute maneuver. The spending is merely the latest turn in an eight-decade drama between humans and nature — storm destruction and restoration, lobbying and lawsuits — that’s creating one of the most ambitious running battles against climate change in U.S. history. Of all places, it’s the Hamptons and nearby beaches that will be the biggest test bed for the elaborate policies and defensive measures needed in vulnerable beach communities around the world, even those that aren’t home to millionaires and billionaires. That makes the Hamptons both a climate laboratory and the face of an existential question: How long can, and should, governments deploy a mountain of cash against the implacable rise of warming seas?”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/31/atlanta-mental-health-police-courts/?src=longreads"><strong>“Judge, Lawyer, Help, Case Dismissed”</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>“Harmony isn’t exactly unique; thousands of people in Georgia have mental illnesses and developmental disabilities and addictions, flitting into and out of the state’s care in between long bouts of homelessness. But Harmony is at the center of the Familiar Faces project, an official list of people with severe and persistent illnesses whom Fulton County, where Atlanta is located, and the state desperately want to get off the street and out of the county jail. I would argue that no one currently experiencing homelessness in Fulton County, if not the state, requires more help than Harmony.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/happy-elephant-bronx-zoo-nhrp-lawsuit/620672/"><strong>The Elephant Who Could Be A Person</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“A ‘person’ is something of a legal fiction. Under U.S. law, a corporation can be a person. So can a ship… Some forms of artificial intelligence might one day become persons. But can an </em>elephant <em>be a person? No case like this has ever reached so high a court, anywhere in the English-speaking world. The elephant suit might be an edge case, but it is by no means a frivolous case. In an age of mass extinction and climate catastrophe, the questions it raises, about the relationship between humans, animals, and the natural world, concern the future of life on Earth, questions that much existing law is catastrophically ill-equipped to address.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/02/jimmy-savile-bbc-journalists-risked-jobs-reveal-truth?src=longreads"><strong>How Two BBC Journalists Risked Their Jobs To Reveal The Truth About Jimmy Savile</strong></a> (The Guardian) — “<em>Within a few weeks of Savile’s death, MacKean had collected on-the-record testimony from 10 women who had been at Duncroft. Seven had been abused and three had witnessed abuse by Savile. It had been difficult to convince them to go public. Some told her they worried they would be seen as complicit; they were sure they wouldn’t be believed. Some feared a backlash, that people would claim they were out for something: compensation, notoriety. MacKean, a BBC journalist of 20 years’ standing, assured the women that they’d have the weight of Newsnight behind them, and the support of the BBC. But a few days before the transmission date, the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, told MacKean and Jones that the piece couldn’t be broadcast.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/to-catch-a-turtle-thief/"><strong>To Catch A Turtle Thief: Blowing The Lid Off An International Smuggling Operation</strong></a> (The Walrus) — <em>“The parcel of turtle hatchlings would come to reveal much more than just who had sent them: it would act as the first bread crumb in a trail from the Calgary airport to a New Jersey swamp to exotic pet collections in China, exposing a network far larger than one person and one padded envelope.”</em></li>
