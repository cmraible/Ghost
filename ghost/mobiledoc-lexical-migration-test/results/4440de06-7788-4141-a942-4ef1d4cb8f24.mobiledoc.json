The stock 327 V8 has been fitted with an electronically controlled fuel injection system making this the perfect car to tear up the track. It's been fitted with an automatic 4-speed transmission so you can just focus on you and the open road, and with 4-wheel disc brakes along with power steering, it's got the handling to compete as well."

Anyone lucky enough to get their hands on this car and patient enough to learn this exquisite automobile will certainly be the talk of the town. That talk will be well earned because it's not every day that you see such a clean classic Camaro. "
