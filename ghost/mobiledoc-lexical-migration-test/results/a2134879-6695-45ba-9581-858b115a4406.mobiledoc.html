<p><a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1931-chevrolet-independence-2-door-sedan/?mc_cid=824addebb2&mc_eid=0bc35d4898">In the early 1900s</a>, the automobile manufacturing industry was booming due to significant technological advancements. It takes little more than a simple google search to see the link between the fantastic pieces of automotive innovation we see today and the cars that came before them. The vehicles from the 1930s were prevalent for their ability to show off the driver's personality with wide fender flares and big V8 engines under the hood. That's precisely why these cars have amassed such a large following within the show car, racing, and daily driving community. Here's your chance to get a vintage automotive legend with an even bigger surprise under the hood than you might think.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1931-chevrolet-independence-2-door-sedan/?mc_cid=824addebb2&mc_eid=0bc35d4898">1931 Chevrolet road car</a> that was named after what is probably the most quintessential American idea ever created, Independence. It's easy to see why cars like this were so top-rated in their day, as the entire vehicle screams style and performance. Everything from the swooping fender flares to the exposed engine bay gives the car an aerodynamic feel despite being possibly the furthest thing from sleek one could imagine. This was added to provide the driver with a sense of performance. So how does this Chevrolet compare to others like it on the drag strip?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clasiq.com/auction/1931-chevrolet-independence-2-door-sedan/?mc_cid=824addebb2&mc_eid=0bc35d4898">The answer</a> to that question is extremely well as it was obviously made into a hotrod during its prime days of driving around. Under the hood is a massive 350 ci V8 engine that utilizes a dual four-barrel carburetor set up to put out more power than virtually any other car like it you can find at your local dragstrip. On top of all that, you also get a reliable TH350 three-speed automatic transmission, which should make everything from cruising to racing a lot more fun. Overall this is the perfect car for any enthusiast with love for classic hot rods looking for a dependable beast they could have some fun with.</p>
