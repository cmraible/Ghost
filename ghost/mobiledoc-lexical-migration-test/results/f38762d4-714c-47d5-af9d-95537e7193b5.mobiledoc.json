This led organizers to rethink their original plans to keep everyone safe â€“ team members, track officials and spectators. Originally scheduled for May 24th, organizers initially postponed the race to the current August 23rd race date with 50 percent spectator capacity, but in June, that number dropped to 25 percent as the virus continued to spread."
