This engine sounds cool under the hood of this Defender, but that isn't the only reason to love this rig. The exterior is finished in Aston Martin's version of British Racing Green, and the look also includes beautiful 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped in BFGoodrich All Terrain T/A KO2 tires."

The front seats are racing bucket seats, while the rear passengers get side-facing buckets as well. This looks like a high-quality interior worthy of the Defender's price tag right down to the details such as the black suede headliner and upgraded digital gauge cluster display."
