<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/murder-suspect-stolen-bmw/">BMW</a> recently took the wraps off the 8 Series Collector’s Edition, which comes with an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alpina-z8-crashed/">extremely unique spec</a>. These cars will likely become instantly collectibles to be cherished by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bmw-group-launches/">BMW fans</a>. Of course, production will be limited, plus there’s one other factor leading to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/your-car-might-be-worth-more/">scarcity</a> of these cars: they will only be available to purchase in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">Japan</a>.</p>

<p>That’s right, if you’re living in the United States and want to get your hands on a BMW 8 Series Collector’s Edition, it’s going to be a little bit tricky. If you do work out a way to snag one, be prepared to pony up big. Each one is selling for about 15 million yen, which is approximately $145,000 USD. That price point makes it even more exclusive and will only add fuel to the fire when it comes to collectibility.</p>

<p>For that kind of cash you’d expect something pretty phenomenal. Some people seem disappointed the Collector’s Edition is only being offered as a BMW 840i Gran Coupe and not one of the top-tier models. Considering the lofty price, if that were the case customers would be shelling out even more cash.</p>

<p>Since the Collector’s Edition is an 840i, it comes with the silky-smooth turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6. Even though it’s not the most powerful option for the 8 Series it’s still a wonderful engine. You also get to choose four different paint options to dress up the car: Aventurine Red, Azurite Black, Davit Grey, and Tanzinite Blue. All are BMW Individual colors with a richness and depth which will dazzle the eye.</p>

<p>Thrown in the mix as well is the M Sport package, plus 20-inch 729 M bi-color wheels, and Merino Ivory White leather upholstery. All that definitely dresses the car up and makes it a standout compared to other BMW 8 Series. We believe this special edition will age quite well, becoming an increasingly sought-after car as time marches forward.</p>
