Apparently, it was a California car, so this ride wasn’t exposed to the harsh elements and rust-inducing road salt you get in other parts of the country. Thanks to a single repaint in the original Sunset Mist, it is definitely in the kind of condition you want to make a great impression."

A light cosmetic restoration returned the different elements to their original glory, so everything shines and works properly. Straight out of the factory, this Olds came with all kinds of luxuries for its time. There’s air conditioning, power locks, power seats, power steering, power brakes, and power windows. The Autronic Eye sits atop the dash, a precursor to modern automatic high beams. All the lights work properly, including the courtesy lights."
