While trying to hit 192 mph on a public highway is pure stupidity, we wonder if it would even be possible since conditions wouldn’t be quite as ideal as on this runway. Don’t try to prove us wrong on that, please."

Add to that the fact fans of European supercars also like to dump on the C8 because after all it’s American and “only a Corvette” and you can easily see why C8 fans might have a bit of a chip on their shoulder."

Sure, it’s not the best at everything, but what vehicle is? And for the price, it’s hard to get such a performance bargain. And perhaps that’s why some enthusiasts in Europe don’t like it since they seem to have a thing for unobtainable cars."
