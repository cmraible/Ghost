Selby sourced a Falcon nose and the vents which sit behind the doors. For the roof-mounted wing, he turned to a 1980 Chevy Camaro. For the fastback portion, he cut up a shell donated by a 1970 Ford Torino. Of course, there’s custom fabrication on top of these pieces, but to source parts from all these different vehicles took some serious creativity."
