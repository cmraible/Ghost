<p>As a world-leading authority on 1960s-era Shelby American automobiles, Stephan Becker Automotive Group has offered some of the most collectible Shelby cars over the years but <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/1968-shelby-gt500-convertible?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=3">this 1968 Shelby GT500 convertible</a> might be close to topping the list. Only 402 convertibles were made in 1968 and this car sits exactly how it did when it rolled off the lot. Thanks to spending most of its life in Arizona, It has never been restored. It is believed to have only 86,000 actual miles put there by its 3 known owners. Most of the mileage was more than likely racked up by the second owner <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/1968-shelby-gt500-convertible?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=3">who owned the car</a> for 34 years.</p>

<p>Under the hood of this Highland Green <a href="https://www.beckerautogroup.com/inventory-vehicles/1968-shelby-gt500-convertible?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=3">1968 Shelby GT500 convertible</a> is the original 428-cid Police Interceptor engine mated to a C6 automatic transmission that leads into a 9-inch rear end with a 3.50:1 axle ratio and limited slip differential. Ensuring timeless good looks and adequate grip are a set of Goodyear Speedway raised white letter tires wrapped around a set of Shelby 10-spoke wheels. All of the Shelby installed trim and pieces are in place and remain in good shape and the black decor and woodgrain interior is about as perfect as it gets.</p>
