Thanks to the bright hue, it makes the classic elements like its full-length trim and brightwork, like form-fitting chrome bumpers, seriously stand out. More upgrades on the body include a rear spoiler, wide exhaust tips, and American Racing competition-style Torque Thrust wheels on each corner. Equipped with a functional hood scoop that feeds fresh air into the engine adds to its aggressive aesthetic while helping with performance. In fantastic condition through and through, the description states that the car only has a hair over 3,000 miles on the clock."

The car features muscle car-like black vinyl bucket seats, and they are clean and complete down to the insignia trim. The inside also features an upgraded AM/FM digital tuner complete with cassette player to keep the tunes playing. On the dash are round gauge pods that almost look as if they were taken from an Italian sports car. Other interior goodies include the upgraded wood-trim steering wheel, a Hurst reverse lockout shifter, and floor mats with red Fairlane stitching."
