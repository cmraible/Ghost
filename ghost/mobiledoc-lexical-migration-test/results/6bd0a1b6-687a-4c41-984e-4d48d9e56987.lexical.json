Tweetdeck – use two columns for the same search term, one for the term, and one for the term, but filtered by retweet.\n2. Twitter Collections (was custom timelines) – drag tweets into a custom timeline, to gather them all in one place for later use.\n3. Twitter Lists: on Twitter, select Timelines on the left, and then select lists – to find experts in a field\n4. Facebook Geolocation (selecting where posts are targeted): works really well if you have a large following in that region already. Posst without images or links do well at the moment – they got 10,000 comments in a day for an Egypt-targetted post.\n5. Facebook Follow: use your settings to limit it to Friends of Friends, pushing very one else to Follow. Set posts you’re tagged in to “Friends only”.\n6. Storyful Multisearch is great. Search a whole range of social media sites from one search box.\n7. Instagram – many of us use it to source stories. But it can also be used for moments of reporting to the community. Gramfeed is a great way of searching for a location.\n8. Tagg.ly – Allows you to watermark images on social.\n9. Watermark.ws – Another handy watermarking tool\n\n\n## Richard Moynihan, social media editor, The Telegraph\n\n![Rich moynihan](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2014/07/rich-moynihan.jpg?resize=960%2C614 \"rich-moynihan.jpg\")\n\n**Analytics and metrics**\n\n**[Buzzsumo](http://buzzsumo.com)** – measures your shares and competitor stories (LinkTally.com is an alternative), across a range of core social media sites. You can drill down into the sharers, and who were the most influential.\n\nIt also allows you to find people influential on topics, and target them to work with, of for retweets.\n\nIt was heavily used by them for [Project Babb](http://babb.telegraph.co.uk), their sports-centric site. They used it to target people whose audiences they wanted to get access to. They also didn’t include comments on the site, because they wanted people discussing it on social media. It was a big success, and has some of the Telegraph’s most shared stories…\n\n**Pivot Tables** – *incredibly useful* for tidying up data. He uses it, for example, for identifying total number of shares per author.\n\n\n"
