Some other cars are in the structure, and one makes an appearance in the next video. Making matters a little worse is the fact the barn is open to the elements, so the cars have plenty of that valuable barn find dust on them."

That white one which cleaned up nicely at the car wash sold quickly, so it’s not in the second video. Both of the remaining cars have what you might call a “healthy patina” so they’re not nearly as pretty. If you’re interested in these cars, they were still for sale when the video dropped, although you never know at this point. Neither car is a numbers-matching, so that means they’re relatively affordable but you won’t win any awards for correctness."
