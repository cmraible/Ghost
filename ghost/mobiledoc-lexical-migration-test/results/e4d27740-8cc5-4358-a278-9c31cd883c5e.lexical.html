<p>Starting life as a <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11074107&avId=910074&pageID=6&utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=May1">Defender 90 Testarossa</a> from Genoa, Italy, this solid bodied survivor would have made an excellent addition to most any collection. However, the potential for so much more was there, a potential that was quickly spotted by its importer. Once touching ground in the U.S., <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11074107&avId=910074&pageID=6&utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=May1">the Defender</a> then underwent an incredible transformation into what it is today - and incredible go anywhere, do anything utility vehicle. Not too far off from Land Rover’s intentions but miles ahead of actuality. </p>

<p>Starting from the ground up, this <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11074107&avId=910074&pageID=6&utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=May1">Defender 90</a> sit tall on 37-inch BFGoodrich KM3 tires wrapped around Black Rhino beadlock wheels, perfectly hiding TeraFlex big disc brakes. A custom long-arm suspension with TeraFlex suspension components and Fox shocks control track and movement of the front and rear Dana 44 axles fitted with 4.10:1 gears and selectable lockers. At the heart of the build is a GM LS1 5.3-liter V8 that feeds 355-horsepower through a 6-speed automatic transmission. However, the improvements did not stop there. </p>

<p>Appropriately covered in Rhino-Lining and a stunning shade of Masai Red paint, it would be hard to imagine a better looking <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11074107&avId=910074&pageID=6&utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=Article&utm_campaign=May1">Land Rover</a>. Custom Salt Coast rear and front bumpers sit at either end with a Warn winch with synthetic winch line installed on the latter. Protecting the sides are a custom set of “boat side” rock sliders with integrated steps that deploy for ease of entering and exiting the vehicle. An original-style tan soft top matches a tan and black two-tone interior. </p>

<p>With over $100K invested in this build, it would be hard to find a better riding, better looking, and more capable Defender with the classic style of the 1980s.
