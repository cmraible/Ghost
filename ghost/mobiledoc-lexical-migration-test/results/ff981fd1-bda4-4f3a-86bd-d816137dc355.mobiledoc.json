Not only that, the fenders on the Challenger's body were widened 1.5 inches all around. Since the heart of the car is a massive supercharged 6.2-liter V8, a Challenger R/T hood was modified to accommodate the monster mill. Shifting power comes from a Tranzilla-built Viper T-56 six-speed manual transmission which twists a modified Viper differential housing 3.73 gears. Still waiting on the set of Viper-spec wheels to add to the car, and those will come wrapped with R18 rubber (295/30 front, 335/30 rear). "
