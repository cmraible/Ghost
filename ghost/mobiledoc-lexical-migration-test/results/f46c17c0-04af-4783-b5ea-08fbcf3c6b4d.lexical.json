We’ve seen it with cars like the Shelby GT500, Dodge Hellcat, and even the new C8 Corvette. You might think these kinds of incidents are painful for the new car’s owner but you can profit off that by snatching the wrecked heap for peanuts, but you’re wrong. As we’ve seen, wrecked C8 Corvettes fetch top dollar and aren’t the screaming deal you’d expect. In fact, insurance auction expert and YouTuber Samcrac says you should just avoid them altogether.",

He also comes across a C7 that’s missing the roof and front end, but the drivetrain looks fine. There’s a custom C5 with front-end damage, which he thinks would be good to strip for parts. It also has a super sweet Z06 badge that would fool a lot of people. Anyway, check out the video for yourself. ",
