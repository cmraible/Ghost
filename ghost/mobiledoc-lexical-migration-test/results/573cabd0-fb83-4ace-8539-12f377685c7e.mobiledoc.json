The highest bid recorded was a lofty $7.5 million, which was exactly at the low end of what Mecum estimated it would sell for, so many were surprised when a deal was not reached. "

Having something which is exceptionally rare, highly desirable, and in the right condition are always pluses. All those stars align with this 1965 Ford GT Competition Prototype Roadster, which is part of the Mecum Indy 2020 auction."

This is one of only five produced, but only one other survives today. That definitely qualifies as rare, but this is the only Ford GT Competition Prototype Roadster to have been raced at Le Mans, so it has quite the history."

Before then, Shelby gave Jeffries a HiPo 289 V8, which has been installed. A professional restoration has returned it to its Le Mans condition, livery and all."

This is the kind of vehicle you use to impress even the most fabulously wealthy car collectors. Plus, you can almost guarantee people like Jay Leno will become your best buddy so they can ogle it and beg to take it for a spin."
