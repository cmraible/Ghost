Aside from being a genuine barn find, the real attraction to this Corvette is that it has less than 58,000 original miles. Speaking of original, the picture of the engine compartment reveals that the car's original color could be War Bonnet Yellow judging by the exposed gold paint. The interior is actually in a bit rougher shape than the outside of the Corvette, but it would appear that most of the missing parts are piled up the cargo area."
