          ". My chief complaint is the sound design. The mixing is done poorly, some sounds are way too loud in comparison to the rest of the game. The main menu changes throughout the game but the first one that the game shows is one that has several fires burning in a scorched battlefield, and the sound of the fires is deafening. The aliens all sound the same, leading to a horde of different enemies all making the same growling sound over and over again. The music sounds like something off of a royalty-free website and there is this disgusting sound that plays throughout the game that seems attached to absolutely nothing. It plays consistently throughout every area I’ve been through, regardless of enemy presence, and it sounds like someone playing with raw chicken over a loudspeaker. Given how often I’ve heard it, I can only assume it’s part of the game's soundtrack. "

A good voice actor can elevate a script and a good script can have the audience overlook a lacking actor. However when both are bad, the experience is painful. Character’s talk way too much, saying redundant sentences like “Enemies nearby detected.” Enemies nearby and Enemies detected are essentially the same statement, and I know this is nitpicky, but I wouldn’t be mentioning this if I didn’t hear it with literally every group of enemies I encountered, even if it was two groups on opposite sides of the same room. You will also be reminded if a door is locked every single time you approach it, regardless of if you’re even facing it. "

However, that alone did not make the game good. Enemy design and environments are very samey, the map is barebones and does not hint at all about how to progress, wall buttons that unlock doors are often easy to miss and the camera angles can often hide them from you. This is just a small selection of game design missteps that I would easily overlook if the game had more going for it."
