<p>When the S197 Mustang galloped onto centre stage in 2005, the public was genuinely wowed. The design harked back to the original Pony car from the swinging sixties; flared arches, extended overhanging bonnet and retro-styled head and tail lights crafted a striking resemblance to the iconic fastbacks of yesteryear.</p>
<p>The S197 initially came with two engine layouts. The base model was the 4.0-liter V6, and the all-out 4.6-liter V8. The V6 produced a rather tragic 210 horsepower, but the V8 fared better with a slightly more ferocious 300 horsepower, also allowing a clean 0-60 mph of 5.0 seconds flat.</p>

<p>The S197 took the country by storm, and in contrast to the outgoing SN95 model, Ford managed to shift a whole 24% more when compared to sales of the previous model. This was when Steve Saleen decided to give Ford a call. You know, the man responsible for some heavily modified Mustangs and the two starring cars from <em>Transformers</em>. Yeah, that guy.</p>
<p>Steve Saleen had been in the performance upgrade business since 1983, having gained valuable experience as a Formula Atlantic race car driver. In addition to creating the jaw-dropping GTR-One concept car that was also based on the new platform, the S281 marque was re-introduced to the model line-up – '281' representing the cubic capacity of the engine, which outlines the 4.6-liter V8 lump as a foundation for the all-new model.</p>

<p>The get-up assists in spraying some 435-horsepower across the tarmac. Throw in the hair-raising whine of that twin-screw blower, and you have a practically unbeatable recipe. The 60mph barrier is breached in only 4.6 seconds, with a reported top speed of 180mph, helping to justify the excellent ‘bar topic’ 200 mph readout on the speedometer.</p>
<p>The supercharger assembly used in the S281SC is a patented design by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ftx=Saleen">Saleen</a> themselves. The compact design allowed Saleen to incorporate the supercharger housing, intercooler and intake manifold into one unit that nestled between the valley of the engines 'vee' section.</p>

<p>They even gave this burst of genius a name; the Saleen Series VI Integrated Twin Screw Supercharger. Air-per-rotation was pushed to dazzling levels, with an increase of a whopping 900cc over the previous generations abilities, pushing input to 2300cc.</p>
<p>If you fancied a new S197 Saleen then you don’t need to worry, this is as new as they get, and a bit of a bargain too.</p>
