<p>Welcome to TechieBytes episode 79 <em>Why Clubhouse isn't the next big thing (feat. Nate Elliott) </em></p>
<p>Today I'm speaking with <a href="https://nateelliott.com">Nate Elliott</a>, he's a law student at Gonzaga University, runs content for BillBox, and writes a newsletter at <a href="https://startupsalad.substack.com">Startup Salad</a>. We discuss the up hill struggle that is awaiting Clubhouse as more competitors emerge, including by social incumbents such as Twitter and Facebook as well as what the app looks like after the pandemic. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Be sure to read Nate's <a href="https://twitter.com/nateelliott/status/1355203373671141379?s=21">Twitter thread</a> on the bear case for Clubhouse too.</p>
<p>I've also started a <a href="https://sfle.club">South Florida Entrepreneur Club</a> along with my new friend (whom I met on CH), Nicholas Mohnacky (@mohnacky on CH)! If you're an entrepreneur in Florida (or anywhere around the world) be sure to follow me on Clubhouse (@jeffweisbein) and join us every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3PM ET! Sign up <a href="https://sfle.club">on the site</a> for the mailing list and follow our <a href="https://twitter.com/sfleclub">Twitter</a> for updates.</p>
