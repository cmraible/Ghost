Perhaps the argument can finally be settled once the race has run between this astonishing Ford mustang and it’s Acura Integra competitor.",

Essentially, the Mustang took off with is nearly popping a wheelie and gapping the Integra by several car lengths. It’s quite funny how this video was supposed to prove the haters of Honda wrong and show the world that the Japanese could really make a good drag racing car. However the second round turned out pretty much the same with the heavier and less powerful mustang beating the Integra down the strip. So, in conclusion, because the team framed this video as a Honda versus haters moment, it is officially OK to make fun of Integras. All jokes aside, both of these cars are pretty wicked and everybody involved, including the drivers, had a lot of fun which is what really matters.",
