<p>We just received a tip from someone that <a title="Google Indexes over 86,000 print servers" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:hp/device/this.LCDispatcher&oq=inurl:hp/device/this.LCDispatcher&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&tbo=d&sclient=psy-ab&q=inurl:hp/device/this.LCDispatcher?nav=hp.Print&oq=inurl:hp/device/this.LCDispatcher?nav=hp.Print&gs_l=serp.12...247171.254344.0.255548.13.13.0.0.0.0.171.1905.0j13.13.0.les;..0.0...1c.1.bdSSZ-ZdqvM&pbx=1&fp=1&biw=1366&bih=603&cad=b&sei=77QCUe3UBcbvsgaxyICwDA&sei=ubgCUbn8Oa-x0AHHzoHIAw&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&sei=NrkCUZuPGuHs0QGBrYCoBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google is indexing 80,000 printers</a> that are connected to the Internet.  Using a little Google search magic, it becomes apparent that you can really find anything using Google.  To top it off, aside from just being indexed by Google, you can easily print something to any one of these 80,000 printers surely giving the owner of the printer quite a scare.  Obviously the people who configured these print servers skipped firewall 101 class.</p>
<p>Several of the print servers appear to be hosted at universities around the world, including RIT and the University of Washington.  Of course, this query looks specifically for HP printers (probably the most common type), but I’m sure it could be modified to find others as well.</p>
<p>Happy printing? Just kidding.</p>
