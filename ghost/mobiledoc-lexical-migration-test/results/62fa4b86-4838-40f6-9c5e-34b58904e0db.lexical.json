Randall \"Memphis\" Raines (Cage) had a tumultuous relationship with Eleanor, and he was taken on an insane ride when trying to reign it in as the last car on the heist to save his brother Kip from the grips of an evil drug dealer. Designed by Steve Sanford, the pro-touring Eleanor became a household name after it stole the hearts of everyone who watched the movie. Even though the movie came out in 2000, the '67 Eleanor is still idealized and recreated today for many personal builds. Hugely popular, one of the three movie cars sold at Mecum's Indianapolis auction in 2013 for a staggering $1 million. ",
