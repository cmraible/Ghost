Before he was a politician, he was an actor, and then Governor of California, where he famously signed the legislation that created the California Air Resources Board, or CARB for short. Interestingly enough, the late President of the United States didn't have a sprawling car collection, like many people of considerable means do, but he did have some interesting vehicles."

This Jeep is still around at the California ranch once owned by Reagan. It's said that Mrs. Reagan also surprised him in 1983 with a CJ-8 Scrambler."
