So let’s take a look…</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardware and Software Sales</span></h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1714\" style=\"width: 604px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1714\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1714\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-Switch-Sales-March-2018.png?resize=594%2C691\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch Sales March 2018\" width=\"594\" height=\"691\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-Switch-Sales-March-2018.png?w=594&amp;ssl=1 594w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-Switch-Sales-March-2018.png?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Nintendo-Switch-Sales-March-2018.png?resize=300%2C349&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit Nintendo Japan</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nintendo Switch is selling quite well sitting at 17.79 million units units. When you put this into perspective, the Switch has nearly reached the GameCube in total units sold as the purple cube sold just over 21 million units.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Switch has also sold 68.97 software units. When putting this into perspective, that averages out to just under four games per Nintendo Switch.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top 8 Selling Switch Games</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo also provided us with the sales numbers their games, so let&#8217;s go through them and we&#8217;ll talk about them after:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kirby Star Allies (1.26 million units)</span></p>\n<p>7. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (1.31 million units)</p>\n<p>6. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arms (1.85 million units)</span></p>\n<p>5. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1-2-Switch (2.29 million units)</span></p>\n<p>4. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Splatoon 2 (6.02 million units)</span></p>\n<p>3. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (8.48 million units)</span></p>\n<p>2. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (9.22 million units)</span></p>\n<p>1. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Mario Odyssey (10.41 million units)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alright first off, those are some INSANE numbers! So let’s go through the list.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1715\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wow-Nintendo-Switch.png?resize=900%2C450\" alt=\"Wow Nintendo Switch\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kirby Star Allies at 1.26 million units is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impressive considering that it only released last month in March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xenoblade Chronicles 2’s sales cements it as the fastest selling Xeno game in its series’ history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arms at 1.85 million units is impressive for a new IP, however it doesn&#8217;t seem to have had the level of success that Nintendo were hoping for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1-2-Switch at 2.29 million units isn&#8217;t surprising as it was a launch title, but it clearly wasn&#8217;t as successful as the other launch title on this list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we have a huge leap with Splatoon 2! What a massive achievement a series that still feels quite new and fresh. Sales numbers for the game in Japan alone is very impressive!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breath of the Wild at 8.48 million units (not including Wii U numbers) cements the game as the best selling Legend of Zelda game ever.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has officially outsold the original Wii U version and it doesn&#8217;t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, Super Mario Odyssey is the first game to crack 10 million units sold and cements it as the best selling 3D Mario game of all time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like we said, some crazy numbers right there.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So all in all, some fantastic signs for Nintendo so far and they don&#8217;t plan on slowing down anytime soon.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on the Nintendo Switch, make sure to </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/switchaboo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like us on Facebook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and follow us on Twitter @switchaboonews.
