          " been a symbol in America for high class, wealth, and status for decades because  of their brand image. Essentially, while other brands simply say they are all about style, the Buick manufacturing company backs up their claims. This is most prevalent with their classic models such as the Regal and even some older vehicles made in  the 1950s. One  particularly good example  of that  latter distinction comes in the form of a 1951  Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon, which uses its good looks and high performance to be one of the most striking  automobiles of the 1950s."

          ", this top-of-the-line Estate Wagon was originally delivered to France, and later moved to London with a different owner. It remains in remarkable unrestored and original condition. The Buick shows 42,921 miles, and it remains to be a very solid car. Its interior is retains all of the original upholstery, and the charm of the whole car is undeniable."
