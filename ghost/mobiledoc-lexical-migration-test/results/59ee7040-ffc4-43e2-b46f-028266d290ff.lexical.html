<p>While the F-Type certainly is its own model that features smoother body lines, a more powerful V8 engine, and, obviously, a more modern design, we couldnâ€™t help but see the connection to the <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26617/lot/123/?category=list&length=12&page=2">original E-Type</a>. For example, this 1966 Jaguar E-type Series I 4.2 Roadster being offered by Bonhams.</p>

<p>It featured all of the options that made the model so legendary, including a matching black canvas top and leather interior, classic chrome wire-wheels, and a powerful 4.2-Liter engine capable of pushing the roadster to its 150-mph top speed. It also features a 4-speed manual transmission, a 4-wheel independent suspension, and 4-wheel disc brakes. All options that lead many enthusiasts to credit the car for industry wide inspiration.</p>

<p>55 years later, <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26617/lot/123/?category=list&length=12&page=2">this highly collectable E-Type</a> presents well with its shiny metallic finish and chrome, and its lightly patented interior. A wood-rimmed steering wheel perfectly complements the classy interior. The original engine has been replaced with a comparable 4.2-liter with the stock specifications and the Jaguar is said to have been well maintained and garage kept. With a starting price of $130,000, this seems like a good opportunity for a Jaguar enthusiast to get their hands on one of the most celebrated cars of all time.</p>
