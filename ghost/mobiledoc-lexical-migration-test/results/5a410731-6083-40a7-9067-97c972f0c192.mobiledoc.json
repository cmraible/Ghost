Recently, the man found himself a GT500KR Mustang which features more than enough performance from the Shelby factory. That distinction makes the Mustang one of the coolest classic collector cars with a fastback style and big V8 engine under the hood."

Well, actually there wasn't really anything under the hood when Dennis got there but originally it had a true Shelby racing engine. That motor’s name was the 428 Cobra-Jet which made more power than almost anything on the market in its day. Incredibly, the engine is still available so Dennis went ahead and scooped that up too in hopes of restoring it for future use."

However, it's not exactly like bringing the old ‘Stang back to life will be easy despite its pretty good looking Red paint job. Over the years, Dennis Collins has been known to regularly find himself in possession of a GT500 with that very same platform backing up its performance. Perhaps this will transfer to the new build with an exceptional range of knowledge, experience, and extra parts, so that we may see the car back on the road once again."
