A recent earnings call for America’s CAR-MART details out the growing rate vehicle repossessions in this country. Per CFO Vickie D. Judy, the company, government stimulus money has helped shrink car loan charge-offs, even when consumers are financing greater amounts thanks to increased used vehicle prices. Higher car repossession rates also kept charge-offs lower, with the company achieving 28.5% for the past quarter versus 27.1% a year ago and 26.6% two years ago.",
