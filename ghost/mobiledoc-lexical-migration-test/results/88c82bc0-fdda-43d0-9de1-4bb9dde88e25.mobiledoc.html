<p>This week, we start with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/">latest report</a> on the climate crisis – this time focused on solutions. The report warns that the world is on track to overshoot the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warning to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the decade, paving the way for more frequent extreme weather events, food scarcity, and political unrest. But the report also points out that the groundwork has been laid for a rapid energy transition — if only the fossil fuel industry and petrostates would step out of the way, and capital could be redirected towards renewable energy.</p>

<p><strong>NUTS AND BOLTS: </strong>The latest IPCC document is part of the panel’s sixth such climate assessment, compiled by more than 700 voluntary authors who are mostly scientists and researchers. An additional summary for policymakers is reviewed (and edited) by government delegations; this year’s review process was the <a href="https://twitter.com/JPvanYpersele/status/1510709441259319302">longest in IPCC history.</a><em>Carbon Brief</em> published an <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-on-how-to-tackle-climate-change">in-depth Q&A</a> on the key findings of the report. Some takeaways that stuck out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Carbon emissions have continued to increase over the past decade, but increased more slowly than in the preceding decade.</li>
    <li>If countries follow their existing climate pledges, the world is still on track to overshoot the Paris Agreement goal limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the decade.</li>
    <li>Carbon emissions must peak by 2025 and be roughly halved by 2030 to set the world on track for a world that is 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Washington Post </em>also has this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/04/04/climate-change-report-united-nations-ipcc/">excellent breakdown</a> of the content of the report and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/04/04/ipcc-climate-change-solutions/">the solutions</a> it proposed.</p>
<p><strong>HEAVY-HANDED EDITING: </strong>The report makes very clear — like every report before it — what must happen to limit global warming to an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius, after which point the earth’s systems may cross irreversible <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">tipping points</a>. Trillions of dollars worth of fossil fuel assets must be left in the ground and fossil-fueled power plants need to be closed decades ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>But, as <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/166011/ipcc-climate-fossil-fuels">Kate Aronoff writes in <em>The New Republic</em></a><em>, </em>despite these clear warnings from scientists, the report was edited by government delegations and lobbyists who watered down the conclusions about what must happen to fossil fuels. That included adding a key word, “unabated,” to references to “fossil fuels,” which implies that fossil fuel use could continue if “abated” by carbon capture and storage technology. “That word [“unabated”] is inserted precisely to perpetuate the myth that the world still can keep using fossil fuels without harming people and the planet, which doesn’t square with the science,” Nikki Reisch, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Center for International Environmental Law, told Aronoff.</p>
<p><strong>FOSSIL FREE PROSPERITY: </strong>For the first time in IPCC history, the panel asked a question which challenges a key narrative underpinning the fossil fuel industry: Do fossil fuels actually increase our standard of living? As <a href="https://www.drilledpodcast.com/debunking-demand-ipcc-mitigation-report-part-1/">Amy Westervelt writes in <em>Drilled News</em></a>, the newest report answered that question with a resounding “no.” She cites the report: “People demand services and not primary energy and physical resources per se. Focusing on demand for services and the different social and political roles people play broadens the climate solution space." Westervelt writes about a growing body of research showing that it’s possible to lift people out of poverty and improve living standards across the globe without increasing global fossil fuel consumption.</p>
<p><strong>RENEWABLES ARE ‘A GOOD DEAL’: </strong>One positive takeaway from the report is that in many realms, technological developments that could help us reach a fossil-free-future have advanced rapidly. “The most important top-line message from [the IPCC] to the world: We have the technology we need to create a habitable future available to us right now,” <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/ipcc-renewable-technology-wind-solar">writes Brian Kahn of <em>Protocol</em></a>. “It’s largely money and politics standing in the way of getting to that better place.”</p>
<p>As the costs of wind and solar and batteries continue to plummet, transitioning away from fossil fuels is becoming an increasingly smart economic decision — even without accounting for the massive economic costs that would come with further  exacerbating the climate crisis. Still, the amount of investments in renewables are three to six times below what they need to be this decade, Kahn writes. However, while most technology is being developed and adopted faster than anticipated, nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage have been the exception to this rule. These technologies “have seen minimal cost reductions and their adoption has grown slowly,” according to the IPCC.</p>

<blockquote>“Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” </blockquote>
<p>— U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, in a Monday press conference announcing the report.</p>

<p>Between 2011 and 2021, just four oil companies and their main lobbying group spent more than $450 million lobbying the federal government, according to <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-analysis-of-fossil-fuel-industry-s-lobbying-reveals-public-praise-for#:~:text=The%20four%20oil%20%E2%80%8Bgiants,year%20and%20spent%20%2478%20million.">an analysis</a> from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p>
<p>This stat isn’t from the IPCC report itself (which only barely mentioned the influence of the fossil fuel industry), but illuminates why carbon emissions continue to increase.</p>
<h3 id="flashback">FLASHBACK</h3>
<p>The first IPCC report, published in 1990, was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-ipcc-science-idAFL5N2W34GX">one-tenth the length</a> of this week’s 10,000 page report. Part of the reason for the increase in length: There’s far more academic research to cite on the climate crisis now than there was back in 1990. And yet, annual carbon emissions have increased by about <a href="https://www.axios.com/un-climate-report-takeaways-ed84d4e7-8a2e-4963-bd3a-8f9535f06f1a.html">54 percent</a> since that first report was published.</p>
