A lowered stance tucks those 10-spoke two-tone wheels and the tires wrapped around them quite nicely under the fenders, so this truck looks sharp. Beautiful boards in the payload with a nice stain that’s light enough to show off that wood grain underneath, plus shiny bed strips really put the cherry on top for this ride."

However, modern features also abound, most prominently the front bucket seats with plush bolstering and leather upholstery. The red center line down the seat and back cushions and quilted pattern for the leather inserts add a nice sense of customization. Same goes for the quilted leather door panel inserts. White-faced Dolphin gauges have a nice period look, as does the digital radio with push buttons."
