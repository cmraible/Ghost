More and more of these cars seem to be discovered in a barn, shed, warehouse, or any sort of storage area to try and keep it safe from the elements while the car increases in value. Here we have a 1968 Shelby GT500 Ford Mustang that was found sitting in a warehouse since 2004. "

Under the hood sits a 428 Police Interceptor V8 engine topped with an aluminum mid-rise intake and two four-barrel 600 CFM Holley carburetors. Power is shifted to the rear wheels via a TopLoader 4-speed manual transmission.The car produced 355-brake-horsepower at 5,400-rpm and 420 lb/ft of torque at 3,200-rpm."

Lucky for this classic Shelby GT500 Ford Mustang, it looks like it is going to see the road once again when its restoration is complete. Thankfully, this one didn't become a casualty to the elements or the crusher."
