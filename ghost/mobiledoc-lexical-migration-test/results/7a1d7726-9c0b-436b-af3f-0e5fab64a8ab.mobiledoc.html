<hr>
<p>Although beauty is subjective, there's no denying the fact that the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1974-jaguar-e-type-roadster-auction/">Jaguar E-Type</a> is one of the most beautifully designed cars of all time, but that didn't stop designer <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-chip-foose-work-on-his-1969-chevy-camaro-restomod/">Chip Foose</a> from taking a crack at giving this legendary coupe more of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">hotrod</a> look. We're split on the episodes we've seen so far with Foose <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-redesigns-the-first-gen-ford-bronco/">transforming the first-gen Bronco into an International Scout knockoff</a> but he did manage to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-c5-corvette-redesign/">improve the C5 Corvette</a>, so we definitely wanted to see what he had in store – good or bad – for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1971-jaguar-e-type-v12-auction/">E-Type Coupe</a>.</p>

<p>Focusing on the coupe body style, Foose starts by lowering the rocker panel and giving the A-pillar a shallower rake that angles more toward the front wheels. He also lowered the roof line, added a sleeker shape to the side window openings and put side louvers on the long, forward-hinged hood, but he kept the car's iconic Coke-bottle lines and fast back rear hatch untouched. Foose's "lean and stylized" E-Type ends up looking like a stretched-out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/john-oates-1984-porsche-911/">Porsche 911</a>, but such a modernized E-Type design might look really good applied to a custom <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/features/315848/can-a-four-cylinder-f-type-ever-live-up-to-its-jaguar-heritage">F-Type</a> – similar to what the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/382757/2002-chevrolet-corvette-commemorative-edition">Corvette Commemorative Edition</a> was back in 2002.</p>
<p>Even though we're not in love with the final result, it's always fun to watch an artist showing off their craft. Interestingly, Foose says that his approach for designing a custom car doesn't change whether he's working on a classic Camaro, '32 Ford or even the E-Type.</p>
