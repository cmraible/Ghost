Whilst this game on Switch is best played in handheld mode, the game's mechanics aren't exactly the most complicated, simply requiring you to rearrange blocks, flick switches and exploring the islands to find stars and orbs with the tip of your finger, therefore a cursor to be controlled with the left joystick also suffices just fine. In fact, it may well be preferred as the touchscreen can be a little awkward for precision, especially on the Switch's small screen."
