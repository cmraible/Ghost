Adding to its fancy appeal is the rear-hinged doors and power-retractable Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament. Rain is not an issue for this luxury 'vert with rain-detecting variable intermittent wipers with heated jets. This convertible also features heated mirrors that automatically dim with tilt-down and power folding along with directionally adaptive headlamps with washer and delay-off. Black brake calipers can be found behind the silver 10-spoke alloy wheels."
