<p><a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">Even as ten Corvettes</a> from the collection that has been passed around New York since 1989 have already been restored and raffled, there is plenty of time for Motorious readers to put their names in the hat for the <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">26 remaining cars</a>. The <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">Lost Corvettes Collection</a>, or Peter Max Collection, includes an example of each model year from the very beginning to 1988. Surprisingly enough, this is not the first time these cars have been given away. In 1989, the cars were raffled as a whole to Long Island carpenter, Dennis Amadeo who in turn sold the collection to Peter Max.</p>
