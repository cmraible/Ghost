<hr>
<p>The debate about which is better, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">American muscle cars</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">Japanese performance cars</a> has been waged since the 1990s. For some it’s a simple question of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jeep-most-patriotic-brand/">patriotic allegiance</a> or the need to go with a perceived counter cultural take on everything. However, when a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">Dodge Challenger Hellcat</a> lines up against a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-r35-c6-corvette/">Nissan GT-R R35</a> at a drag strip, ultimately it all comes down to the cars and the drivers.</p>
<blockquote><em>Watch a Dodge Hellcat outrun the cops <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driver-outruns-cops-hellcat/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>These faceoffs are so interesting because the cars involved are so very different. The obvious thing is one is built in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/900-hp-nissan-r34/">Japan</a> and the other is built in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/muscle-car-production-ceases/">Canada</a>(yep, not the US) by an American-Italian-French automaker.</p>

<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-smokes-cops/">Hellcat’s approach to performance</a> has some old-school style but with some modern technologies. The supercharged 6.2-liter V8 uses 21st Century designs to push out a monstrous 707-horsepower, that is in factory form. We don’t know if this one has been modified, but that’s always a possibility. The rear-wheel-drive layout is pretty old school, making it a little hard to get a good portion of that power to the tires, not to mention prevent wheelspin from a standstill. The driver needs to be fairly skilled to manage this Mopar, especially if it comes with the manual transmission.</p>
<p>As for the R35 GT-R, it’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-r32-skyline-r35-gt-r/">technologically-advanced machine</a> one could call a supercar. Some think it’s so advanced anyone could drag race it without any preparation and do just fine. That might be oversimplifying things a bit, but the fact it boasts a fairly advanced all-wheel-drive system does make it easier to hook up and get down the track in a hurry. The hand-built turbocharged V6 engine is a masterpiece with somewhere around 565-600-hp on tap, depending on the model. However, that mill takes to aggressive modifications quite well, and we don’t know if anything on these Godzillas has been tweaked.</p>
