<p>As we previously announced, tonight at 7:30 pm ET (4:30 pm PT),<em> Daily Poster </em>paying subscribers will chat with <em>New York Times</em> reporter Peter S. Goodman about his new book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/davos-man-how-the-billionaires-devoured-the-world/9780063078307"><em>Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World</em></a>.</p>
<p>In <em>Davos Man</em>, Goodman, who was Sirota’s editor at <em>International Business Times,</em> delivers a searing exposé of how the global billionaire class has engineered a bottom-up transfer of wealth that has transformed 21st-century life and dangerously destabilized democracy. The book lays bare the roots of Trump, Brexit, and anti-democratic movements sweeping the globe, exposing how wealthy executives perpetuated the agony of the pandemic by monopolizing the benefits of COVID vaccines and laying the groundwork for the rise of Omicron.</p>
<p>In advance of the live event, you can read excerpts of the book at the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/business/davos-man-marc-benioff-book.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> and at<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/01/how-klaus-schwab-built-a-billionaire-circus-at-davos"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Like all our live chats, the event is exclusively for </strong><strong>Daily Poster paying subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcast live, ask questions in real time, and watch a replay of the event.</strong></em></p>
