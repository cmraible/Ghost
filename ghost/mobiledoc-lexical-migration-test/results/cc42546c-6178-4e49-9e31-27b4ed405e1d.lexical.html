<p>If you're not familiar with the online culture around comics and games - you should be. The "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/gamergate/">GamerGate</a>" crisis of six years ago was a sandbox where many of the techniques used by online populist movements were refined - and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/01/gamergate-alt-right-hate-trump">then deployed to devastating effect in mainstream politics</a>. </p>
<p>It's worth paying attention to <em>now</em> because there's been a rolling exposure of historic abuse and manipulation through online and offline communities. One of the latest figures to be accused is Warren Ellis - whose work has spread beyond comics into film and TV. </p>

            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">Comic book writer, novelist and TV writer Warren Ellis has been accused of ‚Äògrooming‚Äô much younger women, only to deceive and use them.</div>

<p>What's interesting about Ellis, as compared to some of <a href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/jason-latour-misconduct-allegations/">the</a><a href="https://www.cbr.com/cameron-stewart-grooming-allegations/">others</a>, is that he has long been a talented community developer. His <a href="https://imagecomics.com/features/an-oral-history-of-the-warren-ellis-forum-part-i">Warren Ellis forum</a> was a hub of both fans and creatives in the comics and geek media space in the early 2000s, and he's repeated the <a href="http://www.avatarpress.com/2007/11/whitechapel-the-long-awaited-new-warren-ellis-community-is-here/">formula more than once</a>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The fact that he was using his disproportionate position of power to solicit younger women for sex is significantly less good. It's interesting to note that his communities have been centred around his own persona. There's a narcissistic touch there, that looks - to me, at least - like one of the alarm bells. Many analyses of trolling suggest that there's <a href="https://dradambell.com/why-people-become-internet-trolls/">a dark tetrad of characteristics</a> that lead to toxic behaviour. When the community organiser is gathering people around himself, these characteristics may well be amplified. </p>
<h3 id="the-architecture-of-ego">The architecture of ego</h3>
<p>We've built a digital infrastructure that tends to favour the construction of personal brands. Ellis was a pioneer here, but you can see it in the cult of personality around influencers, youTubers and steamers.</p>
<p>And some of those streamers are following Ellis's example in more way than one:</p>

<p>There are soe very clear problems with people building such power and influence around themselves. It's also good that we're finally seeing some consequence for abuse of that. </p>
<p>But we also need to think about ways of stopping it taking decades to expose these people ‚Äî and if so willingly giving ourselves over to these developing cults of personality is a healthy activity in the first place. </p>

Thanks to my daughters, I'm in danger of becoming a bit of a Brony myself ‚Äî I can hold forth intelligently on the subtle differences between the Mane Six and their Equestria Girls counterparts if needed ‚Äî but the idea that people could take the central message of these cartoons and make them facist is‚Ä¶</p>
