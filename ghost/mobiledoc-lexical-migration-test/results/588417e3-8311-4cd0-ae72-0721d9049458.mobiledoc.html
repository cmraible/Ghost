<hr>
<p>Believe it or not, Porsche has been around as a brand since 1948. This year the German automaker is be turning 72, a big milestone many will be wanting to celebrate. To get everyone excited for the upcoming festivities, Porsche has revealed a behind-the-scenes look at the birthday party, which involved three iconic models from the Porsche Museum congregating in a rustic garage.</p>
<p>Porsche really knows its fans and hits the highlight for each era of its history. First up is the Porsche 718 RS 60 Spyder. It’s been 60 years since the debut of this motorsports legend, which many feel was the pinnacle of the automaker’s aluminum spyder racers. A small yet potent engine paired with lightweight construction made for a potent setup. It wasn’t uncommon to see these running with and beating other race cars with twice the displacement, seriously embarrassing rivals.</p>
<p>The second car featured in the behind-the-scenes footage is the Porsche 993 Turbo. A quarter of a century ago these were the last of the air-cooled Porsche 911 Turbo models made, closing the books on an era so many wax nostalgic about to this day. This version of the Turbo was vastly improved over previous iterations, and we can thank the legendary Porsche 959 for that. The 993 Turbo borrowed the all-wheel drive system and twin-turbo setup from the supercar, but it still retained the wild nature everyone came to expect from the previous Turbos.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to see the beauty and modern grace of the Porsche 918 Spyder. It’s hard to believe, but this marks the 10<sup>th</sup>anniversary for this hybrid supercar. When it debuted as a concept at the Geneva Motor Show in 2010 people were floored by the advanced powertrain and the undeniably gorgeous looks. It also has outstanding performance chops, with Car and Driver clocking a 0-60 acceleration time of 2.2 seconds.</p>
<p>These three classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/porsches-to-buy-now/">Porsches</a> are absolutely perfect for chronicling how Porsche has evolved as a brand. While many others absolutely could have been included, we’ll just assume logistics limited the number to three.</p>
