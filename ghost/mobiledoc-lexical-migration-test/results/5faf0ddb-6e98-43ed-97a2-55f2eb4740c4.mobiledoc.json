Apparently police in the Czech Republic have never heard that, because they’re using a confiscated 2011 Ferrari 458 Italia to run down street racers, car thieves, and other suspects in high-powered performance cars. After releasing a promotional video that plays almost like a movie trailer, there’s plenty of buzz about this interesting law enforcement strategy."

Then they added the obligatory blue and yellow reflective striping and a low-profile lightbar on the roof, along with other blue and red lights to make it clear to everyone this is indeed a police car."

You see, they’re exercising restraint by living every 13-year-old boy’s fantasy. Other cars seized by the police have been resold, the proceeds used to cover damages done by criminals. So you see, it doesn’t hurt if they keep just one little old Ferrari."
