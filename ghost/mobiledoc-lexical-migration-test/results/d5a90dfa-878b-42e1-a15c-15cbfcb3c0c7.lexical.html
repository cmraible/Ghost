<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We’re right now on the verge of having enough resources to bring on new reporters and create a new freelance fund for TMI — so here’s my ask:</p>
<p><strong>Can you <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> and become a supporting subscriber?</strong></p>
<p>If you want to understand why this is important, just see our recent work: in just the last week, one of our big stories <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1288210894753734657?s=20">shamed a Republican state government</a> into change its Covid reporting, and another <a href="__GHOST_URL__/scoop-senate-gop-copied-and-pasted-25d">investigation</a> proved that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s corporate-written provisions were just pasted into Senate Republicans’ new pandemic bill. And we’ve got another set of scoops coming soon.</p>
<p>These are stories that corporate- and billionaire-owned media don’t focus on — which is why we are building this grassroots-funded model of journalism. To do this reporting, we need sustainable resources — which means we need as many monthly and annual paying subscribers as possible.</p>
<p>And here’s the other thing: when you become a supporting subscriber, you get all sorts of exclusive subscriber-only content.</p>
<p><strong>So please, go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> and pitch in.</strong></p>
<p>I know that when we hear the term “media,” we think of a system where we just sit here waiting for corporate- and billionaire-owned outlets to hopefully once-in-a-while do a good story. But in these crazy times, we’re going to have to build a new model that is far more aggressive and far more independent. That’s what we’re doing with this project — and it is having real success.</p>
<p>Help us continue doing impact reporting — and create a model of truly independent journalism that scrutinizes the power of corporations, billionaires and both parties’ establishments.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this request.</p>
