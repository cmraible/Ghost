Each level persists of fighting waves of various enemies on a 2D plane until the game tells you to move forward with a huge “GO” sign flashing on the screen, as if you’re a child and don’t know how video games work. Each character has a punch, kick, gun and special buttons which can be chained together to form many interesting combos. These also change depending on which direction you’re holding which is something a lot of classic beat ’em ups didn’t have."

Unless you are constantly looking at where each character’s feet are, you will consistently misjudge where you are on the 2D plane and miss your attacks. That being said, the game does have some leniency on the hitbox of your attacks but there are times when even that will fail you. I had times where I was nowhere near the enemy and yet I was still hitting them and other times where I was right in front of them and attacks refused to connect."

Melee weapons like crowbars or katanas don’t follow up into combos and are more for keeping large groups of enemies down but if you run into the aforementioned depth perception troubles and miss your swing, you are left wide open to attacks. You can also find rifles in these boxes but using them feels really clunky. To use a gun, you have to hold down ZR to take it out and then A to fire it; in the time it takes you to pull out the gun, enemies can easily get within melee range and hit you out of gun mode. Consequently, you then then need to back up and hope you’re far enough away that the enemies won’t catch up to you by the time you start shooting."

Story-wise, each level plays out the same; you fight a bunch of dudes down a hallway, fight a boss, beat him into the dirt, yell “WHERE'S VANESSA!!!”, get info on the next location from the boss, explosion, repeat until Venessa is found."
