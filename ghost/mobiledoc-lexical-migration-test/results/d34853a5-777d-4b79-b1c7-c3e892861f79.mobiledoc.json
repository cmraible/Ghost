You’re justified in asking who would neglect such an amazing machine, because it should be considered criminal negligence. The next question which always enters our mind is what will it take to bring the car back to its original state? And that’s where things get complicated with this and so many other abandoned classic cars."

When YouTube channel Auto Archeology tried to open the hood, it actually broke in three different parts from all the rust. The wheels and tires are sunk into the ground, which comes up to the rocker panels, almost like the Dodge is being swallowed up ever so slowly."

This particular one still has its 383ci Magnum V8, although it’s obviously nowhere near ready to fire up and go for a drive. Someone would really have to love this Mopar to get it back into original condition, because it’s going to need some serious work."

He made a huge impact on the muscle car scene, particularly the Mopars, using his Chicago Dodge dealership to make modified versions of vehicles we love. That someone would spend the extra money for such a machine to later just let it sit and rot is a crying shame."
