<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We need your help — and I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
<p>We are very close to implementing a plan to expand TMI and our accountability journalism, but to do that, we need as many free subscribers to pitch in and become supporting subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>If you like the accountability journalism we are doing, please: go to <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>sirota.substack.com/subscribe</strong></a> and become a monthly or an annual supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>As you may have seen, we’ve been expanding our roster of contributors and we’ve been breaking big stories with real impact. We’ve been doing the hard work of original journalism that exposes corruption and challenges power.</p>
<p>We are able to do this because we are a GRASSROOTS FUNDED — we don’t rely on corporations or advertisement revenue. We rely on small-dollar subscribers, because we know that will allow us to do the kind of independent journalism that is so necessary in this day and age.</p>
<p>We are now seeing the success of this model — we are producing reporting that is shaming powerful politicians. And we can do much more of this — but we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Please <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here to become a supporting subscriber</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks so much for considering this.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
