Matched up to it is a four-speed manual, so as you can imagine this is one fun car to take around town. What’s more, under the hood everything is incredibly clean, with red valve covers and chrome air cleaner for an impressive presentation."

It rolls around with chromed bumpers, pop up headlights, driver’s side mirror, and side exhaust pipes. It rolls on 15-inch Rally wheels, wrapped in 205/75 Coker Classic red wall tires. It gets stopping power from power four-wheel disc brakes. Both the suspension and the brakes were overhauled."
