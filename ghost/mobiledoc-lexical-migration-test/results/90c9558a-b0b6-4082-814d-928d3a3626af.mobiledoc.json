          "A Tesla Model 3 driving at over 100 mph in Corvallis, Oregon recently crashed late at night. The heavy sedan sheared a power pole at its base, according to police. It also knocked over two trees instead of saving them, plus took out a telephone junction box. That wasn’t even close to the end of the carnage as the electric car ripped open and flung batteries like shrapnel."
