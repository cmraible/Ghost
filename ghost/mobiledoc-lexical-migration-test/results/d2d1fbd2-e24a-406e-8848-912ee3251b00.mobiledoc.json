They’re common sights in Southern California, so it was only a matter of time before one was involved in a police chase and was the target of a PIT maneuver. What led up to that doesn’t seem entirely clear, so let’s jump into it."

California Highway Patrol led the chase after the vehicle, which stretched into Orange County. The chase came to a bizarre end when the Tesla driver suddenly stopped on the highway in Newport Beach. We’re not sure if maybe the battery charge was low or if the guy was trying to pull some sort of stunt, because if so it was a bad move."

It sort of works as the electric car does almost a quarter spin, although the driver straightened it out quickly. From the video, the Tesla didn’t appear to be going fast at all, so that makes doing a PIT on a car effectively far more difficult."
