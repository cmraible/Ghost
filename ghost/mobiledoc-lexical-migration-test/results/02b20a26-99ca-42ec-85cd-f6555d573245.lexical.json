That explains the low ride height and mean stance. There are few exterior cosmetic changes, but the headlights are hidden behind the grille for a sleeker appearance. Oh, and there’s a rack added to the flatbed, so that distracts from the more aggressive changes, maintaining some of that wolf in sheep’s clothing vibe.",
