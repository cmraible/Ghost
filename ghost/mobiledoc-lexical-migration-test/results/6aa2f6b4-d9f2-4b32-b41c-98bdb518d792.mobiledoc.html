<h2 id="enter-facestack">Enter FaceStack</h2>
<p>Substack and newsletters become a big thing, so clearly the Zuckercopier has been fired up to clone the product. Facebook has provided <a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/supporting-independent-voices">a little more detail</a> on its forthcoming newsletter/creator monetisation offering. </p>
<p>While I can see why Facebook is doing this, and why it might seem like an attractive idea to do this from some creators' point of view, the idea of the whole — or even a substantial chunk — of my income being dependent on Facebook's good will brings me out in hives. </p>
<p>I see no sign here that Facebook will make it easy to move your subscribers, and their billing details, if you ever moved platform. Risky. </p>

<h2 id="from-0-to-140000-newsletter-revenue-in-a-year">From $0 to $140,000 newsletter revenue in a year</h2>
<p>Talking of newsletter revenue, bloody hell, look at this:</p>
<blockquote>Geekout was launched in June 2020 (nine months ago). It’s now on track to generate $140,000 in sponsorship and ad revenue in its first year.</blockquote>
<p>There's two people working on it. That's a pretty lucrative side-hustle. Interesting that the revenue is ad-based: looks like social media managers are a spendy market to target. </p>

<p>Once again, we see that social media — and Facebook in particular — can allow a small group of people to have an outsize impact on public discourse. </p>
