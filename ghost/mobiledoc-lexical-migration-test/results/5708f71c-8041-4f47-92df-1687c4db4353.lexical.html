<p>Had a fun day yesterday, running a bespoke training course for a property industry client with the talented, genial (and caustically funny) <a href="http://vadamedia.co.uk">Steve Bustin of Vada Media</a>. Watching Steve – a former stand-up comedian – at work reminded me how much entertaining the people you are training helps in engaging them – and thus making the training more effective.</p>
<p>I’ll be doing my best to bring that to the two public training courses I’m running with journalism.co.uk over the next few weeks:</p>
<h2 id="liveblogging-%E2%80%93-next-wednesday-evening">Liveblogging – next Wednesday evening</h2>
<p>As the last news:rewired <a href="http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2012/07/life_in_the_livestream_liveblogging_and.html">made clear</a>, live coverage of events is  becoming more and more important. This evening course is designed to give you all the skills you need to get started in the various styles of liveblogging – a vital component of any journalist or content creator’s armoury.</p>
<p>I believe there are still <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/liveblogging-course-for-journalists/s352/">a few places left on the course</a>, and I’d be delighted to see you along there.</p>
<h2 id="seo-for-journalists-and-content-creators-%E2%80%93-20th-september">SEO for Journalists (and content creators) – 20th September</h2>
<p>I ran this course earlier in the year, really enjoyed it. Feedback from the attendees was good, which is always encouraging. This is very much a hands-on guide for content creators, particularly journalists, who want to know how to make sure their websites look as good as possible to search engines. It’s not designed to turn you into an SEO “guru”, it’s designed to give content experts the SEO tools they need. And yes, it’s a Panda- and Penguin-ready course. (And if you don’t know what that means, you need the course. 😉  )</p>
