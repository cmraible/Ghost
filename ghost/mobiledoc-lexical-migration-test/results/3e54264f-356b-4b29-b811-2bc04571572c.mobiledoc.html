<p>Good things are happening! A historic new program in California aims to usher in the next generation of community-based reporters. Also, Louisiana organizers celebrated a victory for their collective health, stopping the completion of a so-called “Cancer Alley” petrochemical complex. Meanwhile, Oakland takes a stand for Indigenous rights by returning stolen land, and a German experiment in reimagining public transit is having an immense impact on carbon emissions.</p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em>, available below.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="the-largest-state-funded-boost-to-local-journalism">The Largest State-Funded Boost To Local Journalism</h3>
<p>In what may be the <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/09/07/state-funds-berkeley-journalism-25-million-to-strengthen-californias-local-news-coverage/">largest state-based allocation</a> ever made to support local journalism, UC Berkeley is set to receive $25 million to fund reporting across California, especially in communities historically cut off from strong local journalism. The funding will create nearly 40 fellowships with $50,000 yearly stipends for reporters to work for a local newsroom in the state. </p>
<p>Funds for the fellowship program are coming from <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/09/06/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-6-22/">California Assembly Bill 179</a>, which was signed into law on September 6 and championed by Democratic state Sen. Steve Glazer. “Studies have shown that democracies thrive when people feel connected to their communities and have local journalism to engage with,” Steven Harmon, a spokesperson for Glazer <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2022/09/12/uc-berkeley-graduate-school-of-journalism-receives-25m-state-fund-to-strengthen-local-news-coverage/">told</a><em>The Daily Californian</em>. “That’s what we hope this new fellowship program can do in California. It should be a model for the nation.”</p>

<p>Between 2008 and 2020, U.S. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/13/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-fallen-26-since-2008/">newsroom employment</a> shrank by 26 percent. UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism Dean Geeta Anand said the new funding will support underrepresented reporters. “We want local journalism to flourish by being able to hire talented journalists from different backgrounds who focus on communities that aren’t fully represented or given a voice in current news coverage,” she <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/09/07/state-funds-berkeley-journalism-25-million-to-strengthen-californias-local-news-coverage/">told</a><em>Berkeley News</em>.</p>
<h3 id="organizers-beat-back-%E2%80%9Ccancer-alley%E2%80%9D-petrochemical-complex">Organizers Beat Back “Cancer Alley” Petrochemical Complex</h3>
<p>After years of resistance, community organizers in St. James, Louisiana, <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/community-organizers-celebrate-defeat-of-petrochemical-complex-in-cancer-alley/">celebrated</a> their victory over South Louisiana Methanol (SLM), stopping the company from completing a local $2.2 billion petrochemical complex in a region known by residents as “<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/09/17/life-cancer-alley">Cancer Alley</a>” because of dangerous amounts of carcinogens produced by industrial pollution in the area. The celebration follows the St. James’ District Council <a href="https://thelensnola.org/2022/09/01/methanol-company-on-its-own-to-resolve-stalled-2-2-billion-project-after-st-james-parish-rejects-rezoning-bid/">decision</a> to reject other industrial uses for the land, like plastics production and methanol processing.</p>
<p>“South Louisiana Methanol finally threw in the towel having learned that our community will not back down in the fight to protect our health and wellbeing from more industrial pollution,” said Sharon Lavigne, founder of <a href="https://www.stopformosa.org/">RISE St. James</a>, a leading group in the fight against SLM. “Today is a tremendous victory, but we will never stop fighting against polluters who think our health is less important than their dirty profits.”</p>

<h3 id="oakland-land-to-be-returned-to-indigenous-stewardship">Oakland Land To Be Returned To Indigenous Stewardship</h3>
<p>The city of Oakland <a href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2022/sogorea-te-land-trust-and-city-of-oakland-announce-plan-to-return-land-to-indigenous-stewardship">plans</a> to return five acres of land to Indigenous stewardship. This week, the city hosted community meetings to explain the project to residents. If approved, the plan would transfer the <a href="https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/city-of-oakland-announces-plan-to-return-land-to-indigenous-stewardship">land</a> to the East Bay Ohlone Tribe, Confederated Villages of Lisjan Nation, and <a href="https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/">Sogorea Te’ Land Trust</a>, an Indigenous women-led group based in San Francisco. The Sogorea Te’ Land Trust had previously created a <a href="https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/caring-for-the-land/">community garden</a> for Indigenous youth in East Oakland as part of their efforts to reclaim Indigenous land.</p>
<p>“I am committed to returning land to Indigenous stewardship, to offer some redress for past injustices to Native people,” Mayor Schaaf said in a <a href="https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/oakland-plans-to-return-land-to-indigenous-group">statement</a>. “I hope the work we are doing in Oakland with the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust can serve as a model for other cities working to return Indigenous land to the Indigenous community we stole it from.”</p>
<h3 id="low-cost-public-transit-cut-carbon-emissions">Low-Cost Public Transit Cut Carbon Emissions</h3>
<p>In a three-month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-30/germany-s-ultra-cheap-train-ticket-saved-1-8-million-tons-of-co2">experiment</a>, Germany created a 9-euro ($9) monthly ticket for subways, regional trains, and buses — a move that prevented 1.8 million tons of  carbon dioxide emissions, or the equivalent of powering roughly 350,000 homes for one year. While the transit program was rolled out to help people in light of <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/relief-faq-2065498">inflation</a> and <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2022/03/PE22_N016_61.html#:~:text=Imported%20energy%20cost%20129.5%25%20more,Federal%20Statistical%20Office%20(Destatis).">higher energy costs</a> created by the war in Ukraine, the program’s short stint had an outsized impact in reducing climate emissions. Conversations about how to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7a9973cd-ea91-42a9-a79f-4a8c5bf93500">continue</a> the program are ongoing, with some leaders — like leader of the Social Democrats Lars Klingbeil — calling for a tax on windfall profits to provide funding.</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read a Rita Dove’s poem about creative energy, <em>“</em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-05-05-bk-2047-story.html"><em>Ars Poetica</em></a><em>”</em>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><em>Thirty miles to the only decent restaurant<br>was nothing, a blink<br>in the long dull stare of Wyoming.<br>Halfway there the unknown but terribly<br>important essayist yelled Stop!<br>I wanna be in this; and walked<br>fifteen yards onto the land<br>before sky bore down and he came running,<br>crying Jesus--there’s nothing out there!<br><br>I once met an Australian novelist<br>who told me he never learned to cook<br>because it robbed creative energy.<br>What he wanted most was<br>to be mute; he stacked up pages;<br>he entered each day with an ax.<br><br>What I want is this poem to be small,<br>a ghost town<br>on the larger map of wills.<br>Then you can pencil me in as a hawk:<br>a traveling x-marks-the-spot.</em><!--kg-card-end: html-->
