That’s certainly a possibility, but it’s also possible thieves stole the cars to commit other crimes, returning to same place to dump them to get rid of evidence. In the end, we don’t know but we’d imagine authorities might want to check out both possibilities."

From there, the insurers can decide what they want to do with these vehicles, like the vintage Hyundai left underwater for over a decade. Call it a hunch, but we think scrap metal is about all these cars are good for at this point."

Also, you might want to take extra precautions to secure your car. And don’t commit insurance fraud since we all end up paying for that. Also, we have yet to see any stories about collectable Hyundais, so that wasn’t a huge loss, although who knows what the future might bring?"
