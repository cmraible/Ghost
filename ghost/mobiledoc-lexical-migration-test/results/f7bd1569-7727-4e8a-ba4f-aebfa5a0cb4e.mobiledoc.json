Depending on your opinion of what constitutes vehicle performance, you’ll view this as either impressive or ridiculous. We just think the NSX isn’t good at burnouts or donuts, or maybe they have the wrong tires."

In one of them, a guy tries doing a stationary burnout, which produces a much better result. In that video he’s “getting rid of old tires” so maybe the lack of traction is a contributing factor. Whatever the reason, seeing an NSX get abused this way is fun to watch."
