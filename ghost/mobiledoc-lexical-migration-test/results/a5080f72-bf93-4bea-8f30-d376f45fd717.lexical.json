Auto Racing had taken off in Europe, and buyers wanted something to reflect the hunger for speed that now engulfed the growing sports car market. For Germany, the prancy pony of performance was the frontrunner in the charge to take the hearts and minds of automotive enthusiasts across the globe. This goal was accomplished quite well, especially with cars such as the 911, which pioneered the path for similar lightweight sports cars whose primary focus was on the experience of driving and all of the pleasures that come with that. This car perfectly epitomizes that intense concentration on giving the driver a beautifully crafted ride.",
