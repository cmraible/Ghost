<p>There’s not too much to take solace in right now. But even during weeks like this, it’s important to focus on the possibility of a better future — or at least a future in which matters are not getting markedly worse.</p>
<p>People have always, currently are, and will be fighting for change in climates much more adverse than what we face in this country today. Prior to passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, labor organizers all across the country were frequently beaten, tortured, and killed. The South during Jim Crow was a fascist police state where anybody, and especially Black folks, organizing for change could face lynching or execution.</p>
<p>But as Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”</p>
<p>All of this is to say that it’s never over until it’s over. Humanity is worth fighting for — we’re alive aren’t we? As Mother Jones said, “Mourn for the dead — fight like hell for the living.”</p>
<p>That’s the basis of the stories we’re highlighting in this week’s <em>You Love to See It</em>: In the face of extraordinary adversity, ordinary people are taking action in their communities and at their jobs to stop the nihilists from winning the day.</p>
<p>We’ve got Starbucks workers scoring new victories, Massachusetts’ high court compelling ExxonMobil to face justice, the SEC cracking down on greenwashing, and the Washington D.C. government taking on disgustingly large SUVs.</p>
<p>All that and more for this week’s <em>You Love to See It, </em>exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="massachusetts%E2%80%99-high-court-takes-on-exxon">Massachusetts’ High Court Takes On Exxon</h3>
<p>In 2019, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sued ExxonMobil over the fact that it had long known about the climate crisis and its own role in making the problem worse. The fossil fuel giant sought to get the case thrown out of court, using a state law designed to prevent frivolous lawsuits against journalists and claiming the company was engaged in protected speech.</p>
<p>But this week, Massachusetts’ high court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/exxon-trial-climate-crimes-fossil-fuels-global-heating">rejected</a> Exxon’s spurious argument and allowed the lawsuit to go forward. There will now be a trial in a lower court to determine what Exxon knew and when it knew it — and the results could expose the company to enormous financial liability for misleading investors and the public.</p>
<h3 id="financial-regulators-tackle-greenwashing">Financial Regulators Tackle Greenwashing</h3>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the nation’s top financial regulator, has finally begun to crack down on greenwashing, the practice by which corporations attempt to depict their poor environmental practices as environmentally sound. On Wednesday, the SEC <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff0097c4-3f1c-49d8-8189-153fc56aeeb3?emailId=628cb6d629197800233f2236&segmentId=13b7e341-ed02-2b53-e8c0-d9cb59be8b3b">fined</a> the bank BNY Mellon $1.5 million for misstating and failing to include information in its mutual fund lineup about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) options. According to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-86">SEC</a>, BNY Mellon “represented or implied in various statements that all investments in the funds had undergone an ESG quality review, even though that was not always the case.”</p>
<p>This is part of a planned <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fefdb2c-f72e-4e52-b95b-c0727aeb1a94?emailId=628cb6d629197800233f2236&segmentId=13b7e341-ed02-2b53-e8c0-d9cb59be8b3b">broader</a> crackdown on Wall Street’s practice of labeling products and investments as “ESG” options, despite little evidence to back up the claims.</p>
<h3 id="dc-council-cracks-down-on-giant-suvs">D.C. Council Cracks Down On Giant SUVs</h3>
<p>Have you noticed that trucks and SUVs are getting bigger and uglier? In response, the D.C. Council has finally implemented a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">surcharge</a> on these monstrosities, making their owners of vehicles that weigh more than 6,000 pounds pay an additional $500 annually to register their vehicle. As Councilwoman Mary Cheh noted, “The size and weight of these vehicles has become ginormous… When cars and pedestrians or cyclists come into contact, we know that the heavier the car, the worse the accident will be.”</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/bigger-vehicles-are-directly-resulting-in-more-deaths-of-people-walking/">found</a> that in 2015, pedestrians were two to three times “more likely to suffer a fatality when struck by an SUV or pickup than when struck by a passenger car.”</p>
<h3 id="labor-backed-coalition-forces-accountability">Labor-Backed Coalition Forces Accountability</h3>
<p>One of our favorite organizations over here at <em>The Lever </em>is Jobs to Move America, a strategic policy center that aims to use the public procurement process for goods and services to ensure that good jobs are created in underinvested communities. The organization just <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/05/26/new-flyer-benefits-bus-equity/">scored</a> a major win, settling a lawsuit against Canadian bus company New Flyer for failing to create the number of meaningful jobs they promised when they negotiated a contract with the Los Angeles public transit system in 2013. Thanks to the settlement, New Flyer has agreed to do independent harassment resolution for workers at the plant and additional safety training, as well as other benefits. Congratulations to Jobs to Move America for a job well done.</p>
<h3 id="teachers-protest-the-nra">Teachers Protest the NRA</h3>
<p>The leaders of the nation’s two main teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/26/teacher-union-nra-convetion?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_content=politics-guns">protesting</a> the National Rifle Association’s annual convention in Houston this weekend and opposing deranged Republican proposals to arm teachers. Perhaps it was a bad idea for education “reformers” and conservatives to demonize teachers unions, and blame them for everything wrong with public schools?</p>
<h3 id="starbucks-worker-victories">Starbucks Worker Victories</h3>
<p>This week, Starbucks workers won union victories in Pittsburgh, Pa.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Knoxville, Tenn ;Portland, Ore.; Chicago, Ill; Independence, Mo.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Louisville, and Buffalo, N.Y. In total, as Matt Bruenig <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBruenig/status/1529867680932581377">points out</a>, Starbucks Workers United, the labor union representing Starbucks workers, has now won 87 union elections in a little over six months and boasts more than 2,200 members. According to Law360’s unionization <a href="https://twitter.com/dcmichaelrose/status/1516799963770109964">tracker</a>, 184 more Starbucks union elections are on the way.</p>
