In 1993, this car was stripped and resprayed using orange acrylic urethane, and the car received a new rear bumper and seals at the same time. A new front bumper and later-style adjustable door mirrors were added in 2000. In May 2019, the driver's door and hood were adjusted for a perfect fit, and it was given new hatch struts, hood pins, and hatch pin guides. A set of Rota wheels (16x8) on all four corners wrapped with Dunlop Direzza ZIII rubber (225/45) further complement its exterior. "
