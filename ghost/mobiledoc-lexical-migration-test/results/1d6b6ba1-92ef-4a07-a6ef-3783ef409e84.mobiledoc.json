Although it lacks any of the intricate details of the stripe packages that Dodge offered in 2017, the simple white and black color scheme is very fitting. This particular example is equipped with the highly desirable aero package complete with the enormous front and rear spoilers. While there is not a whole lot of information about the car, it does appear to be in good condition so if you are in the market for a 2017 Dodge Viper this could be your chance.
