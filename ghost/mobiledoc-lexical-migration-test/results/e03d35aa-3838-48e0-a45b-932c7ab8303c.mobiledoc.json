Currently, The Collection sells several premium brands under one roof in 350,000 square feet of retail space, not an unusual arrangement since quite a few six-digit vehicles are quite the niche offerings."

In the court filing, the dealer says the areas are “remote, suburban locations” which would present “relatively zero market for Porsches” due to the local demographics. For those reasons, The Collection decided to not comply with the requests."

However, Porsche claims pool cars constitute no more than 20 percent of inventory at a dealership and are 100 percent discretionary, so its decisions there weren’t discriminatory but instead reflect how it “rewards dealers.”"
