The design brilliantly allowed for two pistons instead of one, with a 360-degree crankshaft, allowing for bigger displacement. That in turn meant more power and dramatically quickened acceleration. While Triumph originally started working on the design in 1913, WWI made tabling it a necessity. The idea wasn’t revisited until the 1930s, with the first Triumph Speed Twin launching in 1938. After the close of WWII, the parallel twin engine design was adopted by many other motorcycle companies, forever changing how people got around on two wheels.",
