As Kristine pointed out, it had a[ dumb, dumb headline](http://kristinelowe.blogs.com/kristine_lowe/2008/05/when-exactly-did-reading-news-become-an-altruistic-gesture.html), but there were several real gems of information in there.\n\n<div></div><div>Here’s one every web editor and magazine publisher should study and think about:</div><div> </div>> <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">In 2004, about 40% of people visited a homepage and then drilled down to where they wanted to go and 60% use a deep link that took them directly to a page or destination inside a site. In 2008, said Dr Nielsen, only 25% of people travel via a homepage. The rest search and get straight there.</span>\n\n> <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">  \n> </span>\n\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">All that time you’re lavishing on your web site’s front page? Only a quarter of your visitors are using it. And that number is shrinking every day.</span></span>\n\n<div></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">Every single page in your site is your home page. Start designing (and writing) for that fact.</span></span></div>\n"
