There’s something about the unpredictable nature of them, what with criminals who suddenly just open fire as they approach, combined with other drivers who don’t pay attention and plow right over officers as they stand on the side of the road. Plus, a lot of people are just plain rude to police when they’re pulled over, as if the officer did something wrong and not them. That’s why we’re shocked to see this badge cam footage of a police officer in the Cleveland, Ohio area who was totally cool to a Chevy Camaro driver after he caught the guy doing over 120 mph.",
