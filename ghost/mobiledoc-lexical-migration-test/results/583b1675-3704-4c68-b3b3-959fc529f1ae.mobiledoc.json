          "In the1960s, Ford had one goal in mind when it came to road and track racing, and that was sending Enzo Ferrari home to Italy with a loss on his belt. Fortunately, this goal was struck entirely out of the park when Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles helped create one of America's most significant Le Man's competitors ever to hit the asphalt. Fortunately, this legendary car was made easily accessible to the general public in 2005 with an MSRP of just $149,995, which was a relatively low price for such an incredibly high-powered, historic supercar like this one. Nowadays, these cars have become icons from the silver screen, and their vast reputation for high-performance Americans made fun. "
