<h3 id="check-out-this-1971-chevy-ck-k-20-thats-currently-up-for-grabs-at-39990">Check out this 1971 Chevy C/K K-20 that's currently up for grabs at $39,990</h3>
<p>This incredibly late second-generation <a href="https://www.grclassics.com/vehicles/242/1972-chevrolet-k-20?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1971 Chevrolet C/K K-20</a> presents the very best of ‘egg crate’ Chevy trucks; so-called after the fresh grille design implemented on the 1971 model year, for those unfamiliar with American automotive culture. <br><br><strong>More Chevys! </strong><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/this-chevy-el-camino-redefines-utility-vehicles">This Chevy El Camino Redefines Utility Vehicles</a><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/only-six-of-these-top-whack-1969-chevrolet-biscaynes-ever-existed">Only Six Of These Top Whack 1969 Chevrolet Biscaynes Ever Existed</a></p>
<p>For collectors, this slight tweak to the aesthetic design makes all the difference. Manufactured for only a short time in this form, further differentiating aspects from the previous incarnation include a different rear view mirror (glued to the windshield rather than bolted to the top of the cab), molded plastic door panels, and elongated window cranks. It’s the little things, y’know?</p>
