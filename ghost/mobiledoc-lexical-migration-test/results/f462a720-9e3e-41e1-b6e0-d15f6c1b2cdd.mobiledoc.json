After getting 2,000 people to respond, the company thinks it’s zeroed in on what consumers lust after. We think the results are interesting, to say the least."

It spoke with an expert from Edmunds, who said Elon Musk has “converted faithful masses to his gospel.” This expert also thought it was appropriate the Mustang was at the top of the wish list since it’s so traditionally American. Maybe we’re the only ones who think a “dream car” should be something more ludicrous than a Mustang?"
