<p>For car lovers, Hollywood always find a way to draw us in a little deeper with unique vehicles acting as the perfect co-stars. Icons include <em>Bullitt</em>, <em>Vanishing Point</em> and <em>American Graffiti</em>, but who could forget the Porsche 928 from <em>Risky Business</em>, the Buick Roadmaster from <em>Rain Man</em> or the Chevy Camaro Z28 from <em>Fast Times At Ridgemont High</em>?</p>
<p>Science fiction movies and television shows help take automobiles to new heights, and to celebrate cars that we've come to love from the sci-fi genre, the Petersen Automotive Museum introduced its "<strong>Hollywood Dream Machines: Vehicles of Science Fiction and Fantasy</strong>" exhibit earlier this year. If you haven't had a chance to check it out yet, there's good news: this exhibit has been extended until May 2020.</p>

<p>The exhibit displays more than 50 cars from over 40 sci-fi films making it the largest museum exhibition of sci-fi vehicles in the world. These vehicles span everything from popular movies and shows like <em>Back To The Future</em>, <em>Iron Man</em> and the James Bond movies to cult classics like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>. Batman lovers will appreciate this display as it features classic cars like the 1966 Batmobile and Jokermobile (both designed by George Barris), the Michael Keaton-era Batmobile and the Batpod motorcycle from the Christian Bale Batman movies.</p>
<p>One of the coolest cars on display is the 2016 Audi R8 shown above, which was featured in <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> and <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. Looking like the Iron Man suit, this Audi appears in an "exploded view" showing a finer detail of the car's rear-mounted V10 engine. There are a handful of other production cars like the Lexus LC500 from <em>Black Panther</em> and Ford Taurus from the 2014 <em>RoboCop</em> remake, but most are from a designer's imagination like the Audi RSQ from <em>I, Robot</em>, 2054 Lexus Coupe from <em>Minority Report</em> and, of course, the Tron Light Cycle. Â In addition to the Hollywood vehicles, this exhibit also features artwork, props and costumes used in sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>Hollywood Dream Machines opened May 5, 2019 and it was originally set to end March 15, 2020, but now it has been extended by a couple of months.</p>
