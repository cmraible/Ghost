<p>The RGA is chaired by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), <a href="https://www.kold.com/2022/09/16/arizona-has-bused-nearly-2000-migrants-border/">who has sent</a> thousands of migrants from his state on buses to Washington D.C. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) recently generated headlines for luring migrants in Texas onto planes with the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/20/texas-migrants-massachusetts-lawsuit-ron-desantis/">promise of work and shelter</a> and sending them to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/us/desantis-florida-migrants-marthas-vineyard.html">Martha‚Äôs Vineyard</a>. A similar plan to send migrants to Delaware, Biden‚Äôs home state, was <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article266089771.html">canceled</a> after the Florida press found out about it.</p>
<p>Major brand-name corporate donors to the RGA include: oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron; health insurers UnitedHealth Group, Centene Corp., and Elevance (Anthem); pharmacy giant CVS Health, which owns health insurer Aetna; and drugmaker Pfizer and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the powerful drug lobby known as PhRMA.</p>
<p>Other big donors include Coca-Cola, Koch Industries, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, tobacco giant Altria, and private prison companies GEO Group and CoreCivic.</p>
<p>In the 2020 election cycle, Facebook donated $116,000 to the RGA, according to data from Political MoneyLine.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/313752069181919?id=288762101909005">says</a> that advertisers are expected to comply with Facebook‚Äôs community standards, which <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/facebook-community-standards">declare</a>: ‚ÄúWe believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others.‚Äù</p>
<p>The company‚Äôs community standards additionally <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/coordinating-harm-publicizing-crime/">say</a>: ‚ÄúIn an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm and copycat behavior, we prohibit people from facilitating, organizing, promoting, or admitting to certain criminal or harmful activities targeted at people, businesses, property, or animals.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ads targeting migrants launched last week amid escalating scrutiny of DeSantis‚Äô migrant bus stunts, but so far Facebook has not taken them down.</p>
