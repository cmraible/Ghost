While two of the cars were able to get away, police arrested a 14-year-old and 15-year-old, the latter having been arrested several other times for similar stunts."

Police have been cracking down not only on street racing and car theft but also the illegal use of dirt bikes on public roads, drug trafficking, and illegal weapons possession. Often, car theft helps finance other illegal activities, so we’re not shocked."
