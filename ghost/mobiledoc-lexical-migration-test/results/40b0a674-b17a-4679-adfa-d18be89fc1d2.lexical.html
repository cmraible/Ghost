<p>Welcome to TechieBytes episode 86 titled <em>Building the OS for the future of work (feat. Adam Nathan)</em></p>
<p>Today I'm speaking with <a href="https://twitter.com/adampnathan" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">Adam Nathan</a>, CEO at <a href="https://almanac.io/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">Almanac</a>, a startup that's building the asyncOS for the future of work. We discuss what the future of work looks like, what to look for in an investor, how he thinks about pricing his product, and what Adam's thoughts are on the Miami tech scene. Enjoy!</p>
