<p><a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1990-porsche-911-carrera-2-backdate/">In 1990</a>, there was one company that led the charge toward the future of performance amid increasing environmental regulations. That brand was Porsche, a German company known for making sports cars. Indeed, the 911 lineup was probably one of the last good options anybody had in the early 1990s. It makes sense that models <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1990-porsche-911-carrera-2-backdate/">like this Carrera</a> are so popular. Although, this isn’t any ordinary Porsche.</p>

<p>The stunning looks recall the 911 RSR.   This restoration features attention to detail and accentuates its angular body lines. The tires and integrated sidelines reach out for a past where the stock fenders were and wider wheels and tires allow for better traction and handling capabilities. That’s definitely necessary when you have a car enthusiast behind the wheel and hungry for speed. Of course, good looks were not the only great selling points of these cars.</p>

<p>You can’t argue with the incredibly low-riding suspension which gives the car amazing on-track performance. That control is even further backed up by the five-speed manual transmission and punctuated with a 3.6-liter flat-six engine. All of these things combine to make what some call the perfect sports car.  This 911's upgrades bring it to a whole new level. At the end of the day what matters is if you can see yourself behind the wheel, really ask yourself this one. Are you ready for this car? Bid now!</p>
