After all, the average car payment has surged past $700 a month and a record percentage of car shoppers are carrying monthly payments of $1,000 or more. With the economy sputtering out, something has to give in this scenario. We’re starting to see the first sign of cracks in the dam as repossessions skyrocket.",

Those companies are preparing for a rough, long recession where they will be incredibly busy.

He also added that repossessions among prime borrowers have roughly doubled, indicating all the talk of higher-income households being more insulated from this downturn is likely not aligned with the coming reality. Anyone who wants to say the auto industry and lenders aren’t in serious trouble is in a state of denial.
