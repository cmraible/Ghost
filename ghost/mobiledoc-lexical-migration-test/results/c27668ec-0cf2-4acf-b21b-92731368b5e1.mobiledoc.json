This 1968 Chevrolet Corvette L88 Convertible underwent a recent restoration by Corvette expert David Walters, and it  maintained the car's original color combination of the British Green paint with color-matched hard top and Saddle tan leather interior. The Corvette has all the receipts from this restoration as well as ownership history, which can be traced back all the way to when it was purchased new from Harte Chevrolet in Meridian, Connecticut."

Other L88 engine upgrades included the 850 CFM Holley four-barrel carburetor, aluminum heads, 12.5:1 compression, and to show its racing intentions, the radiator fan, heater and radio were factory deleted."
