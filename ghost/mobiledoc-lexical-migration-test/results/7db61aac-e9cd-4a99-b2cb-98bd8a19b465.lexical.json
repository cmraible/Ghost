In 1988, the car was sold with a reported 50k-miles showing to Christopher Joel of Surrey, England for £10,000. A complete restoration was done by Ferrari specialist Kevin O'Rourke of Moto Technique Ltd of Surrey and the car was converted to right-hand-drive and fitted with a new speedometer showing 0-miles.
