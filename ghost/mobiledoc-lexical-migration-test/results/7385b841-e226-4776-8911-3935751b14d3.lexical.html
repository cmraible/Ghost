<hr>
<p>Edsel Ford II made waves when he put <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/two-edsel-ford-ii-wagons/">two of his classic wagons</a> into the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barrett-jackson-scottsdale-fall/">Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction</a> for this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/barrett-jackson-pushes-january-auction-back/">past weekend</a>, and the move paid off big time. Both wagons exceeded expectations, one even setting a new record, proving once again that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">provenance</a> absolutely affects market value for collectible cars.</p>

<p>Quite a few collectors wanted to get their hands on the two wagons owned by Henry Ford’s great-grandson. This resulted in the 1958 Edsel Bermuda Wagon selling for $165,000. With a brown exterior and tan interior, it certainly presents nicely. With that price, this wagon also sets a record for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/dont-believe-hype-1959-edsel-villager/">Edsels</a>, showing that what was once a despised joke in the history of Ford has now become sought after.</p>

<p>Not only was the Edsel Bermuda famous for being owned by Edsel Ford II, it has some nice additions to make it more enjoyable to take on a cruise. It packs a nice, potent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/go-on-a-virtual-tour-of-the-roush-garage/">Roush</a>V8. The frame and floor pan were reworked in 2016 while seatbelts, carpeting, seals, and heat shielding were replaced recently for a much more comfortable ride quality.</p>
<p>As for the 1947 Ford Super Deluxe Custom Woody, it did even better on the auction block, selling for $209,000. Also modified by Roush, it packs a modern-style 302ci V8 with a custom 2.25-inch ceramic-coated exhaust, plus a Ford 9-inch rear with 3.75:1 gears. Many other modern upgrades have also been added, namely an automatic transmission, power steering, and 4-wheel power disc brakes.</p>
<p>Both cars reportedly generated so much attention, bids both online and over the phone were pouring in from around the world. Offered at no reserve, they generated considerable interest before crossing the auction block on Saturday night.</p>
