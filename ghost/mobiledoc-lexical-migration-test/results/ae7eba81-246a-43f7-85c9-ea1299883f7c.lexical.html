<p>British automaker <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Rolls-Royce">Rolls-Royce</a> has decided to turn the clock back to the roaring twenties for its first Collection Car of this new decade. The Dawn Silver Bullet Collection is an ultra-luxurious roadster which absolutely oozes retro coolness. For now, we’re seeing just abstract renderings of the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a>, but what Rolls-Royce is showing off looks quite compelling.</p>

<p>According to the company, the overall message of the Dawn Silver Bullet is one of frivolity and decadence. It’s supposed to be a callback to the glamorous days of Hollywood before the Great Depression and the opulent cars driven by the most famous stars.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that this model is being called the Silver Bullet, besides a hat tip to the new ultra-metallic silver Bespoke paint. After all, silver has been used throughout Rolls-Royce history, including for the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Rolls-Royce/Silver%20Wraith">Silver Wraith</a>, Silver Spectre, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Rolls-Royce/Silver%20Shadow">Silver Shadow</a>, Silver Dawn, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Rolls-Royce/Silver%20Cloud%20III">Silver Cloud</a>, Silver Silence, and Silver King.</p>
<p>Bold, carefree non-conformity is supposed to be communicated with the flowing lines. If the renderings are any indication, this version of the Rolls-Royce Dawn will feature more swooping exterior lines, like its car designs of a century ago. It’s not like anyone drives a Rolls to blend in, but this model has the potential to really stand out, even among other high-end cars.</p>

<p>We can see several interesting details in the released renderings. Contrasting with the silver paint are dark highlights, including around the headlights and front bumper finisher. Rolls-Royce will use part-polished wheels with a unique translucent shadow finish plus a silver pinstripe, which no doubt will be mesmerizing whether the car is sitting or rolling down the road. There’s also a vapor-blasted titanium finish for the Aero Cowling windbreak show in great detail. The Silver Bullet name will be in a contrast machined text, so it stands out in a big way.</p>
<p>At a time when some automakers are getting away from tactile elements for car interiors, it’s refreshing to hear Rolls-Royce is putting that quality front-and-center for the Dawn Silver Bullet. For example, there is carbon fiber but it’s an open-pore variety, so you get a dash of new material with some texture to it. Quilted leather with contrast stitching is also confirmed, while real wood could possibly be available, although the open-pore carbon fiber might displace it.</p>

<p>You can rest assured the Rolls-Royce Dawn Silver Bullet Collection cars will be highly coveted by collectors in the coming years. The automaker is looking to drum up more interest in them through a variety of marketing efforts, including holding Silver Bullet Drives or exclusive road trips for owners.</p>
