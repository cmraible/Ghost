Perhaps there is some arguing over if it was this car it was the 1964 GTO, but the truth remains, the rocket is a legend no less. Recently, a 1957 rocket was found after sitting for around 30 years, with absolutely no end in sight. The new owners had one simple question, would it run?"

As is the case with a lot of classic cars that end up like that, it seems like this vehicle just needed some work done and the owner never really got to it, probably due to old age. Nevertheless, this was a 1957 rocket 88 which came with some pretty cool options including air conditioning, a 371 in.³ V8, and a pretty good looking interior."

Well, it was less running and more walking but you get the point. As the 1957 luxury muscle car made its way around the field, you can hear some pretty loud knocking and have a good laugh at the body panels nearly shaking off with every bump. Nevertheless, the vehicle is back in working condition which means something very hopeful, perhaps a restoration is in order."
