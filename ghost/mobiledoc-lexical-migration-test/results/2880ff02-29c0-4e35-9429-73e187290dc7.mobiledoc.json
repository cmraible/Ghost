According to a recent report, FBHVC has been talking to the UK Department of Transport about some proposed new driving laws it claims could negatively impact vehicle owners."

Of course, these laws are meant to keep the citizens of the UK safe, a reason which is cited for all kinds of government actions these days. They’re also supposed to safeguard the climate since decreasing carbon emissions is like turning down the global thermostat, or some such nonsense."
