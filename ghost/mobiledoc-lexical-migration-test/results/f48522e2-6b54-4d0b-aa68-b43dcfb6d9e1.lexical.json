This has been niggling me since the service upped the default width to wider than the column size of this blog. I had to manually work out the height and width and modify the embed code, which was a complete pain.\n\nSimple addition, but it’ll make life so much easier.\n\n[ ](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2010/07/image_2.png)\n\n\n"
