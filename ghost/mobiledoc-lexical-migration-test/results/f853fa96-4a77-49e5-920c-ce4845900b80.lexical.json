While it's unclear who exactly put these cars underwater. We know that the story revolves around nine stolen vehicles likely stashed in the area years earlier. While it may be possible to find evidence of the vehicles' origins or possibly who put them there, the primary concern was to preserve the water and surrounding wildlife. After years of residents talking with authorities, conservationists, and water companies alike, the waters have finally been drained, and the cars have been dug out of their seemingly perpetual residence.",

Residents will no longer have to see the up-ended tailpipes of these nine vehicles when the water levels are low, making the area an even more beautiful landscape. Hopefully, the same planning, precision, and technology will be used to free up other places with a similar issue and make the world a cleaner place for water-going citizens. ",
