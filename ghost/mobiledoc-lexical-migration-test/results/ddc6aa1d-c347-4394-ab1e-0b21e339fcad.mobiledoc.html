<p>A reminder that <strong>today at 4pm ET (1pm PT)</strong> we will be hosting our weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a>. Due to the addition of several important guests, we have slightly refocused the subject for the event. David will be discussing the Supreme Court’s latest ethics scandals with Justin Elliot from <em>ProPublica</em> and Michael Liroff from the <em>5-4 Pod</em>, including those uncovered in Justin’s newest blockbuster series on Clarence Thomas and conservative billionaire Harlan Crow. They’ll also be taking questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lever Live </strong></em><strong>is publicly available for anyone to listen to and participate in. Just click the button below to find the show on Callin at 4pm ET.</strong></p>
