          "Maybe it was because of the success of the Camaro in the Neiman Marcus catalog, or maybe it was partly out of keeping the rivalry up, but Ford was able to convince the department store to sell an exclusive version of the 2015 Mustang GT Convertible. With a two-tone blue and silver paint job and 700-horsepower on tap, plus a production run of only 100 cars, these topless ponies retailed for $95,000 each."

          "One of the big names in ultra-luxury lifestyle is Rolls-Royce so it was zero shock when a special edition of the 2017 Dawn convertible appeared in the Neiman Marcus catalog. You could get the car in either orange or blue, but to say you ordered yours through the department store meant paying an extra $100,000."
