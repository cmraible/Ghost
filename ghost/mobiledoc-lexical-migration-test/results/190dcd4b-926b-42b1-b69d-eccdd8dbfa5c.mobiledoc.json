These modern Mopars have more sophisticated, electronic ignitions they have to get around. To do that, they’re carrying tablets and extra keys, which they program to the vehicle on the spot. Such devices aren’t exactly cheap, so someone is providing the hardware to the thieves and teaching them how to use it."
