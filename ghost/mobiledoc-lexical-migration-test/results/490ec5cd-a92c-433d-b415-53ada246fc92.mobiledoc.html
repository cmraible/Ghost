<p>Everyone loves a good <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/look-on-in-horror-at-these-12-valuable-barn-find-cars/">barn find</a>, even if it is more of a field find. The problem with either of these though is that when it comes time to try and get the car back on the road, the issues can sometimes seem endless. Although some cars are just too enticing regardless of their current condition and one of those cars that is near impossible to refuse is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-1970-challenger/">1970 Dodge Challenger</a>. While the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-hemi-cars/">HEMI powered </a>Challenger will always be one of the most desirable of its kind, it is also rare to find a complete 318 car as many of these cars were stripped down for parts to keep the HEMI cars on the road.</p>
<p>As seen in a recent YouTube video looking back on a few past Roadkill Garage builds, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-dodge-challenger-r-t/">1970 Dodge Challenger</a> was a good find. The car was last registered in 1989 and it has been sitting pretty much untouched since then. At first glance, it may seem like there are not many usable parts on the car. Although this initial assessment is relatively true, with a little bit of ingenuity and a donor running gear from a truck, it is still possible to breathe new life into this forgotten Challenger.</p>

<p>Rust and wildlife make disassembly and reassembly a lot more difficult. However, after a few days of work, the classic muscle car is out of the field and back to where it was always intended to be. Screaming down the open road.</p>
<p>The open road is not the only terrain where a Challenger can excel though. Later in the video, another 1970 Challenger gets a much-needed suspension upgrade from its days as a circle dirt track car. The modifications afford the Challenger an extra 3-inches of ground clearance and better off-road grip, making it a very unique, go-anywhere machine.</p>
