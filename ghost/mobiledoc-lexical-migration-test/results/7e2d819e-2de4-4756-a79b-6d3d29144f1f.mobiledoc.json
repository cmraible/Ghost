The thing shoots flames like a flamethrower and sounds extra aggressive, making it more muscle car than dead body hauler, which is hellishly perfect. This is how all hearses should be to make funerals far more exciting."

What you hear in the included video is a custom straight pipe exhaust system, and my does it not churn out some beautiful music!"

Thankfully, these guys go with a proven method of embedding spark plugs in the exhaust system and tuning this ride to run rich, so there’s plenty of fuel in those exhaust gases to burn for those extra-big flames. Next, we want to see them start a campfire or roast some marshmallows with this thing."

We just hope they’ve given this hearse the TLC it deserves, because it would be a shame if such a ride were to fall into complete ruin. It sounds like they have plans to use it for hauling go-karts and supplies, but they might be able to rent it out for gearheads’ funerals. After all, who wouldn’t want their final ride to be in a flame-shooting hearse?"
