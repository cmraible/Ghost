Also in the car was a 35-year-old woman and four teenage girls, ages 17, 16, 15, and 14. The crash was so violent it sent debris spraying hundreds of feet and left patrons at a nearby restaurant shaken."

The muscle car skidded across the intersection into the oncoming traffic lanes, hitting a traffic control box, then spinning down the sidewalk before it came to a rest."

Authorities didn’t release any details about the victims’ conditions, only saying two were in such bad condition they had to be airlifted to the hospital. Meanwhile, any charges connected to the crash are pending an investigation."

Other horrific, often fatal accidents have resulted in this kind of ill-advised behavior. There’s a reason why vehicles are designed to carry only a certain quantity of passengers, so exceeding that is to take a tremendous risk."
