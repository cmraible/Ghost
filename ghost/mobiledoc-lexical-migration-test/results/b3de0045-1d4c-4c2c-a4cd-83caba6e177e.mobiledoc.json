While it might at first seem like just another dumb kids’ cartoon, the film is packed with smart gearhead jokes we’re pretty sure most people don’t fully understand or even notice, at least not all of them. To honor the legacy of the hit movie, Porsche has worked with Pixar to create a one-off 911 Sally Special to be auctioned during Monterey Car Week."
