<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11485">The Torino</a> started off as an option for Ford’s Fairlane model. From the very beginning, the car was available with any number of engine options, several transmission options, and nearly all body styles. Although the model drew most of its attention from the average car buyer looking for a good family car, many of the available options insinuated that there was more to<a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11485"> the Torino</a> than what meets the eye. </p>

<p>With independent studies from the time and much later agreeing, it is clear that <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11485">the Torino</a> was intended to be one of Ford’s top competitors in the muscle car era and when so adequately equipped it was an absolute force to be reckoned with no matter the direction of the road or the shape of the driver's preferred track.</p>
