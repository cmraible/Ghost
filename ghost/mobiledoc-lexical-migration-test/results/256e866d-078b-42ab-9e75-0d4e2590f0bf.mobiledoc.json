In a simple case of being in the right place at the right time, Ryan with Iowa Classic Cars stumbled on one of the largest Impala barn finds we’ve ever seen. In total he recovered five cars and among the haul were three 1959 "

After getting some more Impala parts from someone named Paul in June of 2020, Brad informed Ryan that Paul may be interested in parting with some 1959 Impalas. It turns out that Paul had acquired five cars from junkyards in the 1970’s and 1980’s, and being in his 80s now, he was looking to sell all of his cars."
