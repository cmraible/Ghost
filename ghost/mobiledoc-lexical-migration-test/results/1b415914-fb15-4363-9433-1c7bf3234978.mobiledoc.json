Well, some crazy Russians decided to make it more interesting by washing their Chevy Camaro while it’s driving around on a race track. Of course that’s not practical, but they did this for content, so don’t ask too many questions. Instead, enjoy the entertainment factor and try not to think too much."

Also, they put a washer and a generator inside the van. Yes, this is completely nuts and unnecessary, but what else do you expect from Russians?"

While that’s not super fast, it’s also not sitting still, which is how you usually wash a car. Can they accurate shoot the soap all over it? How are they going to scrub all that dirt off the American muscle car? There are so many questions but all will be answered by watching the video."
