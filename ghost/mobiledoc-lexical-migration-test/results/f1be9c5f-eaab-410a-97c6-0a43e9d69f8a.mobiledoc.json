He special ordered it with Graphite Gray paint and a Blue plaid interior for a look which is unique and admittedly quite handsome. A recent cosmetic refresh leaves everything look absolutely spectacular, including almost flawless chrome as well as a leather suitcase set fitted to the rear cargo area."

The man held onto it until 2005."
