After all, it refuses to help tuners hack the C8 Corvette and along with several automakers like Ford tried using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to keep private individuals from working on their privately-owned car back in 2015. Now, the forces that be in the company reportedly want to stop users from transferring the factory warranty on certain high-performance models."
