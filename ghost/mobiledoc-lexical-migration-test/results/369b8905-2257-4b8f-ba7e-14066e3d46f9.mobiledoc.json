However, it was increasingly difficult for younger enthusiasts to get their hands on a muscle or sports car due to inflating value and hype. Until Ford hit the performance car market with a new type of vehicle, which shook consumers in all the right ways. Deemed the pony car, these cars combined the raw power and spacious comfort of a muscle car with a sports car's performance and lightweight design. Between the lines of performance and practicality is "

This vehicle was one of just 224 Rent-A-Racer cars ordered to give rental drivers the chance to go fast without breaking the bank. It sounds like a lot of fun to rent your own racing vehicle, but it makes sense that the program was only mildly successful.
