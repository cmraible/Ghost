In the process of him showing off what he learned while spending many hours playing Grand Theft Auto, he managed to rack up 31 separate charges, helping to guarantee he won’t be getting out of prison for a long time. These are the kind of dumb criminals we love to see in action."

That’s when 27-year old Kenneth Lunford, Jr. stole the other guy’s car and ran from the law."

Traversing through foliage, he probably thought he’d lost the cops, but the helicopter had a good fix on him. Then they guy jumps in a nearby waterway and tries to make a swim for it. Sadly, there was no boat docked there for him to steal, or the chase would’ve become even more interesting. Also, the guy swims like a two-year-old learning in the shallow end, using his arms to “walk” along the shallow bottom. If he wasn’t a good swimmer, why did he think going into the water was a good idea? Why do criminals do dumb things, then make them worse by running for it, racking up 31 charges? We wish we knew for sure."
