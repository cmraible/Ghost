Each one is in running and driving condition, with the majority having been put through frame-off restorations with beautiful results.

This wagon came with four-wheel drive at a time when such technology was rare, with Marmon and Harrington being true pioneers. A beautiful restoration has left the wood looking gorgeous outside and in, while the interior features supple leather and a plethora of original details."

The panels on this car are made of maple, birch, and basswood, making for quite the dramatic presentation. A frame-off restoration has left no detail unaddressed, so this classic is ready to show off to the most scrutinizing of critics."
