<p>It’s nearly the weekend. And we know what this weekend brings, don’t we?</p>
<p>Eurovision.</p>
<p>Now, we might be lacking Terry Wogan this year, so can I recommend a whole different kind of coverage for you? Mr Ewan Spence, a mad Scotsman whom I’ve run around New York and Paris with (but never anywhere in the UK, strangely), is over in Moscow reporting on the thing, in an online, new-media kind of way. In fact, he’s been doing so all week, so you can head over to his site to get your preparation done for <a href="http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/category/conferences/2009/eurovision-2009/">tomorrow night’s Eurovision extravaganza</a>.</p>
<p>And just to whet your appetite, here’s his 50 Fun Facts about the Eurovision:</p>

Around an event like the Eurovision, the main broadcast is in real danger of becoming just a social object that people interact about elsewhere. <br>
