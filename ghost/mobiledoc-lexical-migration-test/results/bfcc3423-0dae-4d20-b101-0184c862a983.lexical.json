In the process, it’s angering some customers, but perhaps it’s like the old saying about how you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet.",

That’s an odd observation since the entire automotive industry has been negatively impacted by that, so why is Tesla any different? The publication argues that answer lies in the fact Tesla has been valued on Wall Street in similar fashion to tech stocks. In other words, the shocking reality is Tesla might not be the most valuable automaker in the entire world, something many industry insiders already knew, which was why claims by financial gurus, media outlets, etc. that Tesla was the future of cars elicited laughs, eye rolls, etc.",
