Instead, the auto giant issued a press release casting its efforts as nothing short of heroic. Called the “Environmental, Social and Governance Partnership Pledge” the company claims suppliers representing over half of the $76 billion direct material annual purchase value it made in 2021 have signed on."

          "Now, that last sentence is worded awkwardly because that’s how GM put it in the press release. That kind of verbal dancing was most likely carefully crafted to get you to focus on the over half part about suppliers. The real story is in what it doesn’t say: what percentage of its total suppliers have signed the ESG pledge. If it was an impressive figure, GM would be trotting that out with pride. The fact is ESG is quickly gaining a bad reputation with those who have done some real research about what it actually entails and how it relates to The Great Reset, instead of just reading some slick press releases or praise-filled articles on the topic."
