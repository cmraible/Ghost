          ", Adam Maqboul hosts a virtual meetup with owner, David Handy, to chat about his 2018 Chevy Silverado LTZ with a 6.2L crew cab short box. With regular 48-hour road trips from Texas to Canada, David’s Silverado was built with performance in mind. His truck needed to be capable of safely getting him to and from the hunting site while still being able to carry him around the city. For the sake of versatility he relied on a lot of tasteful choices."

          "David took his off-road package a little further by adding a black grille guard, LED light bar, fender flares, and mud flaps. As a big fan of Weathertech products, David’s build features the roll-up tonneau cover, front and rear floor liners, and tech shades on every window. For use as a daily driver, on hunting excursions, and long road trips, each part was carefully chosen to serve a purpose and these parts add utility and value while protecting and preserving David's truck. With 45,000 miles on his rig, David has plans to install a lift kit followed by a new set of Silverado wheels and tires. For additional photos and product specs, viewers are invited to check out the dedicated build page for David’s 2018 Silverado LTZ "
