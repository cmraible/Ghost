          "There isn’t much to focus on in terms of gameplay. The games are visual novels, so players will become fast friends with the A button. I’m sure the game is emulating the original experience in this regard but often the player will need to hit the same selection in a menu more than once to find out more information. Some examples: sometimes you need to hit option A thrice to get all the information. Sometimes you would need to hit option A, then option B, then option A. Sometimes you would need to hit option A, then option C in a different menu, then the original option A. My complaint with this is that the game does nothing to indicate that any option may yield more results. Options don’t gray out when they’ve been depleted of information, so there will be times when you’ve hit every option but the game isn’t progressing, making the only solution to finding out what to do is going through every menu, hitting every option until you hit the one that gives you something more. Sometimes, the order in which you need to hit the options is esoteric, making progressing somewhat infuriating. Normally, I would chalk this up to the fact that this game is 32 years old, but this is a remake. I won’t overlook the exclusion of basic quality of life features like graying out an option you don’t need anymore."

The main character is suffering from amnesia, and strives to discover who they are and what happened to them. Soon they find their close friend, Ayumi Tachibana, who informs the protagonist that he is a part of the Utsugi Detective Agency, a private investigator group, and that he was in the middle of a case. The protagonist then follows the steps he took and soon becomes reacquainted with the case he took for a client named Zenzou. Zenzou is a butler for the rich Ayashiro family and he had hired the protagonist to look into the mysterious death of Kiku Ayashiro, the matriarch of the family who had passed away the night she had gathered her extended family to read her will. Official reports state that she had died due to a pre-existing heart condition but Zenzou did not trust that answer and hired the protagonist to investigate. Rumors of a curse on the Ayashiro family are circulating throughout the small village and people claim that Kiku will rise from the grave and take revenge on the living. A panic arises when a second member of the Ayashiro family is murdered and what was once a suspicious passing becomes a murder investiagtion. "

Initially thought to be a mistake, the protagonist is able to deduce that the girl had been murdered due to strangulation marks on her neck. What follows is an investigation into the high school that the victim had attended, which brings to light how closely the case is tied to an old ghost story revolving around a poltergeist the students call The Girl Who Stands Behind.

Camera angles are much more visually appealing; one that really stood out to me is a shot where Ayumi and the protagonist are talking in front of a mirror and the protagonist’s reflection can be seen off center in the mirror.

There are definitely flaws in the games that do not need to be there considering they are remakes but they don’t tear it down. It’ll cater to more patient players but I would assume that would be the general audience of visual novels anyway. The most egregious issue I have is the fact that I think the titles are misleading, so those who are buying them as a gift should check the maturity rating and consider who you’re giving it to. Other than that, I only have minor nitpicks to say, like how the protagonist runs around telling people he’s a detective when he’s really a private investigator with no ties to the police or how The Girl Who Stands Behind is possibly the least intimidating name for a ghost."
