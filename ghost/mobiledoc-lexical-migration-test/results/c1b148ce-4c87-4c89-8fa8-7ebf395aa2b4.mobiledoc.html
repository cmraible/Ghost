<p>This is Lever Weekly, a recap of our work from the past week. If you only read one email from us all week, this should be it.</p>
<p>Below you will find a breakdown of our reporting, podcasts, videos, and live events ‚Äî a feature open to all subscribers. Following that, we are providing paid subscribers with an original column, written by a member of <em>The Lever</em>, connecting the dots on our coverage to deliver important takeaways.</p>
<p>In this week‚Äôs column, exclusively for paid subscribers, David Sirota explores how, in a rare turn of events, it looks like politicians may actually try to protect people from more dangerous derailments like the Norfolk Southern accident in Ohio.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-how-it%E2%80%99s-supposed-to-work">This Is How It‚Äôs Supposed To Work</h3>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/david-sirota/">David Sirota</a></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpdxEMelR0">Schoolhouse Rock</a> version of America, the press raises awareness about a problem, informed voters pressure both parties‚Äô lawmakers, who then say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, there oughta be a law‚Äù ‚Äî and then the legislative process proceeds.</p>
<p>This is how America‚Äôs political process is actually supposed to function, but <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-democracy-crisis-that-is-never-discussed/">almost never does</a> in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcb4_QwP6fE">wretched hive of scum and villainy</a> that is modern Washington. And yet in a rare turn of events, the process seems to be working right now, which (to borrow a Bidenism) is a big f-ing deal.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>In the weeks since the East Palestine train derailment, <em>The Lever</em> has spotlighted the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/">governmental</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/there-will-be-more-derailments/">decisions</a> that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/where-is-buttigieg-on-the-bomb-train-threat/">deregulated</a> the nation‚Äôs rail system. That reporting shamed the national press into <a href="https://twitter.com/LeverNews/status/1627066088356974592?s=20">echoing our coverage</a> ‚Äî which was soon <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-following-disastrous-train-derailment-east-palestine-khanna-deluzio?ref=the-lever">credited</a> by lawmakers for raising public awareness of some of the biggest rail safety loopholes that were baked into America‚Äôs laws by corporate lobbyists and captured regulators.</p>
<p>Now, that reporting and subsequent public pressure has prompted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/ohio-toxic-trail-derailment-east-palestine-congress-derail-act">lawmakers</a> from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/politics/congress-response-railway-safety-norfolk-southern/index.html#:~:text=The%20bill%20includes%20a%20number,officials%20about%20what%20their%20trains">both parties</a> to spearhead legislation to fix some of the problems. It has also spurred the Biden administration to move from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/there-will-be-more-derailments/">total silence</a>, to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pretends-hes-powerless-to-reduce-derailment-risks/">pass-the-buck political deflection</a>, to belated <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pressured-into-promising-to-do-his-job/">promises</a> to lead the campaign for reform.</p>
<p>Cynics might argue that some of the Biden officials and lawmakers participating in the legislative and regulatory push are motivated not by principle, but by a desire to avoid blame and damage their partisan opponents. That may be entirely true ‚Äî but that‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.</p>

<p>American democracy is predicated on the theory that different factions will engage in ruthless and messy competitions to show who is most responsive to voters‚Äô demands ‚Äî and that such competitions will ultimately produce positive results, regardless of the amorality and opportunism of the individual players.</p>
<p>This process is most often short circuited by political corruption and by a corporate media that shields rather than scrutinizes power ‚Äî both of which almost always <a href="https://act.represent.us/sign/problempoll-fba/">cut voters out of the game</a>.</p>
<p>But despite that corruption and despite the media‚Äôs best efforts to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-weekly-shadowbanning-an-inconvenient-truth/">shadowban important facts</a>, the short-circuiting isn‚Äôt (yet) happening. On the contrary: The process is actually working ‚Äî at least for now.</p>
<p>As always, the devil will be in the legislative and regulatory details ‚Äî and this coming week, <em>The Lever</em> will be providing our readers a critical look at those details, so that they can judge the merits of the legislation.</p>
<p>No doubt, it will take continued vigilance to pull the levers of power in the right direction, against the wishes of powerful lobbyists and the legislators they own. That pressure ‚Äî in the form of journalism and activism ‚Äî will be necessary to make sure rhetorical promises of better policy become loophole-free legislative text, and then become new laws that actually fix problems.</p>
<p>We will continue doing our part, just as we do on every issue we cover. Why? Because that is <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs core mission, which sets us apart from almost every other media outlet.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt accept the nihilistic notion that nothing can ever change, and that all efforts to pressure the political system are pointless, stupid and in vain.</p>
<p>We know full well that the system is deeply corrupt and dominated by powerbrokers with impure motives, but we also know the system is mutable ‚Äî if enough leverage is applied.</p>

<p>Similarly, we don‚Äôt do this work to entertain, amuse, or distract audiences, nor do we do it to comfort, placate, and reassure partisan audiences who never want to face inconvenient truths.</p>
<p>We do this work to inform, motivate, and empower our readers to force changes that improve the world.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening right now, thanks to our paying subscribers‚Äô support and activism. So let‚Äôs keep the pressure on.</p>
