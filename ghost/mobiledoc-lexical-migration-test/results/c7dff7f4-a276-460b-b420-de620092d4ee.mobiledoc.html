<p>Often touted as the perfect convertible, the <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/2004-ferrari-360-spider-6-speed-manual/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=4">Ferrari 360 Spider</a> featured a mid-mounted 3.6-liter quad-cam V8 engine that delivered 396 HP to the rear wheels.
