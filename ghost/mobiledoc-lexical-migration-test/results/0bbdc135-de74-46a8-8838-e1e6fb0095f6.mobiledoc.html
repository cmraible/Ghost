<p>One could argue all <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/guy-flog-ferrari-488-gtb-snow/">Ferraris</a> are special, and of course people are going to have opinions about that stance. However, pretty much everyone will agree a Ferrari 412 P race car isnâ€™t exactly your run-of-the-mill Prancing Horse. After all, the 56-year-old ride is quite rare at only four made and desirable among collectors. That makes Ferrari Classiche, the restoration and certification division in Maranello, announcing it restored one of these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-ferrari-gt/">classic beauties</a> a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Learn how Enzo Ferrari barely survived WWII <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/enzo-ferrari-barely-survived-wwii/">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Sharing images of the car on social media, we can see this ride in all its glory. Originally, the 412 P was designed as a stramge version of the P3 and P4. Ferrari created the customer car by taking the chassis from a 1966 P3 prototype and putting the body from a 1967 P4 on it. The combination is quite fantastic, and combined with the rarity factor adds a certain wow factor to the car.</p>
<p>As a feather in the cap of the Ferrari 412 P, one of the four earned a podium finish at the 1967 24 Hours of Daytona. In other words, these are more than just a pretty face, offering some pretty serious racing chops for those who want to take it to classic events.</p>

<p>However, getting near barriers or other cars in this pristine vehicle would be enough to make even the richest in the world sweat. After all, that bright yellow paint looks as flawless as possible, as do the light blue knock-off wheels, a combination few would consider on a modern ride.</p>
<p>The interior is similarly perfect, with red leather upholstery, something unexpected on most track toys. Everything from the switchgear to the gauges look correct and free from flaws.</p>
<p>However, the true beauty of this Ferrari is the 4.0-liter V12 with dual-injection valves and Weber carbs. To hear the song of that siren while shifting through the five-speed has to be pure heaven.</p>
