What it does have is a beautiful and understated shade of tan (an authentic 1940s color from Dodge) accented with a saddle-colored interior. The chopped cab, dropped stance and ultra-wide rear tires set this Dodge apart, but what really makes it a true one-off build is the 1937 Essex Terraplane nose that has been grafted onto the front end. Every inch of this Dodge shows the craftsmanship of its builder, and that is certainly the case with the engine compartment and those beautiful vintage valve covers."

This truck is powered by a 335 Hemi V8 circa 1955 that has been bored .030 over, and we can only imagine how hellacious the exhaust note is with the custom ceramic coated headers opened up; for a more muted engine noise, there's also cut-off for the Flowmaster mufflers. And since you're going to need a truck to get all of those show trophies home in, this Dodge even has a two-inch receiver hitch with a pair of trailer connecters."
