<p>I’ve been playing around with a few video upload sites, as I fancy doing a little more videoblogging, and want to acheive better quality than YouTube offers. A couple of sites have caught my eye, so I uploaded the same video clip to both to do a quick comparison.</p>
<p>This one is from <a href="http://blip.tv">blip.tv</a>, which has nice things like an automated video podcast feed and the option to upload different versions for different players:</p>
