<hr>
<p>Ford has a rich racing history surrounding <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-ford-gt-54/">its iconic GT40</a> that won "24 Hours of LeMans" four consecutive times from 1966-1969. Decades later, Ford unveiled a GT40 concept car at the Detroit Auto Show back in 2002, and it hyped up car enthusiasts for the possibility of a production mid-engine racecar. Shortly after, Ford released its plan to produce a different version of the GT40 concept car, and the first-gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/inside-john-cenas-muscle-car-collection/">Ford GT</a> was born. <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-ford-gt-54/">2,022 examples</a> of the 2005 Ford GT were built, and this one has only 1,000 miles on the clock.</p>

<p>Built as a performance powerhouse, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-ford-gt-54/">the 2005 Ford GT’</a>s heartbeat is supplied by 5.4-liter V8, topped with a twin-screw Eaton supercharger. With this setup, the car generates 550-horsepower and 500 lb/ft of torque and is shifted via a Ricardo 6-speed manual transmission. Functional rear scoops feed air into the hungry engine, and a helical limited-slip differential transfers the power to the ground. A stiff construction is necessary for a car of this caliber, so the car was given a lightweight aluminum space frame and body.</p>

<p>Dashing from 0-60 mph in just 3.3 seconds, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2005-ford-gt-54/">the Ford GT</a> was given a top speed at almost 200 miles per hour. With all of that power on tap, stopping power is just as important. Big Brembo four-piston aluminum brake calipers work in conjunction with cross-drilled and vented rotors do the job with ease. Alloy BBS wheels (18-inch front, 19-inch rear) wrapped with Goodyear Eagle F1 rubber sit on all four corners. While performance is the key ingredient, the GT also comes standard with a Macintosh sound system.</p>
