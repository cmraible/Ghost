While many people throw around the term \"no. 1\" condition a little too much these days, this condition rating – reserved for concours-quality vehicles – applies to NCRS Top Flight Corvettes. To receive such a rating, Corvettes are meticulously judged to rule out flaws, inaccuracies or counterfeits. NCRS has three award categories with the Top Flight representing the best of the best."

As expected from a Top Flight award winner, both the white paint job and red interior are flawless, and this color combination is a throwback to the original 1953 'Vette. Under the hood is the numbers-matching, 300-horsepower 327 CID V8 backed by the original two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission. This is a removable-hardtop-only Corvette as it was not equipped with the soft top."

If you're in the market for a classic C1 Corvette, you'd better act fast as these NCRS Top Flight winners don't pop up for sale very often. The current list price is $65,000, but you can click HERE to make an offer on this flawless, award-winning car."
