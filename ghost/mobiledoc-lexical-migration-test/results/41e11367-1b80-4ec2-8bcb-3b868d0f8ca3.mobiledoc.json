It’s understandable why more people are fighting back in the face of little help from law enforcement which is stretched thin after getting funding slashed as a fashion statement. One recent example of how one man was able to thwart thieves comes out of Toronto thanks to Apple AirTags."

Shockingly, the first time it happened in daylight right after he had television installers over. Lorne took precautions, putting his keys in a Faraday cage, but the thieves still were able to boost the luxury SUV. They also threw out his wallet and his kids’ phones, he believes in an attempt to thwart any attempt to track the vehicle."

While we don’t recommend putting them in such obvious places, the guy said he hid one in the glovebox, one in the spare wheel well, and one under the backseat."

Pushing the panic button on his key fob, he could hear his vehicle back in the complex. That’s when Lorne drove to the nearest police station. He was contacted the next day and told police recovered nine vehicles at the metal recycling center."

Hiding them in harder-to-access areas is a good idea as is using multiple trackers, like this guy did. You can’t just rely on the factory security features since good thieves are prepared to handle those. And whenever possible, park your vehicle in a secured garage."
