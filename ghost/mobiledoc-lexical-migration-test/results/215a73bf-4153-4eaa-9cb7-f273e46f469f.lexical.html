<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/automotive-industries-biggest-icons/">80</a>-year-old man would have been born in the 1941/1942 year range, so finding a 1941 Chevy Pickup truck in 2021 must have seemed like destiny. This started in early November, according to the Pennsylvania State Police Department at Dublin. According to the agency, “an unknown actor (who) falsely identified themselves as a white, non-Hispanic male, who was selling an antique motor vehicle online.”</p>
<p>The scammer instructed the elderly man to wire $23k as a payment for the 1941 Chevy pickup truck from Wells Fargo Bank to Citibank. Police noted that “the vehicle was never delivered and all accounts from the seller were deleted.”</p>
<p>According to the Federal Trade Commission, “Wiring money is like sending cash — once it’s gone, you probably can’t get it back.” Another agency noted “U.S. consumers lose millions of dollars each year to fraudsters using wire transfers as part of their scams.”</p>
