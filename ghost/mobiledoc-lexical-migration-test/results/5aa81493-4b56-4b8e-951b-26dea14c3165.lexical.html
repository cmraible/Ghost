<p>Good things are happening! A new Labor Department rule will expand the basic rights of gig workers. Also, an anti-abortion case with national ramifications was stopped in its tracks, unionized nurses in the Midwest are holding hospitals accountable, wind farms are proving to be a great return on investment, and Delaware is breaking cycles of debt with a bold new policy. </p>
<p>All this and much more in this week’s edition of <em>You Love To See It</em> below, a weekly feature reviewing good news, progress, and action steps that’s one of the many features available only to <em>Lever</em> supporting subscribers.</p>
<h3 id="biden-admin-moves-to-protect-gig-workers">Biden Admin Moves To Protect Gig Workers</h3>
<p>The Department of Labor announced a <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/biden-officials-propose-reclassifying-uber-lyft-gig-workers-as-employees/">new rule</a> that could help millions of gig workers, including drivers, janitors, and construction workers, by classifying them as employees rather than independent contractors. This reclassification could require companies to provide gig workers with the same benefits as employees: a minimum wage, overtime pay, and unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>“While independent contractors have an important role in our economy, we have seen in many cases that employers misclassify their employees as independent contractors, particularly among our nation’s most vulnerable workers,” Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh said in a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/WHD/WHD20221011-0">statement</a>. “Misclassification deprives workers of their federal labor protections, including their right to be paid their full, legally earned wages.”</p>
<p>After the proposed rule was announced, the stocks of Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash — companies that rely on exploitative gig arrangements — <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1579937941543321600?s=20&t=bK_22vFZco4UVJq7lWY8Jg">plummeted</a>. “There’s no better proof that gig companies’ business model is built on exploitation of workers,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1579937941543321600?s=20&t=bK_22vFZco4UVJq7lWY8Jg">tweeted</a> labor reporting group More Perfect Union.</p>
<p>Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, leader of the California Labor Federation, told the <em>New York Times</em> that the impacts of the new rule depend on how aggressively the Biden administration chooses to enforce it. Even so, the guidance will likely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/business/economy/biden-gig-workers-contractors-employees.html">shape</a> how judges and employers determine worker classification.</p>
<p>“Companies just continue to break labor law. They break it at the local level, the state level and federally, and there are no consequences. Everything is about enforcement,” said Fletcher.</p>
<h3 id="a-win-for-abortion-rights-activists">A Win For Abortion Rights Activists</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court refused to take up a Rhode Island legal case that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-anti-abortion-movements-next-supreme-court-case/">conservative anti-abortion activists</a> were hoping would pave the way for a federal abortion ban.</p>
<p>The petitioners wanted the high court to rule that fetuses are entitled to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. This ruling would have established “fetal personhood” and gone beyond the Supreme Court’s <em>Dobbs</em> ruling, which allowed states to ban abortion, by banning the procedure nationwide.</p>
<p>In declining the case, Rhode Island’s reproductive rights law <a href="https://www.riaclu.org/en/news/aclu-statement-ri-supreme-court-ruling-reproductive-privacy-act-lawsuit">remains in effect</a>.</p>
<h3 id="organized-nurses-just-won-a-groundbreaking-contract">Organized Nurses Just Won A Groundbreaking Contract</h3>
<p>Last week, the nurses union at the University of Michigan won a groundbreaking contract to address the harmful conditions created by austerity and corporate restructuring at Michigan Medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At the onset of the pandemic, Michigan Medicine medical center <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/10/michigan-university-nurses-union-contract-understaffing">laid off</a> 738 staff members following losses in revenue. After recuperating its losses and profiting by roughly $340 million by June 2021, Michigan Medicine did not rehire the workers, instead opting to expand staff responsibilities, mandate overtime hours, and create a management system in which workers reported experiencing moral trauma from the way burnout was reducing the quality of care for patients.</p>

<p>“They made millions on the backs of nurses working harder and harder, and nurses got to the point where we couldn’t do it anymore,” Renee Curtis, president of the Michigan Nurses Association-University of Michigan Professional Nurse Council, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/10/michigan-university-nurses-union-contract-understaffing">told</a><em>Jacobin</em>.</p>
<p>The nurses union’s new contract, which was secured after workers authorized a work stoppage, pushes back against <a href="__GHOST_URL__/hospitals-are-flouting-and-fighting-price-transparency-rules/">profit-gouging</a> corporate governance by providing enforceable staffing ratios, rolling back mandatory overtime, and holding management accountable to adequately staffing the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="offshore-wind-delivers-major-returns">Offshore Wind Delivers Major Returns</h3>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/offshore-wind-can-lower-energy-prices-and-beat-out-oil-and-gas/">report</a> by the progressive research institute <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a>, investing in offshore wind projects provides <a href="https://grist.org/energy/compared-to-oil-and-gas-offshore-wind-is-125-times-better-for-taxpayers/">125 times</a> better returns for taxpayers than offshore oil and gas investments. During lease sales — when public land is rented out — energy companies developing wind energy pay considerably more per acre, producing more energy at less cost, with stronger commitments to union labor, than their fossil fuel colleagues.</p>
<p>“Americans are getting significantly more return on investment from offshore wind energy lease sales than they are from oil and gas lease sales” per acre, Michael Freeman, author of the report, told <em>Grist</em>. “Expanding offshore wind energy is good for [taxpayers’] driving, for their wallet, for the air that they breathe.”</p>
<h3 id="delaware-breaks-the-debt-cycle">Delaware Breaks The Debt Cycle</h3>
<p>Last week, the Delaware state legislature signed into effect a <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=78879">bill that</a> will transform how the state imposes fees and fines that have long trapped people in debt.</p>
<p>The bill will <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2022/10/04/new-delaware-law-ends-many-fines-and-fees-that-criminalize-poverty/?sh=7595fae557b1">repeal</a> almost all fines and fees for minors in criminal cases, prohibit courts from charging interest or late fees, eliminate fees for public defenders, and track revenue generated from fines and fees to prevent vicious cycles of debt that criminalize poverty. Moreover, Delaware will no longer suspend drivers’ licenses for unpaid court debt, a punitive rule that has prevented thousands of residents from breaking free of debt.</p>

<p>“We applaud the state for passing this sweeping legislation,” said Institute for Justice Attorney Jaimie Cavanaugh in a <a href="https://ij.org/press-release/delaware-passes-landmark-law-ending-abusive-fines-and-fees/">statement</a>. “This bill recognizes that being poor is not a crime. It gives Delawareans a fair chance to pay down court debt without sacrificing everyday living expenses.”</p>

<h3 id="finally">Finally:</h3>
<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Adrienne Rich’s poem about listening, “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51092/what-kind-of-times-are-these">What Kind of Times Are These</a>”:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
<p>There’s a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill<br>and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows<br>near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted<br>who disappeared into those shadows.</p>
<p>I’ve walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don’t be fooled<br>this isn’t a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here,<br>our country moving closer to its own truth and dread,<br>its own ways of making people disappear.</p>
<p>I won’t tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods<br>meeting the unmarked strip of light—<br>ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise:<br>I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear.</p>
<p>And I won’t tell you where it is, so why do I tell you<br>anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these<br>to have you listen at all, it’s necessary<br>to talk about trees.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
