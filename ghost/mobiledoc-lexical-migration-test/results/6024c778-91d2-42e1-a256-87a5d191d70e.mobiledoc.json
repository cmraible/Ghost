This has been done by many others over the years, but to see corrosion eating through some of these legendary rides as well as the vegetation surrounding and even overgrowing them is somewhat surprising."

Even worse are the field find cars that have sat out in the elements for years or even decades. Those often become rust buckets barely worth saving, at best. That’s more like the situation in Fukushima."
