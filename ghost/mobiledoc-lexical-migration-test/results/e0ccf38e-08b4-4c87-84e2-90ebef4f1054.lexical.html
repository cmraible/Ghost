<h2 id="one-big-read-facebooks-tactical-bias">One Big Read: Facebook's tactical bias</h2>
<p>As the globe watches the USA anxiously â€” one of the few electoral events that genuinely impacts the rest of the world â€” this is a good read on how, in its attempt to stay "in" with the ruling party, Facebook intentionally manipulated the media landscape. </p>
<p>The reflex reaction I've seen from many people is that Something Must Be Done about Facebook. But I can't help feeling that this should be a rallying cry for us to do more to connect <em>directly</em> with audiences, without relying on such an untrustworthy intermediate:</p>

<h2 id="return-of-the-sub">Return of the Sub</h2>
<p>The journalism business will eventually regret the wholesale cull of subs it had indulged in over the last 15 years. When they bring both the normal sub-editing rigour AND some core digital skills, they can be an invaluable part of the newsroom â€” and create a quality differentiation for your site.</p>
<p>And some organisations are beginning to wake up to this fundamental truth: </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/telegraph-media-group-production-pa-return-in-house/">

    </a></figure>
<p>Talking of those digital skills, here's an interesting insight into how the sub role could evolve to harness new technology:</p>

<h2 id="new-approaches-to-journalism">New approaches to journalism</h2>
<p>I probably need to write a deeper piece on this, but one of the disappointments of the digital transition is that, to a very large extent, we're still putting old wine in new bottles. The story formats we use today don't look fundamentally different from those of 25 years ago.</p>
<p>One of the deep problems with our formats becoming so formulaic is that those formulas are easy to copy, and misinformation and propaganda sites can appropriate the veneer of respectability that's imbued in the format.</p>
<p>We really need to shake up <em>how</em> we tell our stories, and I've come across a couple of interesting examples recently. The recent <a href="https://www.hackshackersldn.co.uk">Hacks/Hackers London</a> session on <em>Quartz's</em> climate change journalism is absolutely worth your time: </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-bdDDgOFHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p>And here's the project that they're talking about:</p>

<p>Ah, newsletters. The overnight success story that took two decadesâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>They remain a critical tool in building direct relationships with readers, without mediation via Facebook and Google. But they're also increasingly becoming a business in their own right. </p>
<p>This piece from Mark at newsletter platform Revue is a useful dive into the economics of newsletters:</p>

<p>Meanwhile current newsletter platform darling Substack continues to build out its technology. One big barrier to adoption has been the fact that you couldn't use your own domain name with the service. That's risky, because it makes it harder for you to migrate off it if needed in future. </p>
<p>Well, they've changed that â€” but they want $50 to do it. My guess as to the reason for that relatively high price is that setting up DNS to redirect domain names is tricky and technical. They want to discourage casual users from doing it, because of the potential support overheads, while making it cost-effective for them to support more serious users. </p>
<p>Still, a positive move. </p>

<p>One of the sad consequences of the pandemic is that this year, I'm not teaching students to edit video â€” all my lecturing is being done remotely, and one of the in-house team has taken on the editing training. Video editing is a very different thought process and skill set from text editing â€” but Descript is bringing the two together. </p>
<p>It started as a tool that allowed you to edit podcasts by editing a transcript of the audio â€” but now they've extended that approach to video. I'm looking forward to having a play with it when I get a little bit more time. </p>
