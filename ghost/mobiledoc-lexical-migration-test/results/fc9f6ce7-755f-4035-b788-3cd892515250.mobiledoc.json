This paint job is accented by the black, five-spoke wheels, but what really sets this package apart are the iconic screaming chicken decals and badges. Inside, the all-black interior gets the Collector Edition logo embroidered on the front headrests, and it also gets period-specific upgrades such as a 12-disc CD changer and a Passport radar detector."

A six-speed manual transmission was offered on these cars, but this one uses the four-speed automatic. Everywhere you look on this Trans Am, the car is clean and flawless thanks to proper care and an odometer that shows just over 7,900 original miles."
