From the outside, if it wasn't for the five-spoke wheels you might not even know this wagon is a custom vehicle, while the light blue paint and Bel Air-style fin trim make this car a true head turner."

Under the hood is a carbureted 350 cubic-inch LT1 V8 backed by a four-speed 4L80-E automatic transmission, and the car rides on a modified, lowered suspension. To make sure this 1957 Chevrolet Handyman is as fun to drive as it is to show off, it is equipped with four-wheel disc brakes, power steering and air conditioning."
