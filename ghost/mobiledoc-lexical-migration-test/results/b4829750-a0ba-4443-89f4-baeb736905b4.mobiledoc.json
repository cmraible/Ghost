Sitting on an aluminum-structured frame, the Z51 package includes a performance rear axle ratio and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Stopping power is provided by anti-lock disc brakes on all four corners that clamp via black-painted brake calipers. This high-performance C8 handles like a champ thanks to the FE1 Corvette suspension, all-speed traction control, and active handling stability control. Additional performance and additional rumble comes from an aluminized stainless steel exhaust that exits via stainless tips. Last but not least, the oil life monitoring system allows you to keep vital signs in check."
