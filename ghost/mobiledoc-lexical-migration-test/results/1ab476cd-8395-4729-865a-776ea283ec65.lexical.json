While for some collectors, who apparently have zero intention of actually driving a vehicle, a certain amount of disrepair is attractive, for others it’s horrifying since they firmly believe cars are meant to be enjoyed on the street or track, not just stationary sitting in some guy’s living room like a four-wheel statue. That’s why it’s wonderful to see a barn find hot rod in California rescued, fixed, and finally taken for a drive on the street.",
