<p>Showcasing unblemished coats of Fawn Gray paint with lashings of chrome, alongside an über-retro stance, we believe this could be the finest example of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/luxury">its kind</a> on the market. <br><br>An eye-wateringly expensive model when new, the optional Brougham package included a full vinyl top, C-pillar badging, bespoke seating with six-way driver’s seat memory, heated lumbar support, an upgraded instrument panel, and storage in the rear bench armrest.</p>

<p>Powered by a 5.7-liter V8 SPFI engine mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission, allowing for 17mpg in town and 26 upon cruising the freeway, the Brougham also came factory fresh with Anti-Lock Brakes, cruise control, a stainless-steel exhaust, cast aluminium wheels and Michelin All Season W/W tires.</p>
<p>With such gutsy internals, Caddy's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167340/1996-cadillac-fleetwood-brougham">Fleetwood</a> was no slouch. The luxury barge employed its quoted 260bhp to reach speeds upwards of 140mph (per official figures) and breach 60mph from a standstill in 8.2 seconds. The quarter mile was completed over 16 seconds – hitting 88mph; with only another 6.3 seconds before the 100mph barrier was violated.</p>

<p>According to the documentation that comes with the sale, this Cadillac cost $40,395 (roughly $70k with modern inflation) when originally requested from the showroom. <br><br>Price today? <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167340/1996-cadillac-fleetwood-brougham">The concours Fleetwood</a> now retails for $32,900. Paying that sort of money for a 23-year-old sedan may not make sense to those who think purely with their brain, but this would be a purchase made by the tangy heartstrings of nostalgia over common sense.<br></p>
