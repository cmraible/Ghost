However, upon closer examination of this display model it becomes apparent that it is not just another restored farm truck. Kindred has rebuilt the iconic farm truck and replaced the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) with an Electric Vehicle (EV) drivetrain. Production of the vehicle starts in 2024 but the impressive specs can be viewed on their website along with the opportunity to pre-order. At a retail price of $149,900 it seems to be right in line with the internal combustion counterparts. Understandably there will be some purists that think it is a sacrilege to replace the drivetrain with an electric motor but at Finding Old Cars we see the modification as an opportunity for a new generation to appreciate the trucks that farmed a generation.
