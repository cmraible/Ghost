However, some years things just get out of hand, and that certainly was the case for the 2022 gathering which took place on May 21. An unprecedented number of attendees made policing the crowds difficult, so things got out of hand. Authorities reportedly arrested over 100 people and at least 38 were sent to area hospitals, including 8 airlifted, as huge crowds descended on the Bolivar Peninsula."
