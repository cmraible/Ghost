The only thing you could do to top that is gift such a gaudy “build” to your girlfriend to try impressing all your social media followers. Well, a Malaysian influencer has checked all those horrific boxes."

And this is why social media has a negative effect on society."

And just what kind of over-the-top wedding will she demand?"

While we certainly wouldn’t kick a 718 Spyder out of our garage, we also don’t advocate for anyone buying such a supercar to impress their girlfriend or social media followers."

However, on closer examination the flower petals are actually paper money arranged to look floral. In other words, this relationship isn’t the last bit materialistic. She probably sticks around for his dashing personality and nothing more."
