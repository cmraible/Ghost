          "Losing a loved one is difficult, but losing a family member to a murder which has gone unsolved for years is even worse. That reality has driven a Memphis, Tennessee family to offer their beloved C4 Corvette and $10,000 cash for information leading to the killer of Dennis Gilliam. The hope is someone out there knows something which could crack this cold case wide open, finally leading to justice."

The family says in addition to the $10,000 they’re pledging to give an extra $500 a month for a year to the person who comes forward with information to put Gilliam’s murderer away."

They claim police told them the bullets fired during the night matched those from the murder scene. However, Nelson was only incarcerated for aggravated assault. The district attorney said there wasn’t enough evidence to bring murder charges against the man, despite Gilliam’s stepdaughter saying Nelson admitted to the crime."
