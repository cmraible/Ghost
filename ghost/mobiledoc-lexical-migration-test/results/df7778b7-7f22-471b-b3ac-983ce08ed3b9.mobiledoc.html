<p>Yes, humans have a tendency to screw things up, but every now and then, some of us do amazing things. This edition of Weekend Reader is dedicated to examples of human achievement, including scientists revolutionizing batteries for the good of the planet, a pop star breaking all the rules, an Indigenous runner who refuses to stay quiet, a icon of traditional values who abandoned everything he stood for, and an unassuming guy who pulled off one of the most mythical runs in bowling history.</p>
<p>Read all about it in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srJq9JIHO0"><strong>Dem Rep SLIPS & Says The Quiet Part Out Loud, FLAILS Justifying Big Pharma Ties</strong></a> (Rising)  — <em>Sirota was on </em>The Hill<em>’s “Rising” show to discuss “</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-spin-control-over-pharma-cash-and-drug-pricing-vote/"><em><strong>Dems Flail Over Pharma Cash And Drug Pricing Vote</strong></em></a><em>.”</em></p>
<h3 id="stuff-we%E2%80%99re-reading">Stuff We’re Reading:</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-23/future-of-energy-requires-cleaner-electric-batteries-to-solve-cobalt-problem"><strong>The Energy Future Needs Cleaner Batteries</strong></a> (Bloomberg Businessweek) — <em>“Solving the climate problem requires solving the battery problem, and solving the battery problem requires solving the cobalt problem. Among the companies springing up to do that, some are focusing on recycling cobalt out of spent batteries. Others are rethinking ore processing to make once-marginal deposits more cost-effective. A few are trying to mine the ocean floor… Balkanized, in parallel and at occasionally cross purposes, they’re working against the same clock.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/californias-vanishing-hippie-utopias"><strong>The Last Glimpses of California's Vanishing Hippie Utopias</strong></a> (GQ)  —  <em>“Although the last holdouts within these fading utopias are all uniquely compelling characters, it's the question of what they'll leave behind that has drawn us here. Living in strange homes of their own creation, forever fearful of building inspectors and outsiders, they've kept these structures hidden and shrouded in mystery. Will these dwellings languish as ruins of a lost civilization, relics of a long-obsolete 20th-century idea? Might some, like Berg's current project, be outfitted for new uses? Many seem on the brink of collapse, and before they're gone, I want to know what lessons they could teach us.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-artificial-intelligence-completed-beethovens-unfinished-10th-symphony-180978753/"><strong>How Artificial Intelligence Completed Beethoven’s Unfinished Tenth Symphony</strong></a> (Smithsonian) — <em>“The challenge seemed daunting. To pull it off, A.I. would need to do something it had never done before. But I said I would give it a shot.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/magazine/lil-nas-x.html"><strong>The Subversive Joy of Lil Nas X’s Gay Pop Stardom</strong></a> (The New York Times Magazine) — <em>“Nas’s project… is to move past the mainstream and publicly acceptable practice of queerness, which is often so divorced from actual sexual pleasure that it can feel neutered. It’s one thing to accept a gay person, as many do, by ignoring what we do behind closed doors. But it’s quite another to embrace gay people as sexual beings, who can also enact an identity — just as straight people so proudly, publicly and lucratively do — in part through sex itself.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/sports/2021/7/23/22587803/rosalie-fish-track-indigenous-women-washington"><strong>Rosalie Fish Wants to Be the Face of Change</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Ringer) — <em>“She paints a giant red hand across her mouth, stretching across her cheeks. Red is the color that spirits, that ancestors, can see, according to some Native traditions. The hand over her mouth is meant to represent and honor the Indigenous women who have been silenced through violence—sexual violence, physical violence, psychological violence—an epidemic that receives little national attention. ‘I had always known I was a target,’ Fish says.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/2/19/21052356/norman-rockwell-the-problem-we-all-live-with-saturday-evening-post"><strong>The Awakening Of Norman Rockwell</strong></a> (Vox) — <em>“Even the Norman Rockwell Museum can’t make sense of his late-life political transformation. Amid the familiar Rockwelliana on display there is 1964’s The Problem We All Live With — which his biographer Deborah Solomon, in her 2013 book, American Mirror, calls “the most famous painting of the civil-rights movement”— as jarring as it must have been in the pages of Look magazine more than 50 years ago. But it was only the first of his 1960s paintings to upend everything “Norman Rockwell” stood for.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/18/how-el-anatsui-broke-the-seal-on-contemporary-art"><strong>How El Anatsui Broke The Seal On Contemporary Art</strong></a><strong></strong>(New Yorker) — <em>“In a highly factionalized art world, Anatsui found universal acclaim. To formalists, he was an Abstract Expressionist who worked in aluminum refuse; to the postmodern and the post-colonially minded, a maverick interrogator of consumption and commerce; to Old Guard Africanists, a renewer of ancient craft traditions. To most, his work was simply beautiful, with transcendent aspirations rare in the self-reflexive context of contemporary art. As it turned out, the unfixed form wasn’t just a way of sculpting. It was the principle of a career that had opened itself to the world without sacrificing its integrity.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/magazine/quarantine-mustache.html"><strong>My Mustache, My Self</strong></a> (The New York Times Magazine) — <em>“On Black men, a mustache told a different story. It was fashionable, but it was more than that. On a Black man, it signified values: perseverance, seriousness, rigor. Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, Jacob Lawrence, Gordon Parks, Albert Murray, John Lewis, C.T. Vivian, Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Bayard Rustin, Joseph Lowery, Fred Shuttlesworth, Julius L. Chambers, Jesse Jackson, Hosea Williams, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Elijah Cummings: mustaches all. Classics.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2012/july/the-most-amazing-bowling-story-ever-bill-fong/"><strong>The Most Amazing Bowling Story Ever</strong></a> (D Magazine) — <em>“All you have to do is say the words ‘That Night’ and everyone at the Plano Super Bowl knows what you’re talking about. They also refer to it as ‘The Incident’ or ‘That Incredible Series.’ It’s the only time anyone can remember a local recreational bowler making the sports section of the </em>Dallas Morning News<em>. One man, an opponent of Fong’s that evening, calls it ‘the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen in a bowling alley.’ Bill Fong needs no reminders, of course. He thinks about that moment — those hours — every single day of his life.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/john-swartzwelder-sage-of-the-simpsons"><strong>John Swartzwelder, Sage of “The Simpsons”</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“The executives weren’t sent advance copies of the scripts, and they couldn’t attend read-throughs, even though they very much wanted to. All we had to do was please ourselves. This is a very dangerous way to run a television show, leaving the artists in charge of the art, but it worked out all right in the end. It rained money on the Fox lot for thirty years. There’s a lesson in there somewhere.”</em></p>
