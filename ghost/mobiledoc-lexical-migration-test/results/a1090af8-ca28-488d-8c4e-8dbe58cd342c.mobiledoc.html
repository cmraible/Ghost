<hr>
<p>Built in 1941, this former <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/original-1970-buick-riviera-provides-an-affordable-option/">Buick</a> dealership in the US Mid-West has for decades been home to hidden classic car treasures, nested away from prying eyes. Tom Cotter, host of <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-hunter-uncovers-rare-1969-trans-am-400-in-alaksa/">Barn Find Hunter</a></em>, jumped in to explore the stash after a tip-off. The curved-front building could not have been a more appropriate storage ground for the types of cars that would be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">discovered inside</a>.</p>

<p>Constructed during a time when America was preparing to enter <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-jeep-old-faithful-commercial/">WWII</a>, the building was an active Buick dealership from 1941 through to some time around 1990, when they moved to a location in another Iowa town. Upon entrance, the front end of the building looks like a sea of papers and random office materials, thrown everywhere and piled high.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to find a 1968 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/scoop-this-low-mileage-1972-de-tomaso-pantera/">DeTomaso</a> Mangusta camouflaged in the mess, under a set of car covers in what appears to be the former showroom of the dealership. The low-production <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/drive-this-modified-1974-de-tomaso-pantera/">Pantera</a> predecessor is sadly missing its powertrain and drivetrain, but does appear to be in excellent shape.</p>
<p>Moving deeper into the building, a variety of other cars including a Jaguar E-type, MGC GT, and Facel Vega that all look like they’ve been preserved in a time capsule for all these years.</p>
<p>A 1965 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-imperial-trashes/">Imperial</a> convertible gets special attention by the host, which is understandable considering how hard it would be to ignore this massive 413 cubic inch engine equipped car. There's also a Toyota R16-powered Austin-Healey Bugeye Sprite, and an MG TD, a car that owner Robert has loved since he was a teenager.</p>

<p>A beautiful representation from the French market is the 1957 Facel Vegas FVS with Mopar V8, and then it's onto the Italian MGC and Lamborghini Espada, which sports a V12 engine and looks like it might still be road-worthy.</p>
<p>A 1963 Jaguar Type-E is the last of the cars in the main area given a look, before the bodyshop area reveals a Willys <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1951-willys-jeepster-is-the-drop-top-you-want/">Jeepster</a> and Crosleys, before making the final stop at the Imperial fire-up to show off that Mopar V8 growl.</p>
<p>What the future holds for this collection isn't discussed by the owner of the hoard, but it’s one heck of a barn find, so hopefully there’s something special in-store for this eclectic bunch.</p>
