<hr>
<p>With pretty much everyone on lockdown for the current <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-covid-19-is-affecting-collector-car-auctions/">coronavirus outbreak</a>, you likely have a lot of free time on your hands. Yes, this means it’s the perfect opportunity to tackle those <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-to-clean-coronavirus-from-your-car/">car projects</a> you’ve been putting off. The video below shows how you can clean up that grimy, disgusting-looking chrome, stainless steel, or polished aluminum pieces on your <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a>. The best part is you don’t need any expensive tools or supplies and it’s not a difficult process.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of satisfaction to be derived from fixing up a car, whether you own a 1967 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Shelby/GT500">Shelby GT500</a> or a 2001 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Camaro%20SS">Chevrolet Camaro SS</a>. Even your daily driver needs some love. Taking pride in your ride is a solid move. It will make you feel better about your car and life in general. It’s just science.</p>
<p>This trick will work on all kinds of car parts, not just bumpers. Try it on badges, interior trim, headlight surrounds, wiper arms, door handles/pulls, hood ornaments, etc. As the guy points out, if you’re working with stainless steel or polished aluminum you might have to take off more grime, so it’s a little longer process. But the extra effort is definitely worthwhile.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that just because the guy is working on an old <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/hot-rods-and-restomods">hot rod</a> doesn’t mean this won’t work on any other car. Just keep in mind some newer cars have “chromed” plastic parts you can’t clean up this way. That should be obvious, but we’ll just make sure it’s clear to everyone.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the necessary supplies for this project, you can order them online and have them delivered. Really, you’re out of excuses on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-a-jeep-wrangler-yj-get-a-deep-cleaning/">cleaning up</a> the brightwork on your car, so get to it. You’ll feel a lot better to see how much better-looking your ride is after putting just a little bit of work into it.</p>
