Following a complete restoration back to original in the '90s and it was at Pebble Beach when Lincoln was the sponsored marque where it was proudly displayed on the 18th hole. According to Wu, this Lincoln is an original West Coast car in its original Black Cherry color with less than 48,000 original miles."

As sad as it is to hear when an all-original classic car gets modified, Wu definitely made the right call giving this drop top a killer West Coast look. The flawless condition and lowered stance makes this Lincoln a show stopper, but the coolest detail on the car is the custom billet aluminum center caps."
