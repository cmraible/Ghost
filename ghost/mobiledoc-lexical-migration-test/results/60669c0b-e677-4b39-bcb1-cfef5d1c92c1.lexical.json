In fact, it was such an aerodynamic racer compared to its competition that it dominated nearly every aspect of NASCAR in the late 1960s. Eventually this became so abundant that  the popular sports organization had to change up the rules, basically pushing the car out of the competitive lineup. Today, only a few examples of these legendary vehicles remain but now you might have a chance to get your hands on one.",

With a closer look youâ€™ll see a sharp cone sitting on the nose of what looks like a 1969 Dodge Charger. On top of that the rear end is emphasized by a massive wing which proved very useful in keeping the car planted to the ground. At high speeds, this is a very important part of the performance profile which is why they did so well on the NASCAR circuit. The best part of the whole situation is that this is a true Daytona, one of only 509 cars like it produced in 1969 making it just barely homologation compliant.",
