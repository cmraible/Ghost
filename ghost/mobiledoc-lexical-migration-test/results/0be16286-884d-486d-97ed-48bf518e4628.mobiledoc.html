<p>If you thought heading to <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/396596/american-racing-exhibit-henry-ford/">The Henry Ford</a> for spring break would be a nice distraction from all the bad news these days, think again. The museum has announced it is shut down completely, effective March 12 at 5 pm. For now, the plan is to keep everything closed for one week, then re-evaluate the situation on March 18.</p>

<p>Administrators explained in an <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/visit/coronavirus-precautions/">official press release</a> that as a national destination and a huge draw for travel into Michigan, it was in the public’s best interest to shutter The Henry <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/362131/ford-motor-company-history/">Ford</a>.</p>
<p>Included in the cancellations is the popular <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford">Ford</a> Rouge Factory Tour, which provides a glimpse into the automaker’s modern manufacturing practices. Visitors get a feel for how the current <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford/F-150">Ford F-150</a> is made, thanks to theater seats which vibrate, combined with gusts of air, robots, and 3D projection mapping.</p>

<p>This move also means all public programs scheduled at the museum through March 18 will be postponed or canceled. If you’ve already purchased tickets to the museum or an event, you’ll have the option of either donating the money or receiving a refund. Of course, the beautiful venue is also popular for private events, which are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, you could easily make a day of going to The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/classic-car-museum-bucket-list/">Henry Ford</a>, where quite a few classic cars are on display. The complex sprawls over 250 acres of picturesque landscape, which includes Greenfield Village, where <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford/Model%20T">Ford Model Ts</a> tool around paved roads, and you can go for a fun ride.</p>

<p>The Henry Ford emphasized it has taken several measures to ensure proper sanitation, even before the shutdown. Among them are more hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the complex, more cleaning products used by staff and volunteers, plus frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces like door handles, elevator buttons, etc.</p>
