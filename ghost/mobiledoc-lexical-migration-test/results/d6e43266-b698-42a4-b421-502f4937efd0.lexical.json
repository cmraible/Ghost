Yes, there are many cars with specifications like the ones above, but if you're looking for the best of the best, then there's only one place to turn. Of course, that brand is the ever-iconic Ferrari automotive manufacturer whose incredible life of performance, racing, and design will precede it for decades to come.

Sitting between the axles of this incredible is a high revving 4.3-liter V8 engine which is producing somewhere in the ballpark of 483 horsepower and 343 ft/lbs of torque. That is a considerable number for an Italian supercar like this one as it sports an incredibly light-weight chassis and excellent hooking ability. Speaking of the chassis, cornering, and handling is also significantly better than the car's competition. That is primarily due to the incredibly tight racing suspension initially placed into the vehicle from the factory and the strong wheels that add structural support and rigidity. ",
