And, like so many revolutions, we just exchanged one tyranny for another. We took the wire as our new ruler, and it bound us tightly to our desk. The electric cables to power our computers; the ethernet jacks connecting us to the internet; even the twisted copper of the phone line all conspired to keep us on the office’s side of the window.</div>\n\n[Theme Park](http://www.inthethemepark.com/blog#.UCkxIanbybw) is a great, interesting attempt at doing a deep, thought-provoking blog. Well worth a few minutes of your time.\n\n\n"
