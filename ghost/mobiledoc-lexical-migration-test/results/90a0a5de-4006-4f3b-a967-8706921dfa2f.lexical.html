<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As a supporting subscriber to <em>The Daily Poster</em>, you are making sure we have the resources to do high-quality, impactful journalism that gets results. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. You are part of the team that is building a new non-corporate, grassroots-funded media — and so I have a request for you.</p>
<p>We are right now trying to expand our work and hire more reporters. In order for us to do that, we need to sign up a few more supporting subscribers — and there are three specific ways you can help us do that:</p>
<p>1. If you are a monthly subscriber and have been thinking about becoming an annual subscriber, <strong>please <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>click here</strong></a> to do that</strong>. It would help!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Go to <a href="/gift"><strong>dailyposter.com/gift</strong></a></strong> and give people you know a gift subscription.</p>
<p>3. Participate in our exclusive friends and family special for subscribers — if you are already an annual subscriber, you can email your friends and family the link <a href="/friends"><strong>dailyposter.com/friends</strong></a> and they can get a special 15% discount off an annual subscription.</p>
<p>We’ve worked really hard to try to balance the need to raise resources with the desire to not price readers out of our publication — and I’m proud that our newsletter has a lower price than many others on Substack.</p>
<p>The downside is that we are doing all of our investigative reporting with fewer resources, which makes it harder — and more difficult to expand our work. However, that is a tradeoff we are willing to make because it embodies our values. We are building a 100% grassroots-funded media outlet, and we want it accessible to as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<p>In order for us to build out this project to a full newsroom, we periodically have to ask our subscribers for some extra help in spreading the word and building out our base of supporters. So thank you for understanding this request and for any help you can be.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being a subscriber — and thank you for any extra help you can be as we try to expand. Onward!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
