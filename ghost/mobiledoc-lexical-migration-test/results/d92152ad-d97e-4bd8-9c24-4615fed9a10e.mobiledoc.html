<p>Welcome back to the weekly digest of reader feedback. I‚Äôm keeping these member-only: it‚Äôs the walls that make the community, after all, and I want this very much to be a discussion between subscribers ‚Äî and me.</p>
<p>Just a reminder ‚Äì as well as sending comments via email, there is a comment facility below. You just need to log in with the email address you used to subscribe. Real names not required‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="comments-toxic-comments-and-statistics">Comments, Toxic Comments and Statistics</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.peter-ranscombe.com">Peter Ranscombe</a> provided some evidence that my point about real names not eliminating toxicity <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2023/01/the-times-tames-trolls-with-the-power-of-naming/">from yesterday</a> is correct. As he puts it:</p>
<blockquote>The xenophobia in the comments beneath <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/merryn-somerset-webb-080558_tax-scotland-personalfinance-activity-7026133532901003265-xxtl/">this LinkedOut post</a> back-up your assertion about people using their real names in comments sadly won't stamp out abuse.</blockquote>
<p>The link above will take you to the evidence, but here‚Äôs one example:</p>

<p>The quoted account <em>appears</em> to be real. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Earlier, Nick Petrie, late of <em>The Times</em>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-elliot-petrie/">now at Reuters</a>, pulled me up on my statistical thinking:</p>
<blockquote>I wonder what the overall decrease in commenting has been‚Ä¶ (if any). A better metric would have been what proportion of total comments were flagged as toxic daily and what it is now.</blockquote>
<p>And, dammit, he‚Äôs right. I really should have spotted that. The figures given for the piece are only meaningful if we know comment volumes. And, yes, another potential downside of a real names policy is putting some people off commenting entirely, even if they are perfectly civilised the whole of the time.</p>
<p>In a <em>very</em> 2010 move, Nick actually <a href="https://nickpetrie.co/cherry-picking-metrics/">wrote this up on his blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>By sharing the total number of toxic comments each day before and after the policy change, we can see it's 'worked' - there are fewer toxic comments. However what I am interested is the proportion or ratio. It's possible (even likely) that the total number of daily comments has decreased and as such the number of toxic comments is lower in absolute terms, but it might still be similar as a proportion of total comments.</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-tiktok-problem">The TikTok problem</h2>
<p>A telling off from <a href="https://disabilitydebrief.substack.com">Peter Torres Fremlin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Lots of interesting takes, thanks Adam, although I think the argument about the "China factor" in TikTok needs a bit more development to be convincing, given how skeezy US-big tech can be.</blockquote>
<p>Yup, and that‚Äôs a good point. In my defence, I‚Äôve been warning about Facebook for well over a decade. In particular, I remember growing slowly horrified when I realised some of my colleagues at RBI wanted to turn all the community activity we were building over to Facebook circa 2008/2009 and what the consequences could be. Much of what I warned about then came to fruition.</p>
<p>But I will return to the subject of TikTok, short form vertical video and what we <em>should</em> be doing as soon as I can.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the feedback, folks. Keep it coming.</p>

<p>This issue has a guest editorial assistant: my younger daughter, who is getting some unexpected work experience, thanks to the teachers' strike. </p>
