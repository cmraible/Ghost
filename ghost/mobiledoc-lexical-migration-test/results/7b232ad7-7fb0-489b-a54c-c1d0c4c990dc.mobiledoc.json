          "About a month ago, Hennessey showed a stock Grand Cherokee Trackhawk hitting the drag strip against a C8 that had been modified only with an aftermarket exhaust system. The supercharged Jeep might seem like it has the upper edge thanks to its 707-hp Hellcat Hemi going up against the 490-hp Chevy, but it also has a weight disadvantage tipping the scales at more than 5,300 pounds. Even with the extra weight, the Trackhawk still manages to put up a fair fight against the Corvette with a slight advantage off the line before succumbing to the C8's advanced performance."

A month later, the Jeep looks the same, but it shows up to the rematch with its 6.2-liter supercharged V8 tuned to produce an even 1,000 horsepower. Like the first race, the Jeep leaps to a quick lead, but the Corvette is never able to recover with half the horsepower. In the end, the Corvette gets gapped by almost the exact same amount that it served up to the Jeep in the baseline race."
