          "Reality these days is an assault of traumatic news, and things are likely to get more tumultuous in the future. But that’s why it’s more important than ever to find your own version of self care. When done right, self care isn’t narcissistic self-absorption or sticking your head in the sand —  it is an investment in mental resilience during an era when we most need it. The work of bettering the world is a marathon, not a sprint — and that’s why we have dedicated this edition of Weekend Reader to ways that we can pace ourselves, so we can all keep running that marathon."
