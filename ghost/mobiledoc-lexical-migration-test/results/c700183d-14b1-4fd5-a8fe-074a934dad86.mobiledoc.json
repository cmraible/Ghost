Players need to move around the map and gather a certain number of keys, and set them up. Once that’s done, everyone needs to move to a central point on the map. In other games of this genre, players would simply need to make it to an escape point. The standard strategy of the enemy would be to stand in front of that escape point to stop as many players from getting out. In this game however, players are required to spend roughly 30-45 seconds setting up the escape, in which they can do nothing else during that time. This makes them very easy targets for the enemy, making victory exceedingly difficult for the survivors. Another issue is that the enemy can destroy the escape time machine. This avenue is not the only means of winning, however it is the one the game guides you towards obtaining, and the second one only becomes available after this primary objective is destroyed by the enemy. I feel this is a step too far in imbalancing the game towards the raider, in a game where the raider is already given a breadth of advantages. "
