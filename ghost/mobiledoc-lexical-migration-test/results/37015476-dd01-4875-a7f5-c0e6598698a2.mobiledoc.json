Perhaps even better, the bed of this truck has an old-school look with dark wood and chrome strips, and it even has a little practicality with a hard tonneau cover and billet cargo divider â€“ not that anyone would ever dare to put anything in the bed."

The black paint job looks flawless, and it's perfectly complemented by the smoked headlights and taillights as well as the brushed billet handles on the doors and tailgate. Inside, this truck has low-back bucket seats with quilted leather on the seats and center console, and there are some eye-catching Plasti-dip accents inside the truck and under the hood with a really neat wood-like pattern."
