<p>In the 1980s, family life in the Tinworth household was often quite chill on a Sunday. We “took” the <em>Sunday Times</em>, and part of the ritual was dividing up the sections amongst the family. I liked the features sections, my Mum the women's sections and the magazine. My brother was straight in on the <em>Funday Times</em> and he battled with my Dad over the sport. </p>
<p>A newspaper, despite the name, is a lot more than news. And, if you want to build a sustainable, member revenue-driven business you <em>need</em> to understand that. Case in point, the <em>New York Times</em> subscriber growth is <em>down</em>, but the <a href="https://www.axios.com/new-york-times-subscription-gains-non-news-products-0690d5ea-9d7f-4225-97ce-9822200da996.html">source is shifting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>New subscriber growth was weighted much more heavily this quarter towards non-news products than in any other previous quarter in the company’s history. A record 44% of The Times’ new digital subscribers came from non-core news products, like cooking, games and audio, last quarter.</blockquote>
<p>I remember some snark from one of the many (too many) media newsletters I subscribe to about the <em>NYT</em> putting so much emphasis on games — including <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/everdeen-mason-joins-the-times-as-editorial-director-for-games/">hiring an editorial director for them</a>. It expressed a worry about newspaper losing their focus on, well, news. That missed the point: newspapers (and media generally) have always been about more than <em>just</em> news. As audience revenue matures as a business model, you'd do well to think about what connects with your members <em>emotionally</em> as well as <em>intellectually</em>. </p>
