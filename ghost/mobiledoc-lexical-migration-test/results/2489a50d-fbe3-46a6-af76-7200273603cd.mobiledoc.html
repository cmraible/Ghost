<p>At the second-ever UK event for <a href="https://www.goodingco.com/press/article/gooding-and-company-realizes-over-gbp22-million-at-london-auction-at-hampton">Gooding & Company</a>, the internationally acclaimed auction house and official partner of the Concours of Elegance, is reporting a closing number of £22,811,938, or $25,319,030. This includes seven cars sold for more than £1 Million, and a world auction-breaking lot.

<p>Held at the historic grounds of Hampton Court Palace, the London Auction features show stoppers, like the well-documented 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Berlinetta Competizione, selling for £7,762,500, or roughly $8.9 million USD. This one of the 31 out of the prestigious 39 lots sold during the auction. Another highlight was a world record-breaking sale of a 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ, selling for £1,181,250 ($1.35 million), making it the highest-priced Giulia ever sold.  Each lot was hand curated and vetted before coming under the hammer.</p>
