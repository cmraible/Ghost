<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2011-porsche-911-gt3-rs-4-0-3/">Of all the Porsches</a> which deserve recognition, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2011-porsche-911-gt3-rs-4-0-3/">this 2011 Porsche GT3 RS 4.0</a> is one of the best cars the German brand has ever produced. That’s a bold claim but one which many would agree with and for good reasons. Professional drivers have called the Porsche 997 GT3 RS 4.0 a wicked track weapon since it has both explosive power and razor-sharp handling, a combination which is downright lethal. This example has only 2,300 miles on the clock, and is available now for the Porsche collector who wants to round out their collection.</p>
