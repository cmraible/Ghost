The convertible top, hood, rear decklid and doors appear to be carried over from the 3000GT Spyder, but everything else is what you'll find on a Stealth including the body cladding, wheels and bumpers. Even the Dodge Stealth airbag was added to the interior. This car was done up to look like the Dodge Stealth R/T twin turbo, which is a counterpart to the 3000GT VR-4 this car started its life as.
