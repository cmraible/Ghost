A good portion of the curb weight is from the batteries located in the chassis, but removing those and the electric motor(s) to install a 6.2-liter V8 might actually result in a net loss of weight. Sure, more of the weight will inevitably be located toward the nose, but this LS engine looks to be shoved back far enough it sits no further than the front axle."
