He wants to lower the suspension, put on a “subtle” front lip, upgrade the 16-inch wheels for OE 17-inch wheels, and put on spacers for all 4 wheels. Honestly, that’s not all that wild, but some people think classics – and this could qualify as a classic these days – should be preserved and not modified at all."
