<p>Retro Studios has been quiet for some time, and many thought that they were working on <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> when that first got announced at E3 2017. However, that was quickly corrected and there are now rumors circulating that Retro Studios has been working on a Star Fox racing game in the similar vein as <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>.</p>
<p>Reddit user DasVergeben claimed that the racing title is “like Diddy Kong Racing mixed with F-Zero” with an adventure mode, hub world and boss fights.</p>
<p>We also got this logo posted from a visitor on 4chan, but definitely take this with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>Eurogamer has also stated that the details line up with what they have heard as of late, but I guess we’ll find out at E3 in less than a months time.</p>
<p>There was also word that Retro Studios had another game in the works, but that project is believed to be cancelled.</p>
