<p>One of the premier automotive events in the United States, Amelia Island Concours Week has something for everyone. That’s especially true if you’re a fan of hand-crafted vintage cars built prior to WWII. <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">RM Sotheby’s</a> is knocking out of the park with some fantastic classic vehicles crossing the auction block this weekend. Among the highlights is a <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/AM20/Amelia-Island/lots/r0046-1930-Cadillac-V-16-Sport-Phaeton-by-Fleetwood/841518?&utm_source=rmsothebys.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=AM20&utm_term=AM20_Highlights2&utm_content=lot_image&_cldee=cmFuZHkuenVzc21hbkBnbWFpbC5jb20%3d&recipientid=contact-b38ad7d6e941e9118222000c2971a03a-879ad15f3b194764b4533cbb5b96b565&esid=6790a8e1-9259-ea11-8243-000c2971a03a?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1930 Cadillac V-16 Sport Phaeton by Fleetwood</a>, a <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/AM20/Amelia-Island/lots/r0056-1938-Bugatti-Type-57-Cabriolet-by-DIeteren/843249?&utm_source=rmsothebys.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=AM20&utm_term=AM20_Highlights2&utm_content=lot_image&_cldee=cmFuZHkuenVzc21hbkBnbWFpbC5jb20%3d&recipientid=contact-b38ad7d6e941e9118222000c2971a03a-879ad15f3b194764b4533cbb5b96b565&esid=6790a8e1-9259-ea11-8243-000c2971a03a?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1938 Bugatti Type 57 Cabriolet by D’leteren</a>, and a <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/AM20/Amelia-Island/lots/r0051-1930-Duesenberg-Model-J-Convertible-Coupe-by-Murphy/841528?&utm_source=rmsothebys.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=AM20&utm_term=AM20_Highlights2&utm_content=lot_image&_cldee=cmFuZHkuenVzc21hbkBnbWFpbC5jb20%3d&recipientid=contact-b38ad7d6e941e9118222000c2971a03a-879ad15f3b194764b4533cbb5b96b565&esid=6790a8e1-9259-ea11-8243-000c2971a03a?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1930 Duesenberg Model J Convertible Coupe by Murphy</a>.</p>

<p>You just don’t see the kind of artisanal craftsmanship found in these fine examples. Each one has a flair which disappeared out of the industry after the war. Yet so many yearn after the flowing bodies and the fine detail touches throughout these cars, making them highly collectible.</p>
<p>For example, the 1930 Cadillac V-16 Sport <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1931-pierce-arrow-model-42-phaeton/">Phaeton</a> by Fleetwood is being offered without reserve. It’s estimated to hammer at upwards of $1,000,000 and for good reason. If this Bottle Green Cadillac looks somewhat familiar, it likely is, having been featured in quite a few books and magazines. Many agree it is one of the most beautiful bodies to be fitted to the early Cadillac V-16 chassis, with a mere 85 sport phaetons made. Out of those, only 17 are known to have survived.</p>

<p>Expected to hammer at between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000, the 1938 Bugatti Type 57 Cabriolet by D’leteren is wholly unique, being the only one built with a three-seater Aravis-inspired body style. The history of this car has been impeccably documented and includes an original D’leteren photo album with period photographs.</p>
<p>Another American classic, the 1930 Duesenberg Model J Convertible Coupe, is also being offered at no reserve, adding to the auction excitement. While nothing is guaranteed with a no-reserve car, this one is estimated to hammer at upwards of $1,800,000. These are incredibly rare classics, and this one in particular has won multiple awards from CCCA, AACA, and ACD Club.</p>
