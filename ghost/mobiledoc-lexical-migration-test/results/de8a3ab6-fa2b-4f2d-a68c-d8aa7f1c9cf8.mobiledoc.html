<p>Thanks to an undeniably Packard profile and that unique grill, anyone familiar with classic American cars will immediately recognize the origins of this vehicle. At the same time, Packard designers were already pushing past limits set before the outset of the war, such as the front fenders which flow seamlessly into the front portion of the doors.</p>

<p>Not only does this Packard exude grace with its smooth exterior design, when it debuted car shoppers remarked it was like riding on a “magic carpet.” That ultra-comfortable ride dynamics is afforded by five airplane-type shock absorbers as well as a lateral stabilizer, a setup which for the time was unusual.</p>

<p>Packards have a well-earned reputation for featuring large, plush interiors, and this one certainly doesn’t disappoint. Maroon upholstery with white accent piping, leather, wood, and chrome all have a sumptuous feel to them, plus there are amenities like a fold-down armrest in the backseat. Just as impressive is the 17.2 cubic foot trunk, where the NOS jack stand and spare Firestone whitewall tire are stored.</p>
