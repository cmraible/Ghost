<p>We’ve covered quite a few thefts of classic cars, but this one out of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/10-classic-and-collector-cars-stolen/">Kansas City</a> is especially bad. Not only did thieves make off with a 1970 Chevelle and 1970 Camaro, both of which were meant to be sold to benefit two local charities, the thieves seemed to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/cadillac-cts-v-kansas/">know exactly what they were doing</a>.</p>

<p>For two and a half years, both classic Chevy muscle cars had been stored in a building with plenty of security cameras and other measures meant to deter theft. However, according to a report from Fox 4 KC, that building has been targeted six times in the last three weeks by people who seem to know their way around.</p>
<p>The latest break-in involved the theft of the two classic Chevrolets. Both were owned by the same man who died recently. One of his final wishes was that all his assets be liquidated, the proceeds going to the Salvation Army and City Union Mission. It seems the thieves decided the two muscle cars should go to their benefit.</p>

<p>Keenan Post, an attorney who was close friends with the deceased, said the break-in happened in early May at 3 am. Nobody is certain what time the theft took place, though, because the suspects cut the feed for the security system, including the cameras. In other words, these people knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>However, security footage from several days before show some people walking around both outside and inside the building, possibly staking it out. They seem to know their way around and three of them keep their faces partially obscured. A woman who was along with the others didn’t cover her face and was busy looking at her cellphone.</p>
<p>Currently Kansas City Police Department is investigating the theft of these two cars. If you know anything about it, please contact them.</p>
