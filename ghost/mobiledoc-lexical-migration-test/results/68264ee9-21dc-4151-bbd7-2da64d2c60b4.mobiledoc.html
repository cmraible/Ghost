<p>When you mention the words "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gt350h-worth-salvaging/">barn find</a>," most folks think about a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-graveyard/">dilapidated muscle car</a> covered in dust and debris. Others might imagine a classic sports car that's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-find-1969-dodge-charger-r-t-magnum-440-has-been-parked-for-22-years/">seen better days</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-9059845/Vintage-Bugatti-thats-missing-HALF-CENTURY-sell-7million.html">This is Money</a> has reported on one of the most incredible barn finds ever, which was unearthed in North Staffordshire, England. It's a rare, desirable prewar Bugatti, and it looks to be in amazing condition despite its age and its "barn find" status.</p>

<p>This 1937 Bugatti Type 57S is one of the most desirable Bugattis ever built. If you know even a little bit about prewar cars, then you know that that's really saying something.</p>
<p>The "S" in the name stands for "Surbaissé," which is French for "lowered." Indeed, this sporty, low-slung two-seater reminds us of a channeled hot rod – but far classier.</p>

<p>The Bugatti Type 57S is powered by a 3.3 liter straight 8 engine. In its day, this sleek roadster was one of the fastest cars in the world, with a top speed of around 115 miles per hour. That was pretty impressive for the late 1930s.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the car seen here actually represents one of three factory lightweight chassis produced in 1936. It might be the only one used as a road car.</p>

<p>Apparently, the car's previous owner drove it until 1969, at which point the car was stashed in a workshop until the owner's death. Now, this rare machine, still appearing to be in relatively good condition, will head to auction.</p>
<p>This car will be sold by Bonhams as part of their Legends of the Road sale, which begins on February 19 in London. Bidding is expected to surpass $5 million.</p>
