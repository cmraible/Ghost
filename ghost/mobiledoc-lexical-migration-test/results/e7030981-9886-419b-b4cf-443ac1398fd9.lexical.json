In order to keep the body of the car looking pretty good even after the job is done, he layers the car with some clay which acts like a sort of wax. Looked at is a highly skilled action, the clay should provide a lot of protection if done right. All that was really left was to clean out the interior, and pull out all of the rodent skeletons within. Overall, the car looked fantastic after its thorough washing and you really have to wonder what it’s going to be like once the vehicle is finally restored. Perhaps we will even see it again once the job is finished.",
