          " 75th year of leading the way in the automotive industry and its models of the time were reflective of a continued ambition to make some of the most luxurious cars in America. However, making some of the most luxurious American cars typically has also meant making large, inefficient vehicles and in the wake of the Arab Oil Embargo, the US Government made it clear that it was time for that to change.

          "was redesigned to be lighter and more efficient. For any other manufacturer, this could’ve resulted in turning a luxurious roomy car with plenty of power into a cramped uncomfortable slouch that nobody wanted, but not for Cadillac. Instead, the higher roofline and shortened and narrowed redesign made for a Deville that was more spacious and more comfortable and despite losing the massive 500-cid engine from the previous years, the Deville was more efficient and power nearly remained the same."

It was purchased new from Rodgers Cadillac in Knoxville, TN and has since only been driven 14,609 actual miles. With straight body lines and a nearly perfect factory Crimson finish and contrasting white vinyl top, this car has clearly been very well taken care of. Likewise, the interior is every bit as stunning as the exterior. "

A tilting steering wheel allows for a full view of the clear gauges and a factory air conditioner and AM/FM stereo only adds comfort.
