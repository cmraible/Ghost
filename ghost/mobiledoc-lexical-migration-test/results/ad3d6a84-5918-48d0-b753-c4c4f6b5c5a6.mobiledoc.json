          "This  was acquired by Jeff Gamroth in the late '80s as a street car with factory GT parts, and was used for historic racing while being purchased by Gordon Barron in the late '90s. Gamroth was a continued supporter through 2001. That's when the Porsche ended up in the hands of John Zupan who was supported by Doug Esterbrook while in his possession. In 2013, the car was purchased from Zupan's estate by Monte Shelton. The current engine and transmission setup was built by Dick Elverud for Shelton along with other modifications that include the adjustable remote-reservoir JRZ coil-overs all around, adjustable sway bars, body-colored roll cage, and 15-inch Fuchs wheels wrapped with Hoosier slicks (215/60) on all four corners. Also installed were a set of 911 Turbo tie rod ends. A second set of Fuchs wheels with Hoosier ran tires are included with the car."
