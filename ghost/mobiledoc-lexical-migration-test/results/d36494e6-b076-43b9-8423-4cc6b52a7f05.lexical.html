<p>Just a quick reminder that starting at 7:30pm ET (4:30pm PT) tonight, <em>The Daily Poster</em> will be hosting a subscriber-only live chat with Sirota, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser about GOP legal challenges that tried to suppress the vote, the ongoing legal battles about the election results and the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pence-and-gop-senators-could/">theory</a> that Republicans could try to intervene to shift the Electoral College results.</p>
<p>You can start posting your questions for Sirota and the guests in the chatroom <strong>right now</strong> and during the event. We suggest logging in to the event a few minutes early (or even right now) to start posting your questions.</p>
<p><em>Please note: this is our third live event and we are still getting through all the tech issues, so bear with us! And remember - video of the event will be available to subscribers once it is finished, so you won’t miss out!</em></p>
