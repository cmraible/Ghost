<p>Lake Como, which is located in the Lombardy region of northern <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/learn-about-the-iso-grifo/">Italy</a>, houses a surprising collection of cars in its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/interesting-cars-found-underwater/">murky depths</a>. Well, it’s surprising and yet it’s not, because the Italians just like Americans and plenty of other societies apparently like to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/divers-40-cars-tennessee/">dump cars in large bodies of water</a>. A video shows just how big of a problem it is in the area, with dozens of cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-pulled-from-cape-fear/">sitting underwater</a>, many looking like they’ve been there for some time.</p>
<blockquote><em>See a Mustang get pulled out of the waters at Cape Fear <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-pulled-from-cape-fear/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>It’s difficult to tell exactly what we’re looking at. Like we’ve seen before, these cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/missing-womans-sunken-pontiac/">filled up with water and then flipped</a>, settling on their roof for the most part, so we’re treated to plenty of rusting undercarriages. Although, anyone who’s rescued a classic Italian automobile might agree this is actually a pretty common sight out of the water.</p>

<p>Most of these cars are probably <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-leno-drives-a-1958-fiat-600-multipla-mirafiori/">Fiats</a> or something similar. They seem to have skinny wheels (and whatever’s left of the tires) as well as incredibly compact frames. In a way that’s good, because if there’s a Lamborghini, Ferrari, Maserati, or something actually cool down there we would be distraught. Losing a bunch of Fiats is really no loss at all, other than the pollution in the lake.</p>

<p>We’ve seen all kinds of cars found and even recovered from lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water. Usually there’s a no-good reason for it, if one can ever be determined. Insurance fraud is a big one, but so is car theft. We’d be willing to bet a fair number of these cars were used to commit crimes after they were stolen, then they were dumped. The worst is when a dead body is found inside a submerged car, signaling that something far more sinister is behind the reason the vehicle was hidden away.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPBD9PiZ-k8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
