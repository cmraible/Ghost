Besides that, there were only 2,501 1970 Mach 1s with a 428 Cobra Jet with Shaker hood, so the fact this car comes with both those features already makes it quite the find."

All the sheet metal is original, but this was a Texas car so it wasn’t driving around on salted roads during harsh winters. During the restoration, which was done in 2017 to factory specs, NOS parts were used whenever available. The C6 automatic transmission and 3.00 Traction-Lok differential are the factory-original equipment, just like the engine."
