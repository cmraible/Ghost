Not all of the discovered gems result in sales, but this 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 wearing the ultra-rare Hugger/Monaco Orange did end up in his hands. It’s an exciting find and one that will no doubt provide Nichols with a sweet profit."

While the paint is going to need some serious work, considering someone did a shoddy repaint that includes stripes on the hood which are far wider than the original.  There’s still the factory cowl induction hood, plus the original carb. The interior is all-original and in shockingly good condition, supporting the claim that it’s a low-mileage Chevelle."
