All of you car people, like myself, will know the name GT500 very well for this point and will also be excited to learn that this is an example of just that. Under the hood is a Paxton supercharged V8 engine, one of just 33 GT350s made this way. Today it can be easy to think of that as not being extremely impressive but in 1967 that was virtually unheard of in a production car. Of course, the party doesn't stop at the flywheel either as the Shelby brand is dedicated to the pursuit of performance and a great driving experience.",
