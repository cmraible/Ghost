From there, the high-lux convertible received exclusive styling cues with the most notable being those massive 20-inch forged wheels, a unique front bumper and Maybach badging; this car was only offered in three colors (Zircon Red, Cote d'Azur Blue and Diamond White) with this particular car obviously being the latter paired with a blue top."

The seats get a really cool waterfall upholstery design with quilted pattern inserts and embossed Mayabch logos throughout the interior, and the added exclusivity also includes projected Maybach logo puddle lights and special \"1 of 300\" lettering displayed on the center console. In addition to the exclusive elements, the Maybach S650 Cabriolet comes loaded with every option that the standard S-Class coupe offers including Swarovski headlamps."
