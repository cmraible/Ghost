All of that having been said, the ‘68 is using an engine which was made from innovations that the Hellcat came with from the factory. So the real catch for a lot of people is the custom bodywork and paint job. It seems like the ‘68 takes the cake here because it just represents everything the brand worked so hard to achieve, as well as its fan  base of builders.",
