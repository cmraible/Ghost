The combat isn't all about mashing buttons either; if you have more that one attack charged, you can \"cancel\" one attack into another, meaning that you can quickly use multiple attacks in quick succession of each other; doing so will improve your interlink level within each given fight, allowing you to improve the abilities of your Ouroboros form and use said form within your chain attacks (oh, I haven't mentioned that yet.
