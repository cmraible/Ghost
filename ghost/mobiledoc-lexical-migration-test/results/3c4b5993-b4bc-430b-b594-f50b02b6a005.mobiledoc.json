Automakers are absolutely in love with technology at the moment, we think because it justifies pushing car prices ever higher. But shoving all kinds of advanced systems into cars, especially with the push toward electrification and autonomous drive systems, means today’s vehicles require far more microprocessors than ever."

Compounding the problem is the fact car microprocessors by nature must have a longer lifecycle than in consumer electronics and endure sitting in extreme temperatures. That’s why automakers can’t just use the same chips made for other industries."
