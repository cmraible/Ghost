People get emotional about LaFerraris, which had a production run capped at 499 for the global market. Many accused Aubameyang of ruining his, even though a wrap can easily be removed without damaging the original paint, which is the whole point of the car. Anyway, the rarity of these LaFerraris has helped the value appreciate considerably with no sign of that stopping anytime soon."

Anyone can tell these are Lambos because of the aggressive, angular aesthetics which have become the staple for the raging Italian bull’s car lineup for a few decades.
