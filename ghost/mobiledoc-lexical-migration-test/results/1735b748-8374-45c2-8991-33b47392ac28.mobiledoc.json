This example features the lightweight headlights and Porsche-exclusive clear taillights. Even the door skins are made of lightweight aluminum. According to the description, Xpel paint protection film was installed over the bumper, front fenders, hood, and mirrors. For the carbon fiber, a matte finish was applied so it shows in the correct finish. A set of black forged center-lock wheels (19x9 front, 19x12 rear) wrapped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber (245/35 front, 325/30 rear) sit on all four corners. Behind the wheels are Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with six-piston calipers up front and four-piston calipers in the back all in a red finish."

Shifting that power down to the rear wheels is a 6-speed manual transaxle with a factory limited-slip differential and oil cooler system. The previous owner modified the car with a Fabspeed ECU tune, Fabspeed cat-less exhaust system with headers, a lightweight flywheel, and Sachs clutch kit.
