With each use of a skill, it levels up a little and utilising skills takes charges which you acquire by moving around with your precious turns; many times, you will be better served simply whacking enemies with your scythe rather than using the often expensive and hard to use skills. I have found that the best way to level up skills isn’t to organically utilise them throughout your run as you climb the tower but instead, to leave one harmless enemy alive and run laps around it to build charges and utilise the skill repeatedly on nothing at all until it levels up.
