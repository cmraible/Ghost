Eternal keeps up the relentless nature that other DOOM games are famous for – wave after wave of demonic enemies in a hellish and gory setting.

There are plenty of RPG elements which allow you to upgrade your suit, weapons and abilities and a whole host of unlockables which will keep you coming back for more. There’s also plenty of nods to the original DOOM games and why not when you have such an iconic IP to call upon. Also, it’s easy to think of DOOM Eternal as a mindless shooter but the platforming in this game is genius too; you really have to think about how best to traverse some platforming areas of the game which are almost like giant interactive puzzles.",

I always found DOOM and Quake games too dark (in more ways than one) and depressing, and was also frustrated with Doom in that you couldn’t jump or look up and down. That said, DOOM is still a masterpiece of course, however for these reasons, Duke Nukem 3D and its various expansion packs was by far my favourite series because there was a lot more freedom of movement and it was also a lot more light-hearted. Sure Duke Nukem 3D had some scary bits (like the Octobrains which terrified me and still do), but it just felt a bit more cheery to play. Whilst the DOOM series reboot fixes all of the mobility issues, it’s still pretty dark and yet, if moody, gothic and apocalyptic settings are your thing, then this is most certainly the game for you.",
