          ", cars like the 1977-1981 Trans Am and the 1969 Dodge Charger have a special place in American automotive/pop culture history. Interestingly though, it's not always good enough to just include the car doing some awesome stunt in the movie. You’ve got to name it, too. For us, it doesn’t get much better than the General Lee, Bandit, Bullitt, Black Beauty, or even Christine. But probably the most iconic famous car has to be the one that is notorious for being there one minute and gone the next - Eleanor."

Regardless of how well some of them were done and how interesting the build videos were, the likeness of the great Eleanor is, unfortunately, under copyright. So if you want to build a highly modified 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500, you had better not call it Eleanor. But if you want to buy one, you now can, and, best of all, it's not a replica. It is the real thing."

While it is unclear exactly how much money the seller is seeking in exchange for the car, but it probably will be record breaking."
