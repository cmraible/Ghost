The current owner talks a lot about the badging and exterior features which would confuse pretty much any enthusiast regardless of their knowledge. Overall, the 327 badges made things extra confusing but in the end the owner assumes the car is an SS because of the P-code.",

All of this is made even better by the fact that it was, before the current owner’s acquisition, a race car that sported a 396 cubic inch V8. So the simple answer here to the question of what this car is would be, nobody knows. That being said, there is no reason to assume the owner is wrong or lying about his own vehicle so for now it appears to be a true RS/SS in the flesh.",
