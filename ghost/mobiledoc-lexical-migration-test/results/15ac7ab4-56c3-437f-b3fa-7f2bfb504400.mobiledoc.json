          "Another Paul Newman car, the actor apparently spent a lot of time behind the wheel and must have truly enjoyed it. That might have been because it was one of his first racecars, creating a sentimental bond for the man."

          "Developed in secret through a collaboration between Nissan’s headquarters in Japan and BRE in Los Angeles, this car was entered into the 1968 SCCA season and helped turn around the suffering Datsun motorsports program. The fact Carolla owns one shows he is a big Nissan/Datsun nut."

          "Lovingly called the Batmobile, this racer terrorized the competition on the European touring car racing circuit for almost a decade. Many Bimmer fans fantasize about owning one, even if it’s one of the homologation specials sold to consumers and not the track-only version like what Carolla has."
