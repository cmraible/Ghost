<p>Ah, it's been a good long while since a link to a Jeff Jarvis post appeared on this site. However, I think he's right here. However much that internet has brought bad things into our life and society, it's still a net benefit (haha). </p>
<p>Imagine how the last year would have looked <em>without</em> the internet…</p>
<p>It's worth taking the time to remember that — and to think more about how we can preserve the good things while minimising the harms. </p>

<p>This is the ideal for us all, isn't it?</p>
<blockquote>I get so many lovely emails in response to my newsletter, I absolutely love my readers. They are such an engaged, interesting bunch. A lot of the responses are just really lovely saying thank you for writing the newsletter and how much they enjoy it, which I LOVE getting but don’t really know what to say in response… I am still figuring that out!</blockquote>

<p>Who is more responsible for climate change: you, personally, or the corporate and governmental systems that make up our society? The fact that I can even ask that question without it seeming so reductively obvious as to be pointless demonstrates the degree to which corporations have successfully shifted blame using PR concepts. </p>

<p>Anyway, this is a fascinating tale of how a branch of Samsung found a way forwards on innovative phone reuse… and the corporate bigwigs killed it. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed this talk — especially given that the speaker was a last-minute replacement for someone else. Anyone doing product or audience work in journalism would be well-advised to think about some of these issues: </p>
