          " 431A Series once owned by American gangster, Al Capone. Harry LeBreque first purchased the car in May of 1933 from Patrick Moore. Moore passed away and his surviving daughter was Pat Denning, who mentioned that her parents bought car from an agent in Chicago believed to be used by Al Capone. First believed to be bought in Connecticut, it turns out the car was purchased in Chicago."

          "With relations through marriage and connected to the mob, it only makes sense that one of his clients would be Alphonse Capone. Two V-16s were owned by Capone, and one of them was used to chauffeur Warden David Moneypenny. In an article by the Milwaukee Sentinel, Denemark stated that the chaperone car no longer belonged to Al as both cars were repossessed due to non-payment. It is said that Denemark was only covering for the most dangerous man in Chicago. A license plate check revealed it registered to Mae Capone, and Denemark said that the plates had not been removed yet."

One of the sixteens was listed among other vehicles, and after making headlines, it gained attention by the Feds. With everything panning out, the car was listed through an agent on Capone’s behalf just as Denning mentioned, and that agent was Emil Denemark."

          "In 2008, Richard “Cappy” Capstran, 93, mentioned that he helped install some of the armor on the Cadillac as a young boy in his father’s shop. Having performed work to one of Capone’s other cars, soon after, this new Cadillac was delivered to the shop. When given the work list to be done to the  Caddy, the father explained that they “don’t do that kind of work here” where Capone’s men responded with “you do now.” According to Capstran, who remembers the situation vividly, mentioned that the car was backed into the shop so nobody passing by could see the work being done to the car. Capone paid double the asking price and handed Cappy a $10 bill."
