That’s right, the much-rumored all-electric C8 Corvette has been officially announced. Despite no real information revealed by GM on Monday, many automotive outlets and even mainstream news was just slobbering all over the announcement like a bunch of girls fainting at a Beetle’s concert."

          "An electrified C8 Corvette was revealed with a video that dropped on the 25th (I’ve included it in case you’re not sick of it already). In it we see what looks shockingly similar to a C8 Stingray frolicking in the snow. Sure, it’s wearing some camouflage and has tailpipes, or in other words what we’re seeing is the gasoline-electric hybrid which will come out early next year, but nothing makes it immediately distinctive. Maybe the production version will have lightning bolt graphics down the side or something cool like that."

          "Anyway, we see the C8 Corvette spin its tires a lot as it whips around an arctic test course. Automakers use such grueling tests to see how their vehicles handle the extreme temperatures – they test a lot here in Arizona as well. But the whole time I’m watching the video I’m wondering how many times they would have to stop and recharge the car using a diesel generator if this were the all-electric version. I mean, come on, batteries don’t perform nearly as well in such frigid temperatures, with many EVs seeing their ranges cut by a large percentage when everything turns frozen."

After all, you’ve been told EVs are automatically superior to those dino-juice-sipping fossils all your neighbors and dumb family members drive. If you pull up to the next gathering with this thing or even better the all-electric ‘Vette, everyone will know how sophisticated and interesting you truly are."

We’ve already seen hybrid performance cars do extremely well as they blend the best of both powertrain technologies. Plus, you don’t have to worry about range like you would in an all-electric car."

Last summer he claimed he was promised he’d get to drive one. He also sees a leprechaun in the corner of the room, so you’re forgiven if you didn’t take that seriously. GM has finally confirmed the all-electric C8 will be released after the hybrid, but it won’t say when exactly."
