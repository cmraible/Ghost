<p>Though the original four-cam engines designated Type 547 could be stroked to achieve the 2-liters required by the 2000GS and 2000GT models unveiled in 1961, the engines were tapped out when it came to bore size. To combat the issue <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0321/open-roads--march/lots/r0056-1962-porsche-356-b-carrera-2-coupe-by-reutter/1055633?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0321">Porsche developed</a> the Fuhrmann derivative designated Type 587/1 for use in the 2000GS and 2000GT models. Both of the 356 models were capable of a 0-60-mph sprint in less than 10-seconds and reaching a top-speed of over 120-mph. In the 2000GS, the engine produced an incredible 130 bhp at 6200 rpm when paired with a set of Solex 40 mm carburetors. With the extra bump in power, the new <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0321/open-roads--march/lots/r0056-1962-porsche-356-b-carrera-2-coupe-by-reutter/1055633?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0321">Porsche model</a> required a few more modifications that further guided the future of the brand. Among the deviations from the traditional <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/porsche-959-komfort/">Porsche</a> were additional oil radiators installed in the nose to help keep the air-cooled engine at proper temperature and a disc brake system.</p>

Originally sold in Paris and fitted with the amber headlamp and fog lamp lenses required by France, this car may have been a special order based on the rare Slate Gray over Light Brown color combination. It had two owners in Paris before being sold to the then president of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/a-porsche-icon/">Porsche</a> 356 Club of France who began to restore the car but sold it to a German road construction firm owner who picked up where the restoration left off. Since 2001, the car has been with its current owner who, after an appraisal by Peter Deusche at Ingenieurbüro Deusche GmBH in Wildberg, Germany, finished the restoration by returning the car to its original color.</p>
