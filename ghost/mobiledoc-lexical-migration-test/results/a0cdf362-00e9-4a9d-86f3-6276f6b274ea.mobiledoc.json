The Brit worked his way up and into Formula 1 itself, but saw great success in other categories such as endurance racing. 29 years on from winning the 24 Hour of Le Mans, he’s back in the driver’s seat of the iconic Jaguar XJR-12.

He relished how linear the naturally aspirated V12 engine still is, and its abundance of torque. Just listen to this car sing as the racer rows through that manual gearbox! Brundle isn’t dawdling, but really stretching the historic car’s legs."

It grows, and grows, and grows as it gets hotter, and it goes bang! It takes the right rear corner, brakes, and aerodynamics with it. So now you’re on three wheels doing 230mph.’"

Alex exclaimed ‘The stability is just insane!’ and also went on on the praise the high levels of torque characteristic of a large V12."
