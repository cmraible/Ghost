This is a front engine, two-wheel-drive, two-seater roadster was powered by a 2.7-liter DOHC V-6 borrowed from the second-generation Dodge Intrepid, so if you compare it to the Viper, it feels like a dud. The car is often called the younger brother of the Viper, but the price and performance points would have positioned it more as a Honda S2000 competitor."
