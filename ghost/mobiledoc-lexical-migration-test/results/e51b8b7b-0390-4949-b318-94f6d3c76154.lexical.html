<p>1969 marked the beginning of the NASCAR <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0521/open-roads--may/lots/r0040-1969-dodge-charger-daytona/1093550?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">aero-wars</a>. Four of the biggest names in American Racing all wanted the same thing, to be known as the fastest to go around the oval track. Ford and Mercury had the Torino and Cyclone as their race cars that they upgraded with the respective Talladega and Spoiler II packages. These cars kicked off the battle, however, Dodge had its rebuttal and in 1969 it released a special edition model that absolutely dominated in the aero-wars - the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0521/open-roads--may/lots/r0040-1969-dodge-charger-daytona/1093550?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">1969 Dodge Charger Daytona</a>. </p>

<p>From its very first race, the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/0521/open-roads--may/lots/r0040-1969-dodge-charger-daytona/1093550?utm_source=Motorious&utm_medium=adv&utm_campaign=0421">Daytona</a> was a race-winning design. It featured a cone shaped sheet metal nose that was able to cut through the wind faster than anything else on the track. A 23-inch-tall stabilizer wing on the rear deck added stability at higher speeds and the recessed rear glass was traded for a flush design. Besides its ridiculously unique looks, the Daytona featured many mechanical upgrades over the regular Charger models. Heavy-duty suspension and braking systems underpinned the model and Dodge offered the choice between two engine options. Buyers could have the 440-cid Magnum engine as a standard option or opt for the 426-cid HEMI. In all Dodge made 503 examples, making these cars incredibly rare and highly collectable today.</p>
