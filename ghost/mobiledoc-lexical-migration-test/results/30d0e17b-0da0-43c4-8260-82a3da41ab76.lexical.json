That kind of longevity is impressive and it comes for good reasons, among which is the lightweight and simple nature of the car. However, to the chagrin of many a Ford fan, the usual thing to drop into a Model A is a Chevy LS thanks in no small part to their being ubiquitous. That’s why we just had to share this incredible build where the ’31 Ford Model A is using a 5.0-liter Aluminator SC crate engine for Ford purity.",
