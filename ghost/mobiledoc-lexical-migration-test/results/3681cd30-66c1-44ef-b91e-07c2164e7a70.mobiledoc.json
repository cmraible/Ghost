Stealth mechanics see you crawling under tables and desks waiting for raptors to pass by or get distracted, which you can do by using your multi-tool once you’ve unlocked it. This multi-tool will allow you to activate speakers or other machinery to get the dinosaur's attention so you can pass by undetected. You’ll then be able to complete one of many PC or door mini-games without interruption. Of course, new dinosaurs will be introduced as you progress, requiring new strategies to plan out your next move in order to avoid any new threats. There were some very cool moments in the game but I don't want to spoil them for you here."

The first one is restoring the power while crawling around the floor while avoiding broken glass, trying to not make any noise at all. This was frustrating as you are required to plug power cords into electrical sockets to open a door, but it's just so fiddly to actually do. Just that single action alone makes a lot of noise, which attracts a raptor that keeps randomly appearing from around the area, resulting in plenty of trial and error. Secondly, there’s a section where you're using the monorail, but the less said about that, the better. These two sections made me really mad and I very nearly gave up on them both as they were so frustrating. "
