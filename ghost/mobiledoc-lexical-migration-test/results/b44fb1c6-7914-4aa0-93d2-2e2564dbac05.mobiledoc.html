<p>In 1967, a small run of 2,048 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/111978/1967-ford-mustang-shelby-gt500" rel="noopener">Shelby GT500s</a> were produced, and according to a Marti report, only 8 like this exact example were ever built. This striking <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-this-2021-gt500-and-25k/">GT500</a> was only three years old when it was put into storage somewhere in Alabama, effectively preserving what rolled off the original Ford dealers lot. This incredible (true) survivor remained untouched until 2005, when it was woken from its sleep to get a complete rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The underrated 355-horsepower 428 Police Interceptor V8 has been fully rebuilt, along with the two 4BBL Holley carburetors. Being sure to preserve originality under the hood, only correct parts were used for parts that had to be replaced, everything that needed to be and could be rebuilt was, and documentation of the restoration was well kept.</p>
<p>The original C6 3-speed transmission and 3.50:1 geared TractionLoc 9-inch rear end are in good shape as is the interior of the car. The factory comfort-weave bucket seats, Shelby wood steering wheel, and original carpets show only mild fading and the gauges are clear and bright.</p>

<p>Considering the value of a well restored ’67 GT500 is, according to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/hagerty-unearths-the-ultimate-classic-car-barn-find">Hagerty</a>, upwards of $250,000 and in 2013 the one of a kind 1967 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/2020-1967-shelby-gt500-drag-race">Shelby GT500</a> Super Snake sold for $1.3 Million, it is not that surprising that the price tag on this survivor is nearly $400,000. While its not got a mirror polished finish, the unmarked factory sheet metal and original paint allows for an unprecedented look into the past.</p>
<p>With all original glass and lenses, factory emblems, and even the original dealers badge on the tail this truly remarkable car will surely make a lasting impression on anyone who sees it.</p>
