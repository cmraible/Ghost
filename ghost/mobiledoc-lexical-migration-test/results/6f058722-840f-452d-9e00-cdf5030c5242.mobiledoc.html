<p>Chevrolet only <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/AZ0321-470644/1967-chevrolet-corvette-l88-coupe/">produced the L88</a> from 1967-1969 and in those three years only 216 were actually made. If divided up equally that would be around 70 examples per year, but that's not quite how it played out. In the first year only 20 L88 Corvettes were made and only one of them is known to have been finished in Sunfire Yellow. On top of that, this Corvette is the only L88 to receive the Duntov and Triple Diamond-awards while still being equipped with its original engine. The car has undergone a meticulous 10-year restoration and includes its original, matching numbers 430-horsepower 427-cid engine, an M22 Rock Crusher 4-speed transmission, a transistorized ignition, heavy duty power brakes, and an F41 suspension.</p>
