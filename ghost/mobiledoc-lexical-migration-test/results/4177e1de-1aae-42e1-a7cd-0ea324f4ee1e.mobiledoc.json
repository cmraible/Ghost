The little pony was mangled pretty badly, but you can see in the video we’ve embedded there are some fat slicks on the rear and thanks to crumpled front end you can see the huge turbo mounted there. At least one bottle of nitrous oxide was also visible in the wreckage. This looks like a serious build which probably set the owner back considerably. If he had that much cash, why not go to the track? We suspect it has something to do with the thrill of illegal racing, and now he’s paying the price of chasing the dragon."
