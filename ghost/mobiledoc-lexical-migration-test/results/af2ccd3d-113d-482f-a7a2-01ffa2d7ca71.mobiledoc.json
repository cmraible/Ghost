This drop-top Lambo appears just as captivating as when it was brand new, a testament to how lovingly cared-for it must have been previously. It also still wears the factory Hermera wheels and badges, so you get the authentic look."

Making it even easier to handle is the 6-speed manual transmission with automated shifting and clutch. It allows you to decide when to transition gears using the paddles mounted to the steering wheel, but without having to manage the clutch pedal and shift stick. Plus, this car comes with all-wheel drive, boosting handling performance on wet or dry pavement."
