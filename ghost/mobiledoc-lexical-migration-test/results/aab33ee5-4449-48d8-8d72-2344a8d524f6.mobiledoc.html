<hr>
<p>After decades trapped in a New York parking garage, <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">the legendary Lost Corvettes</a> have resurfaced. Now, it's your chance to own one of these rare machines, and it'll only cost you the price of a raffle ticket.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">This beautiful 1956 Corvette</a> is one of just 290 cars painted in Cascade Green. That's fewer than ten percent of the total production run of 3,467.</p>

<p>1956 marked the first year that <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">Corvettes</a> featured a V8 as the base engine, replacing the original "Blue Flame" six cylinder. Two V8s were offered, including a 240 horsepower variant with dual carburetors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">This Corvette</a> is powered by the base 210 horsepower 265 cubic inch small block V8, fed by a single four barrel carburetor. Transmission options in 1956 were a close ratio three speed manual and a two speed Powerglide automatic.</p>
