The Baker-Rauling body works in maple and spruce with basswood top bows is in excellent condition as is the saddle interior. In 2016, this Woody was awarded the AACA 1st place Grand National Award and it also won the MAFCA Excellence for Restoration Award. It features a Tan finish with matching side curtains, a 40-horsepower 200.5-cid 4-cylinder engine mated to a 3-speed manual transmission, wide white wall tires mounted to black wire wheels."

Under the hood is a 1949 vintage 8BA flathead engine featuring Offenhauser finned heads, an intake manifold, and a pair of Stromberg 97 carburetors, mounted to a 3 speed manual transmission. A 12 volt electrical system and Juice brake system with front and rear hydraulic drum brakes adds a bit of a modern tough to an otherwise vintage masterpiece."
