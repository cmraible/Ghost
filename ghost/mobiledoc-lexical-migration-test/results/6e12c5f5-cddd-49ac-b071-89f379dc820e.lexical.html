<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11471">Rescue 22 Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to providing America’s great, wounded Veterans with the help they need in the form of life-saving service dogs. With nearly 30-percent of Global War On Terrorism Veterans returning with PTSD or Tramatic Brain Injuries and almost 1,600 with physical disabilities, the service Rescue 22 provides to those that so selflessly served this country can not be overstated. According to the organization's Executive Board Chair Angela Connor, it is <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11471">their mission</a> to “provide the highest quality task trained service dogs to our nation's combat veterans.” It is this kind of work that will help change horrifying statistics such as the 35-percent suicide rate among veterans. <br></p>

<p><a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11471">In 2015, Roush</a> set out to lift the spirits of those that were still deployed in the only way they knew how - By building a special limited edition <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11471">Mustang</a> that was only available to actively deployed military service members. Only 30 2015 2.3-liter Ecoboost Warrior T/C models were produced and all of them were made available through Military AutoSource. </p>

<p>Number nine of the 30 examples produced ended up in stock at Sisson Pre-Owned of Uniontown, Pennsylvania where it was raffled off to a Veteran, effectively raising nearly $100,000 to benefit Rescue 22. This veteran believed in the charity that the raffle benefited so much that he turned right back around and donated the car back to Sisson Pre-Owned so that it could raise more money for the charity. <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11471">This car</a> is now for sale at Carlisle Auctions’ Spring Event and all proceeds from its sale will go directly to Rescue 22 to help them help America’s Veterans.</p>
