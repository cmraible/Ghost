Michael states that he could have found a mid-engined car, such as a Toyota MR2, to base the F40 replica on, but then the proportions of the car would be wrong. The build process becomes even more fascinating when he reveals that the only tools used for fabricating the body was a hammer and a homemade metal bending machine. Originally, measurements used for this 1:1 scale Ferrari came from a model, but Michael has since had contact with the real thing to verify his work."
