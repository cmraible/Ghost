The deadsuit you occupy (who is referred to in-game as ‘Deadsuit’) is frequently troubled by her own musings as to whether she’s human, robot, mechanoid, or something else entirely. She encounters a number of humans on her journey and it’s through dialogue with them that she is constantly trying to work out what she is and why she’s there. Deadsuit’s troubled reflections on her identity are told through careful and thought-provoking dialogue which tackles identity and self-esteem; something we can all relate to. The discovery of humans also forms the main plot point; you soon realise that the few remaining humans on Lorian have set up a base camp around a crashed spaceship, and you agree to help them track down the pieces they need to repair the ship and escape the desolate moon."
