Since the game is in 2D, you have only one direction in which to flee and with no way to escape from a zombie’s grip, there’s no room for strategy or variety in combat. The homage is nice but it doesn’t pay off functionally. "

While some of the stilted diction can be chalked up to translation quirks, the substance of the story is still airheaded and banal. In the middle of a zombie apocalypse in which everything you knew is destroyed, our main character is focused on...her cheating husband. The “goal” to be reunited with the protagonist’s daughter but the majority of the dialogue revolves around this affair. There’s no sense of urgency regarding the actual situation the characters find themselves in but this D-List daytime television drama is priority. This pushes you out of the game because this isn’t how a normal person would behave. Subversion of expectations is one thing but "

What they are is bound to be polarizing however nearly every speaking character (even the one that laughably claimed to be an old lady) is a scantily clad anime-style woman with *ahem* unrealistic anatomical proportions and an overzealous use of jiggle physics. I understand that this is a title meant for a mature audience but this level of blatant fan-service feels childish and gratuitous. That being said they are well drawn (despite the sometimes choppy animation) and the backgrounds have some nice artistic touches that are worth paying attention to as they change with the area you’re in. All this culminates into a decent, albeit ridiculous, art style."
