<hr>
<p>Coming off the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/you-could-own-this-highly-custom-c4-corvette/">C4 Corvette</a>, Chevrolet could've done just about anything to make the fifth-gen Corvette look good, but as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/corvette-racing-success-started-with-c5-r-001/">C5</a> ages and subsequent designs get edgier and sportier, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-chip-foose-work-on-his-1969-chevy-camaro-restomod/">Chip Foose</a> works his magic to breathe some life into this car's design. Instead of trying to reimagine what a production C5 could have looked like back in 1997, he instead gives the car a custom makeover.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7R5vb51_bUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>
<p>Aside from the mechanicals, Foose doesn't seem to be too fond of this Corvette's design as he called it "soft," "doughy" and "lazy" with a "heavy rear end," but as he points out, though, today's designers have a lot of "hand holding." For him, that isn't the case with designing a custom car since he says there are no rules in customizing a car. To get started, he creates a loose sketch of his idea, and while this is just a single rendering, he says that he would normally draw a large number of sketches to come up with various options if he were doing a custom design for a client.</p>
<p>The nose of the C5 stays about the same as its production design, but Foose adds different side vents in the front and rear fenders as well as a wraparound windshield with dual roll bars and matching dual rear wings. Foose alters the rear end to reveal more of a bullet-shaped design, and the car is given a sportier stance that still has real-world driving in mind.</p>
<p>Once he finalizes his idea, he then transfers it to another sheet and then adds color and definition to come up with his final product. If you watched <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-redesigns-the-first-gen-ford-bronco/">Foose redesign the first-gen Bronco</a>, his vision for the C5 Corvette is arguably far better. In addition to seeing Foose's idea for the fifth-gen 'Vette, he also gives his thoughts on the mid-engine <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-a-2020-c8-in-honor-of-corvette-legend-chip-miller/">C8 Corvette</a>.</p>
