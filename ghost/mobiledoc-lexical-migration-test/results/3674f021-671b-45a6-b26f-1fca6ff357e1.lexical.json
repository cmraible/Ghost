This topic has been debated here and there on the internet for some time. Now a case out of Arizona where a man was arrested for wearing his full-face motorcycle helmet through a Walmart has put the topic front and center. It’s definitely an interesting situation, especially when in 2021 obscuring your face in public has been not only acceptable but actually encouraged by all kinds of businesses for over a year. Nobody knows how long that encouragement will last, but in the future this case might set a legal precedent which affects all motorcycle riders.",

The 22-year-old also kept his camouflage backpack on and had music playing over Bluetooth, which he said was the reason he didn’t hear a manager ask him to remove his helmet at about 1:52 in the video. That manager finally called the police, who hurried to the store no doubt in part because a fatal mass shooting took place at another Walmart just days before.",

However, many businesses, including most if not all banks, have posted at their entrance rules about not wearing helmets with visors, dark sunglasses, and even baseball caps while inside. The sad fact is robbers have used helmets to obscure their identity while robbing a business or shoplifting. Even if you have a modular helmet, your best bet is to completely remove it before entering. That might seem inconvenient, but it can save you a lot of grief. After all, businesses do have the right to ask you to leave if you don’t comply with reasonable requests and the police can cite you for trespass if you don’t.
