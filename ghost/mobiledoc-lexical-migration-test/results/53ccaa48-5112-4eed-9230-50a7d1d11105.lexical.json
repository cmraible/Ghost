However with the success of the Switch, the system has received an influx of third party titles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Switch was still referred to as the NX, third party companies weren’t sure whether to support the system as the Wii U was such a commercial failure. That being said, the Switch has certainly proven itself to be a successful console and developers are taking notice. So we thought that a list of all the third party titles that we would like to see on the Switch would be fitting as a lot of rumours are beginning to surface.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So without further ado, here are 16 third party games we would like to see on the Nintendo Switch…</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fallout 4</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Fallout 4 - Launch Trailer\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5aJfebzkrM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bethesda have shown unwavering support on the Switch and their games have featured frequently in the Nintendo eShop’s Best Sellers lists. With Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Doom and Wolfenstein 2: A New Colossus (soon to be released), we think that the Fallout franchise would be a perfect fit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may argue that the Switch might not be powerful enough to support a current gen open world game, however Bethesda are masters of optimization and we believe that the payout would be well worth the effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That and the possibility of a Vault Boy Amiibo makes us truly excited.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortnite/PlayerUnknown’s Battleground</span></h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1671\" style=\"width: 1216px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1671\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1671\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fortnite-vs-pubg-Credit-CNET.jpg?resize=900%2C450\" alt=\"Third party fortnite-vs-pubg\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fortnite-vs-pubg-Credit-CNET.jpg?w=1206&amp;ssl=1 1206w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fortnite-vs-pubg-Credit-CNET.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fortnite-vs-pubg-Credit-CNET.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fortnite-vs-pubg-Credit-CNET.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit CNET</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Battle royale games have quickly taken the video game community by storm.

However as soon as that game was announced, everybody expected another announcement of the first instalment, but it never came.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">South Park: The Stick of truth actually feels like a better fit on the Switch as turn-based RPGs are such grindy games so taking them on the go just makes sense. That and it is a great way to resell the first game at full price. Now if Ubisoft are to release it after the sequel, full price won&#8217;t be easy to justify.</span></p>\n<p>Ubisoft is one of the most devoted third party company for Nintendo and The Stick of Truth just seems like an obvious port, so why not?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sims 4</span></h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1674\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1674\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1674\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Sims-4-Credit-Electronic-Arts.jpg?resize=900%2C473\" alt=\"Third Party The Sims 4\" width=\"900\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Sims-4-Credit-Electronic-Arts.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Sims-4-Credit-Electronic-Arts.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Sims-4-Credit-Electronic-Arts.jpg?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Sims-4-Credit-Electronic-Arts.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1674\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit Electronic Arts</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sims phenomenon has been a best seller for decades and is no stranger to console ports, despite being predominantly played on PC. That being said, the latest instalment, The Sims 4, has recently received a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release and we feel as though the Switch release is right around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Switch port of The Sims 4 could also feature some exclusive handheld touchscreen features and even HD Rumble. Imagine as your Sim washes their hands you feel the running water through your Joy-Cons? Or trapping your sim in a doorless room and setting them on fi… uhh, maybe not.</span></p>\n<p>The only downside is EA has not been very convincing of their third party support for the Switch, but they can&#8217;t continue to ignore the recent success of the Switch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Witness</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Witness - Release Date Trailer | PS4\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ytwNUMdbcE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This title is a gorgeous puzzle game that is perfect to play in bite-sized chunks. Every puzzle game seems like a perfect fit on the Switch as you could solve each puzzle on the odd bus ride to work, school, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, Thekla Inc. are made up of a very small team, but the work for a Switch port could always be palmed off to another studio. Our fingers remain crossed.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is Strange</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Life is Strange E3 2015 trailer (PEGI)\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vL5JIwyqjM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visual tell-tale style video games are a perfect fit for the Switch, appealing to those who wish to turn off all of the lights and emerge themselves in the story or to those who would like to watch it in short bursts on their commute to their daily commitments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is Strange is a wonderfully moving game that has captured many hearts. It isn&#8217;t a graphically intense game, so running it on the Switch shouldn&#8217;t be an issue. It is also developed and published by Square Enix who have stated that they are committed to supporting the Switch.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball FighterZ</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"DRAGON BALL FighterZ - Launch Trailer | PS4, X1, PC\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnyUyug0li8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fighter is the closest recreation to the anime that we have ever seen and was certainly a victim to the classic “why not Switch?” comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may argue that the game is too graphically intensive for the Switch, but fighting games usually don&#8217;t require too much horsepower. The main issue would be whether Nintendo’s current online service could keep up, as we all know how frustrating lag can be in precision based fighters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball games are no strangers to Nintendo consoles, and it was recently reported that </span><a href=\"https://mynintendonews.com/2018/02/10/japan-dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-on-switch-has-now-outsold-the-ps4-version/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has already outsold the PS4 version</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That being said, the development for Dragon Ball FighterZ had most likely began well before the NX dev kits were sent out, so a potential port is most likely on the way some time in the future.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overwatch</span></h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1675\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1675\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1675\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Third Party Overwatch\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?resize=1300%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Overwatch-Credit-Blizzard.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1675\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit Blizzard</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blizzard’s newest phenomenon features a much brighter art style that seems to fit right at home on a Nintendo platform.

I mean, this game was initially released five years ago and it is still as popular as ever. That&#8217;s insane!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rockstar haven&#8217;t played nice with Nintendo in past, but the Switch did receive a port of <em>LA Noire</em> within the console&#8217;s first year, so it&#8217;s not impossible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game also wouldn&#8217;t be held back by technical limitations as the game was initially released on the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 generation. It would just have to be uniquely optimised for the Switch’s hardware.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Fantasy XV</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Final Fantasy XV - Omen Trailer (North America)\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZymd6r4wGg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Final Fantasy series first begun on the Famicom in 1987 and was synonymous with Nintendo all the way up until </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Fantasy VI</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But then, something terrible happened. Square Soft had shifted development of their main Final Fantasy entries onto the original PlayStation and Nintendo hasn&#8217;t seen a new mainline Final Fantasy game since (aside from remakes of the first four games on handheld consoles).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been hints of Final Fantasy XV coming to the Switch. At a Twitch event, a developer said that they are looking to bring it to a console that rhymes with “Twitch” &#8211; hmm, a real brain teaser that one is. That being said, the Switch may not get the full version release and might receive the mobile Pocket Edition instead. But either way, Final Fantasy XV may already be planned for the Switch.</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Final Fantasy XV port to Nintendo Switch rumored by Square Enix during Gamescom Twitch Event\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMiN00RCu8c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom Hearts 3</span></h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1680\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1680\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1680\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingdom-Hearts-3-Credit-Fan-Fest.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Third Party Kingdom Hearts 3\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingdom-Hearts-3-Credit-Fan-Fest.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingdom-Hearts-3-Credit-Fan-Fest.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingdom-Hearts-3-Credit-Fan-Fest.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingdom-Hearts-3-Credit-Fan-Fest.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit Square Enix</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What? We never said the game had to be out yet to be on this list. Kingdom Hearts is another series that is no stranger to being on Nintendo systems. As stated before, Square Enix are dedicated to supporting the Switch and the Kingdom Hearts franchise has been on many different consoles despite being most commonly associated with Sony’s PlayStation consoles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingdom Hearts 3 is also developed in Unreal Engine 4 which the Nintendo Switch is specialised in supporting. However, the game has been in development for a long time so delaying it further to see a simultaneous Switch release doesn’t seem like a wise business move. If Kingdom Hearts 3 was to come to the Switch, we can see it being a similar story to Final Fantasy XV and Dragon Quest XI where Square Enix looks into porting it to the Switch at a much later date.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diablo 3</span></h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Diablo III Opening Cinematic\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9mUe5vHYzs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo systems haven’t seen a Blizzard game since Starcraft 64 on the Nintendo 64 that released almost 18 years ago, so they&#8217;re not a big third party developer for Nintendo.
