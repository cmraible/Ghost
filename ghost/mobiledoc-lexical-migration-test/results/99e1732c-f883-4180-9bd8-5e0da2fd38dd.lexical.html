<p>After an almost 20-year production run, the 1989 model year marked the end of the road for the iconic Mercedes-Benz SL's R107 body style. This car was produced from 1971 until 1989, and it was major status symbol throughout most of the '80s. What you see here is a <a href="https://www.jpfrazier.com/vehicles/253/1989-mercedes-benz-560sl?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">1989 Mercedes-Benz 560SL</a> that is likely to be one of the finest SL roadsters you're likely to find, and it's up for sale through <a href="https://www.jpfrazier.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Frazier Motorcar Company</a>.</p>

<p>With just a single owner and less than 32,000 miles on the odometer, this 560SL is as immaculate as you might expect, but the paint is the coolest part about this car. While many of these cars are red, black or silver, this 560SL is painted in a Midnight Blue paint job that is absolutely flawless â€“ no fading, scratches, door dings or rock chips. That includes the matching removable hard top, and the blue soft top is in great shape as well. This exterior is perfectly complemented by an all-gray interior that's in as excellent of a condition as the rest of the car.</p>
<p>The 560SL packed the largest and most powerful engine that the SL lineup ever offered in the U.S. with a 5.5-liter V8 that produced 227 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque. Not only does this engine make the 560SL a perfect vehicle to cruise around in, it will also keep other sports cars honest as it has plenty of get up and go. As you might expect from a car with just one owner and such low mileage, this Mercedes is in near-original condition, and it has been properly maintained over the years with a list of new components to ensure this Mercedes will remain a confident cruiser.</p>
