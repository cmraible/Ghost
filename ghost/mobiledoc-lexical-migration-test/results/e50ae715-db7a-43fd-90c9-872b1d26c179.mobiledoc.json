Was it dull and you just want to give it a lift? Captain Toad Treasure Tracker is a bright and colourful game that oozes joy and charm. The game isn’t a control-hectic game as Captain Toad cannot jump due to the weight of his backpack. So feel free to kickback and explore every nook and cranny with the adorable Toad and Toadette. Sure you may have some boss fights and a few tight levels, but the charm simply overcomes that and brings out some relaxing vibes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Donut County</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"DONUT COUNTY | Duality of Holes [Switch Launch Trailer]\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_t_Ns_aAuzI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developed By </strong>Ben Esposito<br><strong>Published By </strong>Annapurna Interactive<br><strong>Genre </strong>Puzzle / Adventure<br><strong>Rating </strong>E<br><strong>Players </strong>1</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donut County is a wacky game with an even wackier concept.

Gorogoa is all about guiding a boy through works of art as you zoom in, zoom out and move frames around a 2&#215;2 grid. The beauty of Gorogoa is how fresh of an experience it is.

The art, the music, the fluidity of the controls, it all blends together in the most beautiful way imaginable. Developer Nomada Studio and publisher Devolver Digital recommend playing GRIS with headphones on in order to be fully immersed in the experience and we couldn’t agree more. There are so many subtleties with the sound design, like the trickling of water and the shifting of stones coupled together with the accurate HD Rumble, that will make all of your worries drift away. There is also no way to die in GRIS, nor are there enemies and combat, you’ll just be solving platform puzzles as you marvel at the game’s majesty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about GRIS, <a href=\"https://switchaboo.com/2018/12/13/gris-review-switch/\">click here to read our review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hook</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"&quot;Hook&quot;\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKaJZ0I_A4Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developed By</strong> Rainbow Train<br><strong>Published By</strong> Rainbow Train<br><strong>Rating</strong> E<br><strong>Players</strong> 1</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hook is a very simple puzzle game that requires you to retract all of the lines to complete a level. However, this is easier said than done. The lines must be retracted in specific orders as one line&#8217;s path may be blocked by another. The game starts off easy, but quickly becomes a head-scratching brain-twister as the levels become more complex. Despite all that, the game&#8217;s calming ambience makes it a perfect activity under a tree on a nice sunny day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about Hook, <a href=\"https://switchaboo.com/2019/03/31/hook-switch-review/\">click here to read our review.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Official Game Trailer - Nintendo E3 2016\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rPxiXXxftE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developed By </strong>Nintendo<br><strong>Published By </strong>Nintendo<br><strong>Genre </strong>Adventure / Action / RPG<br><strong>Rating </strong>E10+<br><strong>Players </strong>1</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may find it a little strange that we’ve put an open-world action adventure game on this list, but hear us out. Sure, BOTW can be a combat heavy game at times, but you can also just as easily explore the world at your own leisure, collect a few korok seeds and use your paraglider to soar over a world that presents a ridiculous amount of possibilities. Sink 10 minutes in and explore an enticing-looking mountain or stay up until 4am finding shrines and solving puzzles; BOTW allows you to explore the world at YOUR own pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n[su_button url=&#8221;https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01MS6MO77/ref=sr_1_2?crid=310RLY251WRAC&#038;keywords=nintendo+switch+breath+of+the+wild&#038;qid=1565319196&#038;s=gateway&#038;sprefix=breath+of+switch%2Caps%2C1070&#038;sr=8-2&#8243; target=&#8221;blank&#8221; style=&#8221;3d&#8221; background=&#8221;#2a17b3&#8243; size=&#8221;8&#8243; center=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_shadow=&#8221;0px 0px 0px #000000&#8243;]Buy The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild from Amazon[/su_button]\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>My Time at Portia</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"My Time At Portia - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7KE_uWZ9UY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developed By </strong>Pathea Games<br><strong>Published By </strong>Team17<br><strong>Genre </strong>RPG / Simulation / Adventure<br><strong>Rating </strong>E10+<br><strong>Players </strong>1</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Time at Portia is a vastly open life simulation game that takes inspiration from classic games of the like.

But it’s not just about the plot; getting to know the characters, what makes them tick and what makes them anxious, fleshes out the story and makes them relatable.

If you do it with some friends or with your family, it can also be an amazing way to bond. Nintendo Labo takes video games into an entirely new direction and its interactive nature takes you back to school in arts and crafts classes. And when you finally catch that first fish with the fishing rod that you built, or release some steam by smashing some buildings with your very own creation on your back, you’re bound to feel a sense of personal achievement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n[su_button url=&#8221;https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Labo-Variety-Kit-Switch/dp/B01MY7GL3O/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Nintendo%2BLabo&#038;qid=1565352412&#038;s=gateway&#038;sr=8-3&#038;th=1&#8243; target=&#8221;blank&#8221; style=&#8221;3d&#8221; background=&#8221;#2a17b3&#8243; size=&#8221;8&#8243; center=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_shadow=&#8221;0px 0px 0px #000000&#8243;]Buy Nintendo Labo &#8211; Variety Kit from Amazon[/su_button]\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n[su_button url=&#8221;https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Labo-Robot-Kit-Switch/dp/B01N4N8NAL/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Nintendo+Labo&#038;qid=1565352521&#038;s=gateway&#038;sr=8-5&#8243; target=&#8221;blank&#8221; style=&#8221;3d&#8221; background=&#8221;#2a17b3&#8243; size=&#8221;8&#8243; center=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_shadow=&#8221;0px 0px 0px #000000&#8243;]Buy Nintendo Labo &#8211; Robot Kit from Amazon[/su_button]\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n[su_button url=&#8221;https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Labo-Toy-03-Vehicle-Switch/dp/B07FYN3JDL/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=Nintendo+Labo&#038;qid=1565352521&#038;s=gateway&#038;sr=8-7&#8243; target=&#8221;blank&#8221; style=&#8221;3d&#8221; background=&#8221;#2a17b3&#8243; size=&#8221;8&#8243; center=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_shadow=&#8221;0px 0px 0px #000000&#8243;]Buy Nintendo Labo &#8211; Vehicle Kit from Amazon[/su_button]\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n[su_button url=&#8221;https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Labo-Toy-04-Starter-Blaster/dp/B07PK5MYPR/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Nintendo+Labo&#038;qid=1565352521&#038;s=gateway&#038;sr=8-4&#8243; target=&#8221;blank&#8221; style=&#8221;3d&#8221; background=&#8221;#2a17b3&#8243; size=&#8221;8&#8243; center=&#8221;yes&#8221; text_shadow=&#8221;0px 0px 0px #000000&#8243;]Buy Nintendo Labo &#8211; VR Kit from Amazon[/su_button]\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Picross S</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"PICROSS S Trailer (Nintendo Switch)\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqdG2w4AW8A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Published By </strong>Jupiter Corporation<br><strong>Genre </strong>Puzzle<br><strong>Rating </strong>E<br><strong>Players </strong>1 &#8211; 2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it’s good to kick back with a puzzle.

Just think, works been tough, you’re on your break and you want to focus on something else, so take out your switch and solve a picross puzzle or two… or seven.
