<hr>
<p>The mid to late 1980s was a rough time period for the automobile. Regulations in most markets were strangling and even the luxury car market was not immune to the effects. In an effort to overcome these trying times in automotive history, Mercedes-Benz expanded its line of <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1989-mercedes-benz-560sl-garnet">SL-Class</a> cars for the American market. The result was the 5.6-liter V8 powered <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1989-mercedes-benz-560sl-garnet">560SL</a>.</p>

<p>Introduced to the market in 1986, <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1989-mercedes-benz-560sl-garnet">the 560SL</a> is still considered an icon among enthusiasts today. Its subdued understated elegance mixed with the most powerful V8 option for the SL-Class at the time, made it one of the most commercially successful Mercedes vehicles up to that point. The most desirable of the four year model was its last year. In 1989, the 560SL stood for the best that Mercedes-Benz had to offer and for many enthusiasts, this is a sentiment that still rings true today. With less than 6,000 examples being produced, a clean low-mileage example from 1989 is hard to find. Especially <a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1989-mercedes-benz-560sl-garnet">one in a rare color</a> like Garnet Red Poly, which was a single year shade. That is what makes this example being offered by Farland Classic Restoration so special.</p>

<p><a href="https://farlandcars.com/cars/1989-mercedes-benz-560sl-garnet">This 1989 560SL</a> is an all-original Mercedes collectorâ€™s dream. It features the rarely-seen rear seat option and appears to be barely used. There are only around 14,000 original miles on this car and it is cosmetically and mechanically sound. While it may look like it, this 560SL has never been restored. The paint, soft Mushroom leather interior, and legendary drive train is in as close to new condition as can be expected with a 32-year old car. This is an incredible opportunity to add this iconic Mercedes-Benz to your collection.
