<hr>
<p>Car thieves are having fun going shopping in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Australia where luxury cars abound. According to police, crime gangs are paying teens and young adults to boost the vehicles, which then are used to commit all sorts of violent crimes, including murders. We see this sort of thing here in the US as well as in Canada, the UK, and pretty much everywhere else. However, the problem seems to be especially bad in the Sydney area.</p>

<p>So far, police have recovered 43 stolen luxury vehicles cops have termed the “killer fleet.” But it’s an arms race as thieves just take more to replace what’s been taken by police. Cops are looking for 5 particular cars they believe may be used soon to commit serious violent crimes.</p>

<p>Fueling this demand for luxury cars is a growing feud between two crime families. Police say they’re often used as getaway vehicles. Now law enforcement is reaching out to the public for help in tracking down the 5 cars featured in the graphic.</p>
<p>You’ll notice in the video report out of Australia what they consider to be luxury cars isn’t always what we would term a luxury vehicle. For example, the police recovered an S550 Mustang, which might be a nice car here but isn’t a BMW E-Class. Just keep in mind in Australia a Mustang is foreign and fairly rare, plus vehicles cost significantly more there. Also, the Aussie auto market has been flooded not only by cheap Korean brands like Kia and Hyundai, but even cheaper Chinese brands. We actually really feel for them because of all that, especially since there used to be some really cool cars made Down Under.</p>

<p>Of course, there are still quite a few Mercedes, Range Rovers, and other rides Americans would consider flashy being used by criminals. These guys like to roll around in something expensive and reasonable fast, they just don’t like paying for it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpeQkICX_dY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
