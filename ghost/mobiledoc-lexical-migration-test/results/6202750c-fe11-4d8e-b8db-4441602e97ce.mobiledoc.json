There's a reason why this car requires such a high price, Callaway has made a name for itself through immeasurable achievement in the world of vehicle production. They are virtually world-renowned for their Corvettes and Camaros as some of the most powerful and insane cars available on the modified vehicle market. This praise even goes so far as to say that they are one of the most recognizable companies in the industry. Callaway has made some truly amazing developments in the car-world and will surely continue its legacy built upon performance and raw power for many years to come."
