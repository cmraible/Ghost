However there was a pretty cool looking Chevrolet Bel Air sedan which stands out as one of the most popular older models in modern car culture. Overall, the best vehicle in the entire lot has got to be the immaculate riding lawn mower whose beauty has been retained despite its age. All jokes aside, it’s a great collection of cars that the owner is selling for a whopping $1 million which may spell a new chance for these classics to get back on the road once again someday.",
