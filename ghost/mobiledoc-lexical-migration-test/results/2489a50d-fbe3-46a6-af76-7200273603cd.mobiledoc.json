This one of the 31 out of the prestigious 39 lots sold during the auction. Another highlight was a world record-breaking sale of a 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ, selling for £1,181,250 ($1.35 million), making it the highest-priced Giulia ever sold.  Each lot was hand curated and vetted before coming under the hammer."
