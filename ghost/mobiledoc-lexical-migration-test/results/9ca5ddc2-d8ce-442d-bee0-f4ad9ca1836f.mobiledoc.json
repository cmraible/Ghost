In the video, he puts the number at 396. Really, the point is not many of these were made, so you don’t see them listed on Facebook Marketplace constantly."

          "You might think with their rarity a lot of people would be excited to see a ‘69 Dodge Charger 500. Well, some are, but some think they’re trash. That’s right, these things are controversial. It all goes back to their creation. As homologation vehicles, they were created for NASCAR compliance. In the late 1960s Dodge realized it had a high-speed stability problem so it sought to make the Charger more aerodynamic. The first full-fledged attempt at this was the Charger 500."

          "Before the Charger 500 program was fully realized, Dodge pulled the plug. The cars weren’t as competitive in NASCAR as hoped, and Dodge didn’t think massaging the design further would yield the necessary results. Some claim 500 units, the minimum required for homologation, were completed by the factory. Others say it was about 100 or more fewer than that. Most experts agree on 392 completed. Considering all the build records weren’t kept in a digital database back then, these sorts of disagreements about production numbers are pretty common."
