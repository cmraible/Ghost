It should be noted, however, that when he wanted to build a sports car of his own, he looked to America for a bulletproof powerplant.</p>

This one is especially unique, though, due to its <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0034-1968-iso-grifo-gl-series-i-by-bertone/820714?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">unusual Pavesi sunroof</a>. The two removable panels are somewhat like a hybrid between a T-top, a targa, and a sunroof. Only six Grifos were built this way.</p>
<p>While it was originally painted white, we think this car looks terrific <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/el20/the-elkhart-collection/lots/r0034-1968-iso-grifo-gl-series-i-by-bertone/820714?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">in yellow</a>. Some folks think that all Italian sports cars should be red. We say that if an Italian car looks good in red, it will look even better in yellow.</p>
