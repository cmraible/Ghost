<p>Good things are happening! For the first time in U.S. history, voters made affordable health care a state constitutional right. Meanwhile, Arizona voters are passing ballot measures to fight dark money and expand academic assistance. Also, a city in Ohio is eliminating millions in medical debt and San Franciscans score a win for housing justice.</p>

<h3 id="oregon-enshrines-the-right-to-health-care">Oregon Enshrines The Right To Health Care</h3>
<p>On Monday, Oregon voters <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/11/15/oregon-election-right-to-affordable-health-care/">passed</a><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_111,_Right_to_Healthcare_Amendment_(2022)">Measure 111</a>, making affordable health care a fundamental human right. It is the first state in the country to change its constitution in order to enshrine the right to health care. The measure states: ‚ÄúIt is the obligation of the state to ensure that every resident of Oregon has access to cost-effective, clinically appropriate and affordable health care as a fundamental right.‚Äù</p>
<p>By including the right to affordable health care in its constitution, Oregon would be given more <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/10/17/oregon-measure-111-what-does-it-mean-health-care-fundamental-right-state-constitution/">authority</a> to address rising health care costs and prevent the legislature from cutting current recipients from Medicaid, including undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Passing Measure 111 and securing the constitutional right to health care was a <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/11/08/oregon-election-measure-111-right-to-access-affordable-health-care/">lifelong</a> goal of Portland Democrat Mitch Greenlick, who served in the state‚Äôs legislature and attempted at least <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/05/19/oregon-health-care-constitutional-right/">eight times</a> in 16 years to bring such a proposal before voters. Greenlick passed away in 2020, after advocating the proposal in that year‚Äôs legislative session.</p>
<h3 id="a-rare-win-against-dark-money">A Rare Win Against Dark Money</h3><!--members-only-->
<p>Arizona Proposition 211, a measure to fight dark money influencing elections, won with <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/11/09/arizona-voters-unite-prop-211-demand-dark-money-disclosure/8313548001/">overwhelming support</a>, earning more than 70 percent of all votes.</p>
<p>Known as the Voters‚Äô Right to Know Act, the measure <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-rare-win-in-the-fight-against-dark-money">requires</a> dark money nonprofits spending more than $50,000 dollars on any combination of state campaigns and ballot measures to publicly disclose the names of any donors giving more than $5,000 dollars. For local races, groups spending more than $25,000 will have to disclose their donors.</p>
<p>It took <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2022/11/09/arizona-voters-unite-prop-211-demand-dark-money-disclosure/8313548001/">six years</a> for the dark money-fighting measure to get on the ballot. In order to guarantee transparency, the new requirement applies even if a contribution is routed through a front group or shell organization attempting to shield the identity of the original donor.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEveryone knows [shell organizations are] just a cover and they resent it. But without this, there‚Äôs no way to get the truth,‚Äù Terry Goddard, Arizona‚Äôs former attorney general who backed the ballot measure, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-rare-win-in-the-fight-against-dark-money">told</a><em>The New Yorker.</em></p>
<h3 id="arizona-expands-financial-assistance-to-undocumented-students">Arizona Expands Financial Assistance To Undocumented Students</h3>
<p>Arizona voters passed <a href="https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/prop_308_ballot_format_language.pdf">Proposition 308</a>, granting academic financial aid to all students regardless of immigration status. Proposition 308 will <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/democracy/2022/11/08/immigration-nonprofits-undocumented-dreamers">repeal</a> the effects of a 2006 state measure that made undocumented people and students ineligible for certain state-subsidized benefits, such as in-state tuition and financial aid.</p>
<p>Arizona will now join <a href="https://www.nilc.org/issues/education/basic-facts-instate/">23 other states</a> in which undocumented students and those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status ‚Äî also known as <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/democracy/2022/11/08/immigration-nonprofits-undocumented-dreamers">‚ÄúDreamers‚Äù</a> ‚Äî can receive in-state tuition and financial aid at community colleges and state universities.</p>

<p>Every year, an estimated 3,600 undocumented Arizona high school students or more could benefit from academic assistance.</p>
<h3 id="toledo-torpedoes-medical-debt">Toledo Torpedoes Medical Debt</h3>
<p>In a creative use of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, Toledo‚Äôs city council <a href="https://www.13abc.com/2022/11/09/toledo-city-council-approves-medical-debt-relief-legislation/">approved legislation</a> to use some of the city‚Äôs COVID-related stimulus funds to relieve residents of millions of dollars worth of medical debt. By partnering with the non-profit organization <a href="https://ripmedicaldebt.org/">RIP Medical Debt</a>, which buys debt bundles from hospitals at a discount, Toledo and Lucas County Residents will use $1.6 million to eliminate as much as $200 million in medical debt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of our model, and the way medical debt is bought and sold in the U.S., we‚Äôre positioned to stretch government funds even farther,‚Äù RIP Medical Debt president and CEO Allison Sesso said in a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20221115988/ohio-city-and-county-plan-to-wipe-out-up-to-240-million-in-residents-medical-debt-using-16-million-in-federal-stimulus-money">statement</a>. ‚ÄúOne dollar into the program abolishes on average $100 of medical debt.‚Äù</p>
<p>Councilwoman Michele Grim spearheaded the measure and <a href="https://www.13abc.com/2022/11/09/toledo-city-council-approves-medical-debt-relief-legislation/">said</a> it would use less than 1 percent of the city‚Äôs ARPA funds to wipe out decades of debt.</p>
<h3 id="a-step-for-housing-justice">A Step For Housing Justice</h3>
<p>San Franciscans backed Proposition M ‚Äî <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/san-francisco-voters-vacancy-tax-17584082.php">the Empty Homes Tax</a> ‚Äî in an effort to stop landlords from sitting on vacant housing units and protecting sky-high rents. While <a href="https://sfstandard.com/housing-development/will-a-vacancy-tax-make-a-dent-in-sfs-housing-market-not-really-say-analysts/">failing</a> to tackle all 40,000 empty units in the city caused by <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11930303/should-sf-and-berkeley-tax-empty-homes-following-oaklands-lead">real estate speculation</a>, the San Francisco Controller‚Äôs Office estimates that the tax will apply to 4,000 units, raising as much as <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/11/what-approved-election-measures-mean-for-housing/">$20 million</a> for a city affordable housing fund in its first year alone.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that people are fed up with tens of thousands of homes sitting vacant while thousands of people are sleeping on the streets,‚Äù San Francisco District 5 Supervisor Dean Preston, who spearheaded the measure, wrote in a <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/san-francisco-voters-vacancy-tax-17584082.php#:~:text=Starting%20on%20Jan.%201%2C%202024,as%20%2420%2C000%20per%20empty%20unit.">statement</a>. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud that San Francisco will soon become the third city in the nation to seriously address vacant units through this progressive tax measure, and that the millions of dollars of revenue will go to rental subsidies for low-income seniors and more affordable housing.‚Äù</p>
