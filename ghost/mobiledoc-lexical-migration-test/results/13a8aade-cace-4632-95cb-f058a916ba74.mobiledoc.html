<hr>
<p><a href="https://americasautomotivetrust.tapkat.org/winasaleen302mustang?promo=MOTORIOUS3">Saleen</a> has been building its version of the ultimate Mustang since the mid 1980’s and is currently producing one of the most powerful Mustangs ever built. <a href="https://americasautomotivetrust.tapkat.org/winasaleen302mustang?promo=MOTORIOUS3">The S302 Black Label</a> features an 800-horsepower supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine paired with a 6-speed manual transmission and a full Racecraft suspension. Other upgrades include a set of 20-inch Saleen wheels, a special oil cooler and a tuned 3-inch exhaust system.</p>

<p>As is the case with most highly sought after high-performance vehicles, production of the <a href="https://americasautomotivetrust.tapkat.org/winasaleen302mustang?promo=MOTORIOUS3">S302 Black Label</a> is limited and for the majority of people, getting the opportunity to purchase one of these cars is probably just a pipe dream but now anyone can win one thanks to this America’s Automotive Trust raffle. But this is not just any 2019 Saleen Mustang S302 Black Label. This is “Blazing Fury,” the one-off example that was customized and signed by legendary high-performance vehicle manufacturer Steve Saleen himself.</p>
