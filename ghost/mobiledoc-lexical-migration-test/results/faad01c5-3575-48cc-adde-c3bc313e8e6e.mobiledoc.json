The ad is supposed to get you excited for the 2022 Toyota GR86, what you might have known before as simply the Toyota 86 or the Scion FR-S. However, the commercial exposes one of the many things wrong with modern automakers, whether that was part of the point or not. It’s actually rather genius and something I watched multiple times while sending to other people so they could enjoy a good laugh."

It features the same two people from Toyota Gazoo Racing pitching a commercial idea for the sports car to two “suits” or Toyota executives. The executives seem to think the GR people are pitching gimmicky, cheap ideas when what they’re trying to sell in the commercial is excitement and fun. Those are the reasons people buy performance vehicles, which is why it’s so hilarious when automakers try to portray rather pedestrian, boring vehicles like the Hyundai Elantra in that light."

One is boring and focuses on the practical features of the sports car, while the other shows it racing through an abandoned shopping mall."

          "Toyota certainly has been guilty of being a little too uptight in the past two decades or so. The company gets beat up for that a lot, with many enthusiasts sadly just mouthing what automotive sites and magazines have told them to think about the brand. However, they’re hardly the only ones in this industry guilty of being out of touch with what the people want."

Sure, they might put a performance veneer on what’s coming, but in a way that’s more insulting than just admitting they’re watering their muscle cars, trucks, and off-roaders down for socio-political reasons. That’s just one example of so many more."

          "The point of this isn’t to pick on just one brand, because this is an industry-wide problem. Most enthusiasts don’t pay attention, but automakers are pretty incestuous, their executives and other high-level employees moving from one to another like hummingbirds visiting flowers on a spring morning. This is in part why it seems like automakers are all doing pretty much the same thing, even though most people aren’t asking for it. Sure, the companies say they’re just meeting market demand, but what’s really going on is automakers don’t really, truly have to care what you want if they all act in lockstep. After all, the auto industry has become an oligopoly in the past few decades. Less competition means consumers are pretty much forced to consume whatever the limited producers put in front of them."

There are absolutely things which could be done about this problem, but it would involve changes those controlling things right now won’t like, even powers outside the auto industry. And that’s where the true problem really lies."
