<p>BMW never officially made an M8 version of its E31 8 Series, but the high-powered 850CSi was just as good. According to the listing for this <a href="https://rapleyclassiccars.com/product/1994-bmw-850csi-2/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1994 BMW 850CSi</a>, only 225 examples of the range-topping 850CSi were built for the U.S. market, and of those, one of only 26 painted in Hellrot red. That makes this 850CSi being sold through <a href="https://rapleyclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Rapley Classic Cars</a> a true unicorn for BMW fanatics.</p>

<p>Coming into the “golden era” of the SCCAs Trans-American Championship racing series, auto manufacturers and racers alike went to great extents to dominate the track. Pontiac was no exception. Going as far as to create a new engine that complied with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/buy-this-corvette-challenge-spec-series-show-car/">SCCA's</a> 5.0-liter or less guideline for use in a specially optioned <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/first-gen-pontiac-firebird/">Firebird</a> bearing the name of the series itself, Pontiacs efforts unfortunately did not pay off in the race series. However, for enthusiasts that longed for a Firebird with more power, better handling, and unmistakable style, Pontiac struck gold creating the American icon known as the Trans Am.</p>

<p>After the 1980 season, the International Race of Champions or IROC series took a break from competition until 1984.

Hailed by many as a return to form for Chevrolet <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle cars</a>, the IROC-Z is being celebrated today.
