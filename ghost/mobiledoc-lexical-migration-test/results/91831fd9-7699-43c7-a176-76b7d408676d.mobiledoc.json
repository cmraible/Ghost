The Ducati was parked on the 4th floor of a parking garage in Miami, specifically at the 1800 Club, which is at 1800 N. Bayshore Dr. Since I’m not familiar with the garage, I’m not sure if it’s secured, but that seems to be hinted at by a local news story, so that was one security obstacle the thieves had to overcome to pull this off."

On top of that, he had the Ducati Performance alarm activated. Plus, there was a GPS tracker on the motorcycle. None of that stopped the thieves."

On December 29 of 2020 some guys in a white Chevy Econoline cargo van stole a Ducati from a Miami Beach apartment complex parking garage. A local report didn’t specify the model of the bike, but said it was valued at about $20,000. While not nearly as high-end as this heist, the MO of these thieves is shockingly similar considering they hit a parking garage, stole a Ducati, used a van for the theft, and they even put a stolen license plate on the getaway vehicle. I couldn’t find any reports indicating the motorcycle had been found, so there’s a strong possibility this theft ring is either shipping them out of the country or chopping it and selling the parts."
