For many cars, this would have been the end of the line, but in fact, this design and the Avanti name were resurrected in 1965 through 1985 as the Avanti II and from 1986 through 2006 as the Avanti.

          "With just over 10,000 miles showing on the odometer, this 1985 Avanti II has to be one of the nicest and most original examples of this car left. The four-seater coupe has a sporty vibe inside with heavily bolstered bucket seats, and a dash design that carries over from the original, factory-built Avanti. The best part of the Avanti II is its throwback design that is practically identical to Studebaker's original car. This particular example has a very sinister look to it with an all-black paint job and black mesh wheels sourced from a Buick Grand National."

The Avanti's 190-horsepower was impressive for that era, but it was less than the 300-hp 327 cubic-inch V8 the Avanti II was initially built with 20 years earlier."
