While that certainly helps cut down on theft, it’s certainly no guarantee someone who doesn’t want to make a living honestly won’t still help themselves to your stuff. That’s exactly what happened in Bertrand, New Brunswick, Canada recently as some suspects broke into a warehouse, stealing two Camaros and a truck."

Whoever did the job apparently broke a window to get inside the warehouse. Sometime in the process of boosting the three vehicles, they also “significantly damaged” one of the exterior walls. Immediately what comes to mind is they hit the wall with one of the rides while maneuvering it around."
