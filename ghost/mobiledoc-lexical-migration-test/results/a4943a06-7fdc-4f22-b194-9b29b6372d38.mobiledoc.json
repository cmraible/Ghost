All V8 versions comes standard with a Shaker hood – Dodge points out this is the first time this hood has been offered on the Widebody Challenger – while the headlights even get a unique touch with \"50\" illuminated inside the Air Catcher lights. The interior adds retro-themed gauges and start-up screen, and the \"50\" is embroidered on the seats and the Berber carpeted floor mats."
