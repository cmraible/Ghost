Throughout their time, they boasted a very unique style which is unlike anything built since. It makes sense, everyone these days likes looking at cars that reflect design cues of the 1960s and ‘70s but 1950s we’re an era in design that could be regarded as a spur of the moment type idea. This particular car is a great showcase of those ideas, the only problem being it has been sitting in a barn for years.",

Everybody escaped the crash without injury but the uncle lost his liscense. From that point forward the car was sold to its current owner before hoping around the country.",

In the truck there sat a plethora of parts from a donor vehicle that proved pretty helpful but the real wonder is what’s under the hood. While the engine was t running when the couple of car people got there, they eventually got everything in order after a hard day’s work. Finally seeing this old legend back on the road once again is a beautiful sight and hopefully this is the start of a new phase of restoration in the car’s life.",
