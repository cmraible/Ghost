Sure, some of them make us want to retch into the garbage can, proving that crimes against humanity can absolutely be committed through car modifications, but others are pretty fascinating. However, we can’t quite agree on what to make of this lifted Ford Mustang."

If so, are they doing it just for kicks or do they think it gives them some sort of speed advantage? We really want to know since the post on Reddit comes with zero details."

We see truck owners commit this offense, some of them intentionally, and it just makes us sick. If you’re going to lift your vehicle big time, but some big tires on there, at least 33s, please. Instead, we have this Mustang which is like some violation of nature itself."
