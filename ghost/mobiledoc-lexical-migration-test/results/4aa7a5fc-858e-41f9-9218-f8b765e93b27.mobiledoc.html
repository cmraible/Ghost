<h3 id="if-youve-ever-dreamed-about-a-4x4-version-of-dodges-lil-red-express-this-mean-f-150-is-what-youre-looking-for">If you've ever dreamed about a 4x4 version of Dodge's Li'l Red Express, this mean F-150 is what you're looking for.</h3>
<p>We all remember Dodge's Li'l Red Express Truck from the late '70s, so it's hard not to draw comparisons with this monster <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/5020-atl/1985-ford-f-150-4x4-flareside?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">1985 Ford F-150 Flareside 4x4</a>. This big Ford has the same bright red paint job and big, chrome exhaust stacks, but while the Dodge was only two-wheel drive, this F-150 being sold by <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">Streetside Classics</a> is ready for any terrain with its lifted stance and four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>Looking like a mix between a sports car and a monster truck, this F-150 is has a 302 CID V8 sitting underneath its below the scooped hood, and the engine has been upgraded with a four-barrel carb and intake manifold from Edelbrock. The best part though is the exhaust notes this engine makes from those chrome, vertical stacks when it's fired up. The engine is backed by a strong Ford C4 three-speed automatic transmission making this truck perfect for cruising car shows or tearing up trails.</p>
<p>Other than the hood scoop and exhaust stacks, the body of this 1985 Ford F-150 Flareside 4x4 looks as good as it did the day it was built, and those 15-inch bullet hole-style wheels wearing meaty 35x12.50R15 ProComp tires give this truck a menacing stance. Getting into the truck is easy thanks to the tube side steps, and opening the doors to the cab reveals that this truck still has a mostly stock interior with the exception of an aftermarket stereo system, four-spoke Challenger Series steering wheel from Grant and billet shift levers for the transmission and transfer case. Like the body, this cabin is in great shape with no wear or stains on the cloth seats and no cracks or fading on the dash.</p>
