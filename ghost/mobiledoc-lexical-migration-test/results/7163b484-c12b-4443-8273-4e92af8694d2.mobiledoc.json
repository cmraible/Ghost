The hood is flipped up, but that might have been done after the accident since there’s no apparent damage to it. On the passenger side there’s damage to the rear fender and there’s a nice crack in the front fender. However, this crash could have had a far worse outcome. Unless there’s some hidden mechanical problems, the damage looks fairly easy to fix."

However, those are just guesses and we have no way to confirm if they’re even remotely accurate. It’s also possible this crash was caused by a mechanical fault in the car, although that’s less likely. The lesson everyone needs to come in mind is you should stay on top of vehicle maintenance and drive defensively, avoiding panicking and jerking the steering wheel should you momentarily lose control."
