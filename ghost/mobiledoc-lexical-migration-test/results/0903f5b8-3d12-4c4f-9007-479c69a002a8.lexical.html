<p>Flat Heroes is a platformer with a minimalistic art style, but the game packs in so much more than what you’d initially think.

<h3>Forma.8</h3>

<p>Being the only Metroidvania on the list, Forma.8 is a unique take on the genre. Play as Forma.8, the little exploration probe tasked with the mission to recover a powerful energy source on an alien planet. With a colorful art style and a clean presentation, Forma.8 is a rich adventure that thrives in its simplistic graphics and surprisingly deep gameplay. Forma.8 is often on sale so it’s definitely a fantastic game to consider for a steal.</p>
<h3>Freedom Planet</h3>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<p><strong>Price </strong>$14.99<br><strong>Developed By </strong>GalaxyTrail<br><strong>Published By </strong>Marvelous (XSEED)<br><strong>Genre </strong>Action / Adventure / Platformer<br><strong>Rating </strong>E10+<br><strong>Players </strong>1</p>
<p>On its initial release in 2014, 2D Sonic fans rejoiced as Freedom Planet represented a lot of what fans of the blue hedgehog were missing. However now that we’re living in a post-Sonic Mania world, that doesn’t take away everything that is unique about this hidden gem. Play as the dragon Lilac, the feline Carol and Milla the shy puppy on a quest to restore power to the Kingdom Stone that emits energy to the three kingdoms, but is beginning to weaken. The combat takes a more action/platformer approach, with a variety of attacks to dish out to your enemies. The story is deeper than you’d expect, with every single line of dialogue delivered with quality voice acting. Definitely not one to skip for Sonic fans, or simply fans of the 2D platformer genre.</p>

<p>Gyro Boss DX is a fantastic example of how a game can have such a lasting impact with such simple graphics and controls. This hidden gem is a retro inspired bullet-hell arcade game that has you circling an invading alien and dodging the projectiles that come your way. The game also comes complete with a Party Mode that pits you against your friends and family in a last man standing deathmatch.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong> $1.99 <br><strong>Developed By</strong> Rainbow Train <br><strong>Published By</strong> Rainbow Train <br><strong>Genre</strong> Puzzle<br><strong>Rating</strong> E <br><strong>Players</strong> 1 </p>
<p>Hook is a very simple puzzle game that requires you to retract all of the lines to complete a level. However, this is easier said than done. The lines must be retracted in specific orders as one line’s path may be blocked by another. The game starts off easy, but quickly becomes a head-scratching brain-twister as the levels become more complex.</p>

<p>Horizon Shift ‘81 is a love letter to classic arcade shoot ‘em ups, recreating that feeling of walking up to an arcade machine for the very first time, but with modern twists to pull it into the 21st century.

<p>Jotun: Valhalla Edition is a beautifully hand-drawn action game that immerses you in Norse mythology. Thora, a female viking warrior who has suffered an inglorious death, must prove herself to the Gods in order to enter Valhalla. Featuring nine levels filled to the brim with Viking mythology, take down ferocious Jotuns (giant Norse elementals) with Thora’s two-handed axe and powers bestowed upon her by the gods. While the game has been on many consoles (including Wii U), the game’s polish and unique premise is certainly cause for more notoriety.
