<p>Really sorry for the second email today — some of our free subscribers said they had trouble viewing <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> new video holding politicians accountable for not passing $2,000 checks.</p>
<p>If you want to watch the video we mentioned in our last email to you, <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1364323304257908736?s=20"><strong>please click here to view it</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>If that link for some reason does not work, then literally just copy and paste this link into your browser: https://bit.ly/3bAc7ia</p>
<p><strong>The video has been viewed nearly 100,000 in less than a day - if you like it, help us produce more by <a href="#/portal/signup"><strong>clicking here</strong></a> and becoming a supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
