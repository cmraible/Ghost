<p>Way back at the 1998 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/379901/prochargers-sema-dodge-challenger-stolen">SEMA Show</a>, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/Expedition">Ford Expedition</a> XLT SeaScape caused quite a few car enthusiasts to stop and shake their head in sad disbelief. After all, someone took the time to chop up the full-size SUV and make it look somewhat like a boat, and for what? It’s about on the same level as dropping an LS5 into a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> New Beetle, because there’s really no logic, even fun-bad logic to it.</p>
<p>Making the story even more bizarre, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford">Ford</a> Expedition XLT SeaScape ended up in the possession of a guy working at McDonald’s in Mississippi. Somehow that seems all too appropriate. Dough Tabbutt ran across it while on a cross-country road trip, offering to buy it on a whim. As Tabbutt explains in the video, he basically makes bad decisions to then have good car stories, and buying this Ford turned into a boat sure was a horrible decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, the story of Tabbutt trying to buy a crazy, horrible old SEMA vehicle off an elderly man restocking the soda machine at McDonald’s, after climbing out of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a>, which arrived with an <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Aston%20Martin">Aston Martin</a> is just hilarious. Other workers at the fast food restaurant are freaking out because they probably figure these out-of-towners are multi-millionaires.</p>

<p>The provenance of this truck is just as bizarre as the build. It was bought by a guy who owned a boat company of some sort, then signed over to someone to pay them for work, then given to that guy’s parents for paying off his student loans.</p>
<p>One of the best parts of this story is the janky condition of the SEMA Ford Expedition XLT SeaScape. You might think such a creation would’ve held up great under the test of time, but it didn’t. A piece of wood was covering the sunroof, with white tape wrapped around the ends to keep it on the truck. But ultimately this horrible car purchase gave Tabbutt a funny story, although he was stuck with the truck and its many flaws.</p>
