A three-speed automatic sends power to the rear wheels, where an independent rear like what you find on a Corvette provides the right level of grip. Up front is a four-link suspension. Toto tires provide good grip, while four-wheel power disc brakes help further with control."

Covering that is a metallic silver which sparkles in the sunlight. Nearly perfect brightwork and intricate pinstriping done by Divine One Customs really highlight what makes this car so dazzling to see. Bonspeed alloy wheels add to that effect without detracting from the body lines. No matter where you take this Roadster, it will get people noticing and talking in a hurry."

Recaro bucket seats offer large padded bolsters and extendable thigh support, so you can sit comfortably for long drives. You’ll also stay entertained with the AM/FM/CD stereo with USB input. A banjo sports steering wheel, AutoMeter gauges, and Lokar floor shifter also keep everything looking like it belongs."
