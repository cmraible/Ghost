Built for racing, touring and generally having fun with the car, these old classics are some of the most interesting cars to ever come out of Italy. So it would make sense that there’s a pretty hefty market when it comes to restoring vintage Ferraris that have been subject to the crippling hands of time. Here’s a great example of exactly this sort of thing: A complete restoration to new condition, by a restoration shop that specializes in classic Ferraris."

However, the shop worked with the car’s owner to perfect a darker blue. The interior was also ready for a complete refresh - so that meant period specific leather and a lot more. Along with the body and inside, the engine got a full refurbishing and purred back to life as the car was eventually delivered to its owner in peak condition. Overall, this was an exciting experience and shows off just how good the Farland  Classic Restoration crew is at getting the job done right. They’ve finished this one, now they’re ready for another.
