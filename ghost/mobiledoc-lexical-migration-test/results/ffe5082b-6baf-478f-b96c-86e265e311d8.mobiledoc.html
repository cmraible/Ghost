<hr>
<p>The muscle car market has been an interesting beast to track over the last few decades. After the explosion of mainstream popularity of auto auctions, cars that were once disregarded by a clueless owner, are now the most sought after cars around. This has also effectively turned car collectors into treasure hunters, who would appreciate these rare muscle cars, with less than 10 examples that ever made it to the road.</p>

<p>If you've never seen a 'Cuda 'Vert in person, you're not alone. Only seven people were able to get their hands on the Hemi 'Cuda in 1971, and if you can find one today, expect to dish out somewhere near $4 million if you want to own it.</p>

<p>If your mind goes to 1968 when you hear the mention of a GT500 convertible, that's natural, but there were some convertibles made in 1966. The problem would be buying one back then, since they were only available to Shelby's close friends and family. Although rarely up for sale, one did cross the auction block at Mecum with a hammer price of $1.1 million this July.</p>

While the special edition car was ordered as a two-door coupe, Hurst built a limited amount of convertibles for three customers.</p>

<p>1969 was the inaugural year of the Trans Am for the Firebird line, and easily one of the most popular monikers. Only 689 Trans Am hardtops were made in 1969, making them pretty rare, but if you can find a soft top, you're looking at only one of eight to ever exist. The most recent for sale date we can find is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1969-pontiac-trans-am-ram-air-v/">1969 Trans Am</a> 'Vert that failed to sell with a high bid of $1.9 million. </p>
