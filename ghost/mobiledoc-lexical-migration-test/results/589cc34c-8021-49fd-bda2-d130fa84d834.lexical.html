<p>Those who own Google Glass but use an iPhone received a bit of good news today, followed by some bad news: Google’s MyGlass companion app was reportedly added to the App Store, unlocking more of Glass’s potential for those who don’t carry an Android-powered device around. This news, reported by <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/12/17/google-glass-companion-app-myglass-launches-for-iphone/">9 to 5 Mac</a>, continued Google’s tradition of cross-platform support for many of its apps and services, despite the fact that it actively develops a competing operating system. But just as quickly as the app went up, it disappeared.</p>

<p>I’ve tried a few times myself to view the MyGlass app in iTunes but, unfortunately, I’ve been receiving an “Item Not Available” error that says the item can’t be downloaded from the U.S. store. Other publications managed to view the app and get some screen grabs, but it looks like MyGlass is no longer available for everyone else to download. I’ve searched Twitter to see if others are experiencing this same problem, and I do see a couple of people who say the app is no longer in the store.</p>
<p>The app’s publication could have been a mistake, as it was done with very little fanfare. Google Glass is still a project and the wearable headset isn’t available at retail, but the app going up without any sort of word from Google was a bit bizarre. It’s quite possible that the MyGlass app was never meant to go up in the first place. Or… cue dramatic music… is something more sinister at play here? Did Apple approve and quickly pull the app?</p>
<p>We’ll keep a close eye on this one. Stay tuned.</p>
