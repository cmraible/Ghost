<p>President Joe Biden has tried to take advantage of recent union victories, declaring “Amazon, here we come” after workers scored a historic win at one of the retailer’s Staten Island warehouses. But in reality, when it comes to supporting unionization efforts at Amazon and other retailers, Biden is all talk, and very little action.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etaaPsZzBF8">new video</a> demonstrates, despite Biden’s promise to be “the most pro-union president,” he’s largely <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-offers-amazon-workers-rhetoric-but-no-action/">refused to take even basic steps</a> to boost labor efforts — such as implementing his own union task force’s major recommendations, or reinstating an Obama-era rule requiring companies like Amazon to disclose all of their spending to crush union drives. </p>
<p>Could the campaign cash and political connections tying the Democratic Party to Amazon and anti-union law firms have anything to do with the state of affairs? Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etaaPsZzBF8">new video</a> to find out.</p>
