Chrome on the bumpers, hood ornament, etc. appears fresh as well. All the body panels are straight and the correct badges are in their appropriate places. You’ll notice in the bed are some nice oak slats, which are finished for a rich, natural look that everyone loves in these old trucks. The rest of the payload is painted white, with nary a scratch visible, showing a truly thorough restoration and light use afterward. Completing the factory look are OE steel wheels, which have nice wide white wall tires wrapped around them, just like you’d see back in the day."

The interior comes with some nice surprises like aftermarket air conditioning, so you’re not roasting during summertime cruises. A retro-fit radio doesn’t ruin the aesthetics of the cab while it allows you to listen to your tunes without trouble. The red and white color scheme is nice, while the upholstery and carpeting are free of major wear or damage."
