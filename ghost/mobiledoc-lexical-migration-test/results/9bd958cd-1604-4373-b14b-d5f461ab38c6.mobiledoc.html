<h2 id="fast-company-is-back-up">Fast Company is back up</h2>
<p>Last week, the tech business <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2022/09/morning-coffee-reading-hacked-ignored-and-artificially-created/">site got hacked so hard</a> that the publishers had to pull it down. After eight days, <em>Fast Company</em> and associated sites are finally back up, presumably having cleaned out their CMS database of any nasties left behind by the hackers, and hardened their systems. </p>
<p>Of note: they moved into “zero click” publishing — platform publishing — while the site was down:</p>
<blockquote>So last Wednesday, we began to publish new articles on various platforms, starting with LinkedIn (our first article: the scoop that Everette Taylor had been named Kickstarter’s new CEO), and then on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Medium. The following day, we launched Fast Company Daily, a LinkedIn newsletter that quickly reached 103,000 subscribers. When news broke that Elon Musk plans to buy Twitter after all, we covered it in real time via Twitter Spaces. It was all Fast Company, just not on our owned and operated site. </blockquote>
<p>Will they build on that, or just revert to the way they were publishing before?</p>

<h2 id="so-is-kiwi-farms">So is Kiwi Farms</h2>
<p>So, remember all the pieces from a few weeks ago about how Kiwi Farms —the notorious site where its users obsessively cyberstalk and mock (“milk” in their parlance) “lolcows”, the internet micro celebs they find amusing — had been taken down by a concerted campaign spearheaded by Twitch stream Keffals? </p>
<p>Well, the site has been back up for the best part of a week. No, I'm not going to link it. If you really want to go there, you can find it yourself. </p>
<p>I find the lack of follow-up on this story rather disturbing, not least because many people will be happily assuming that the site is gone, while its users go on merrily doing their thing.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%93%9A-ive-got-a-book-coming-out%E2%80%A6-%F0%9F%93%9A">📚 I've got a book coming out… 📚</h2>
<p>Late last year, and early this, I spent a lot of time chasing interviews with key chief marketing officers, from a huge range of businesses. Along with my <a href="https://nextconf.eu/blog/#gref"><em>NEXT Insights</em></a> collaborator, Martin Recke, we pulled together <a href="https://nextconf.eu/books/next-level-cmo/">a book</a> that I'm really very proud of. It's a beautiful object with some great information inside. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/next-level-cmo-facebook-1200x1500-0480.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1186" height="1187" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/next-level-cmo-facebook-1200x1500-0480.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/next-level-cmo-facebook-1200x1500-0480.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/next-level-cmo-facebook-1200x1500-0480.jpg 1186w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>It's notionally a book about the way the chief marketing officer role has changed, but in reality, it's actually a book about the digital transformation of businesses.</p>
<p>Why, yes, you <em>should</em> pre-order it. Thanks for suggesting it!</p>
