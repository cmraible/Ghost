<p>Few cars, American or otherwise, evoke the same kind of response as a classic C2 Stingray. Even among those legends, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/168106/1965-chevrolet-corvette">1965 Chevrolet Corvette</a> convertible is drop-dead gorgeous. The car has benefited from an obviously quite thorough body-off restoration process that left no detail out of place. As a result, this car is immaculate enough to be displayed in a museum or any venue you can imagine.</p>

<p>All 31 of the fiberglass panels have been painted a silky smooth black, hugging every amazing curve. Pop-up headlights and a retractable black top help make this an even more entertaining ride. It rolls on the factory original wheels. The restoration process left overall fit and finish well beyond the original factory standards, which is why this car looks like a million bucks.</p>

<p>This ‘Vette is packing serious heat under the hood. A 327ci V8 pumps out a solid 350 horsepower, so you can press down the accelerator and feel the rush. Through the four-speed manual transmission makes you feel ultra-connected to the car, plus it features a lockout. A factory differential is mounted to the frame, resulting in smoother performance and keeping rubber on the road instead of hopping uselessly.</p>
<p>Appropriately, this Stingray has a black interior color scheme, including supple leather bucket seats. The dash matches the body color and contains factory gauges plus controls. A wood and aluminum steering wheel helps complete the premium ambiance without detracting from the solid performance qualities of this ride.</p>
<p>Chevrolet made a number of changes to the C2 Corvette Stingray for 1965. New louvres located behind the front wheels increase airflow through the engine compartment, while a new hood and front grille design, plus bright aluminum body sill moldings gussy up the already sleek exterior. This ‘Vette from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/RK+Motors">RK Motors</a> is one of the best restored 1965 models that’s been kicking around in a long time, so if you’re at all inclined you should act fast to scoop it since it should be scooped in a hurry.</p>
