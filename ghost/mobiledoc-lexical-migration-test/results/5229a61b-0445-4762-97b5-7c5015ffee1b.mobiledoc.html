<p>Acquiring a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1958-ferrari-250-gt-lwb-california-could-hammer-at-11-million/">Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider</a>, one of the most iconic cars to ever roll out of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/">Maranello</a>, comes with a steep price tag. The classic sports cars, of which there were only 106 made, can sell for up to $16 million, an amount which undoubtedly will continue to climb. That’s well out of reach for even many affluent enthusiasts, so <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/company-making-ferrari-parts/">GTO Engineering</a> has introduced a modern version of the classic Ferrari.</p>
<blockquote><em>Do you know <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/">these</a> ten things about the Ferrari F40?</em></blockquote>
<p>Revealed at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sir-stirling-moss-honored/">Goodwood Revival</a>, an event which features pre-1966 cars for retro-good times, the revival model is generating some buzz. GTO Engineering uses a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ferrari-f40-bandit-edition/">donor car</a> to create the modern Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider, however it has to be a Ferrari and not a vehicle from another brand, for legal reasons. Trust us, you don’t want to cross Ferrari legally since the Italians aggressively defend their intellectual property.</p>

<p>To transform a donor car into the classic convertible, GTO Engineering pours 1,500 of painstaking craftsmanship into the process. The body is hand-formed aluminum and the details are exquisite, inside and out. Buyers can opt for the 3.0-liter V12 or upgrade to one displacing 3.5 or 4.0 liters. A 4-speed or 5-speed manual transmission is also offered.</p>

<p>The idea of the revival Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider is affordability. After all, even if you can afford to drop $16 million on an original car, you’d be insane to drive it on public roads. No matter how careful you are, there’s no controlling what other drivers might do, so taking the convertible out for even the shortest pleasure cruise could be an anxiety-inducing event.</p>

<p>Still, don’t expect your replica Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider to be affordable by traditional standards. Depending on the donor car you provide and the final specifications, GTO Engineering might charge you anywhere from $1.04-1.18 million for creating one. In other words, this is still a plaything for the ultra-rich.</p>
