Initially, many news outlets blamed the problem solely on the covid lockdowns and economic unrest. However, even as those factors have waned or even gone away, car thefts have kept going strong. The theory also ignores the fact that the crime wave started well before anyone heard of COVID-19. One of the favorite targets of thieves are the Dodge Charger and Challenger, prompting Stellantis to roll out enhanced security features to be installed in certain models but not all. The hope is that will help stop this trend, but whether or not it’s effective remains to be seen.",
