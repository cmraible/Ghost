From the get-go, you're tossed into the campaign and moving through a series of stages, killing dozens of demons, zombies and other abominations. You’re equipped with 18 weapons, each having their own main firing mode and secondary firing modes when aiming down the sights. You can use your fists, hand-guns, super shotguns, and even more advanced weaponry like the fantastic plasma rifle with homing shots and lock on features. Each weapon feels incredibly punchy and blasting zombies into pieces has never been this satisfying. "

It's strange as the map maker content is flowing with online content but no one’s actually playing the multiplayer, which seems a little odd to me. This is the same for the online co-op for the campaign, a feature that you can’t even play local multiplayer split-screen for.
