This made the body very rigid while reducing weight at the same time, however, it was also flammable when traditionally welded. The solution was to rivet the body panels to the car, something that give it a distinctive seam."

The riveted dorsal fin remained as a style statement, although it wasn’t strictly necessary any more. This model was originally launched as the Aéro Coupé, but after Jean Bugatti’s friend, aviation pioneer Jean Mermoz, died while trying to fly across the Atlantic ocean, the nameplate was changed in his honor."

It was used for motor shows and publicity before it became Jean Bugatti’s personal car for a while. It is believed that Chassis No. 57453 was then given to Bugatti racer Robert Benoist after winning the Le Mans 24 Hour in 1937. It was then gifted to another Bugatti racer, William Grover-Williams, before being returned to the factory in 1939 when he relocated to England."

Bugatti states that it lost track of the car in 1938, but the last rumours of ‘La Voiture Noire’ was when its chassis number was changed to 57454 and sent to Bordeaux for safety from the war."

It could have boarded a ship before the Germans seized control of France, it might have been destroyed to be keept out of enemy hands, or it could still be tucked away in a barn somewhere. The latter possibility still has collectors scouring Europe for any trace of this elusive classic. Another possibility is that it could have been lost at sea while making its escape, thanks to the unrestricted nature of submarine warfare at the time."
