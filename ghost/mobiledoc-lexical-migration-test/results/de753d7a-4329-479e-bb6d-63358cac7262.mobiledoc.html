<p>This morning I had plans to write some quick thoughts about the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/27/twitter-elon-musk/">Musking of Twitter</a>. But events at City overtook me and, in the end, I’m just writing this up now as I wait for a train home. I’d initially planned to suggest we’d see a few days before we saw waves of layoffs because Musk is smart enough to know not to cut too fast in departments critical to the site’s functioning.</p>
<p>And so, I was more than a little surprised to see reporters saying that an entire team of data engineers was gone:</p>

<p>At first glance, I thought it was a good thing that I hadn’t posted this morning — I wasn’t expecting staff layoffs to start <em>that</em> quickly. But it looked like they had. And the tweets supporting the story kept coming:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/Tweet-by-Yasmin-Khorram.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-28/musk-starts-cutting-jobs-at-twitter-staff-leave-with-boxes?srnd=premium&sref=ExbtjcSG">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/28/musk-first-day-owning-twitter-leads-to-havoc-and-possible-hoax-.html">CNBC</a> had written it up. It must be accurate, right?</p>
<h2 id="remember-double-sourcing-anyone">Remember double-sourcing, anyone?</h2>
<p>But the more I looked at it, the more odd it seemed. Just two people, no corroborating sources — was this what it seemed. Others were raising questions, based on contacts within Twitter:</p>

<p>And then the climb-downs started:</p>

<p>And then I saw the give-away on the Reuters Live Stream:</p>

<p>Ligma. <em>Ligma</em>? Oh, boy.</p>
<h2 id="ligma-was-a-clear-signal-this-story-is-balls">Ligma was a clear signal this story is balls</h2>
<p>It’s part of an <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ligma">old internet joke</a>, where, if you get it, you reply “Balls”. Try it. Say “Ligma Balls” out loud (preferably not in an open-plan office). You’ll see the (rather juvenile) joke.</p>
<p><em>It’s a fake.</em> Those reporters outside Twitter have been trolled by two guys with a sense of humour and some boxes. And they ran the story without independent corroboration. That’s ending up on my verification slides…</p>
<p>Journalists with a little more awareness of internet culture quickly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428775/twitter-fake-employee-layoff-rahul-ligma-elon-musk">debunked the story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>There are plenty of problems with what these two men say to reporters. The most glaring is that one man identifies himself as a software engineer named “Rahul Ligma.” <em>The Verge </em>has confirmed that name does not exist in Twitter’s Slack or email system. There is also no evidence that the employee exists on LinkedIn.</blockquote>

<p>Stories were quickly edited, and the journalists who had jumped too quickly had to start climbing down. This is not a tweet anybody wants to have to send:</p>

<p>However, it’s rather terrifying that at least two major news outlets, without any other sources, reported that there were Twitter employees being laid off. </p>
<p>This is the real danger when live reporting and social media intersect. Caught up in the excitement of the moment, Bosa tweeted out an essentially single-sourced story with no qualifications or caveats at all. I’ve used a screen grab above because I assume that this tweet will eventually be deleted, but it’s still live now:</p>

<p>No, it’s not. It might, and probably will. But you were trolled. And basic journalism practice would have saved embarrassment.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Twitter’s new “Chief Twit” had to have the final word:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/Tweet-by-Elon-Musk.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>And that, folks, is the sense of humour of the new guy in charge of Twitter.</p>
<p>This is going to be a ride…</p>
