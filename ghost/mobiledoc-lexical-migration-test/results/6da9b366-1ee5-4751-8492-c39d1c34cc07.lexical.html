<p>The most expensive car scheduled for the Amelia Island auction is this 1958 Ferrari 250 GT LWB California Spider with an estimated auction price set between $9 million and $11 million. </p>
<p>Ferrari sought out to build a car that was the best of both worlds, to serve as a daily driver as well as a fun race toy, and that was when the 250 GT convertible was born. A Carrozzeria Scaglietti design, this car is stunning but can also put down on the track.</p>
<p>Produced from 1957 through 1963, only 106 of these cars were built. 50 examples were given a long wheelbase while 56 were equipped with a short wheelbase configuration. </p>
<p>This particular California Spider has seen eight owners and has plenty of documentation that shows its history. Certified by Ferrari Classiche, the car went under the knife for a complete and detailed restoration, but still has its original chassis, drivetrain, coachwork, covered headlamps, along with a rare hardtop.</p>

<p>Only 14 of these Type 55s were ever built with a roadster body. While that number is incredibly low, only 11 are said to have the original bodywork.
