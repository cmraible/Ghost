<hr>
<p>When it comes to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-pontiac-trans-ams/">American</a> coupes with pickup beds, Ford beat Chevrolet to the punch, plain and simple. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-mustang-boss-429-prototype/">Ford</a> Ranchero debuted in 1957, with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/patina-restomod-truck/">Chevrolet</a> El Camino joining the fray in 1959.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/el-camino-drag-car-is-a-hulk-racer/">El Camino</a> would outlast the Ranchero. While the Ranchero would quietly bow out after the 1979 model year, the El <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-aussie-kangaroo-chaser/">Camino</a> would continue on until 1987 on the well-loved G-body platform.</p>

<p>We found <a href="https://denver.craigslist.org/cto/d/caney-barn-find-1984-chevy-ss-el-camino/7202188138.html">this 1984 El Camino</a> on Craigslist in Denver, Colorado. This El Camino's first and only owner is 84 years old now, and he's ready to let his beloved El Camino go.</p>
<p>The owner still has their original bill of sale, as well as every bit of paperwork for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1958-el-camino-selling/">El Camino</a> since new. In over 35 years, it's covered just 62,000 miles.</p>

<p>The body and paint of this El Camino is far from perfect, but the ad claims that it's 100% rust-free. With a fresh paint job, this El Camino would look incredible.</p>
<p>The interior looks terrific, minus a cracked dash. Everything is said to work except for the air conditioning, which requires a recharge at the very least. That's to be expected on any vehicle this old, though.</p>

<p>Under the hood, you'll find a 5.0 liter 305 cubic inch V8 fed by a four barrel carburetor. This El Camino is badged as an SS, although it clearly does not have the Choo Choo Customs Monte Carlo SS aero nose.</p>
<p>Despite the slightly bruised body, there's a price to pay for rust-free originality. In this case, you'll have to fork over around seven grand. Maybe we're biased – we like these G-body El Caminos quite a bit – but we think it's worth every penny.</p>
