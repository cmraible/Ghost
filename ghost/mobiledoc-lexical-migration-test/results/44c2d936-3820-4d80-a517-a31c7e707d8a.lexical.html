<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/canadian-international-car-theft/">Car theft</a> has become a crime that seems so normal to hear about, the internet is riddled with stories of stolen performance vehicles, mostly Dodge, so much so that it has become diluted in our minds. Unfortunately, for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/muscle-car-birthday/">car enthusiasts</a> especially, it is still a very real and grave threat to many. For some people it may be their only transportation, others might just be collectors, either way, the idea of somebody waltzing into a shop and taking your car like it's theirs is terrifying. Recently the crime has become somewhat glorified in a sense, however, it is important to remember that at their core these people are self-centered, entitled, doorknobs that think that other people should forfeit their property, that they worked hard to achieve so that they don't have to work.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the victim was the famous chef and TV show host Guy Fieri. The world-renowned TV personality is a household name, making a name for himself for his creative concoctions of food he has also amassed quite a large fortune. That $8.5 million net worth has gone toward his collection of some of the coolest cars out there, including one bright Yellow Lamborghini Gallardo. The car was stolen in 2011 and taken on various joyrides over a couple of years before being found. While in the shop for maintenance, the thief in question was a 16-year-old boy who repelled down from the roof, cracked the window, disabled the alarm, and drove off.</p>

<p>After having been driven around for a few years, the car was found in the thief’s storage locker and he was brought to court in 2013. Not only did the charges include vehicle theft but also the attempted murder of sentences. The case resulted in Wade, the thief, being sentenced to life in prison. It may seem a bit harsh for a 16-year-old but that is up for the individual to decide for themself. Hopefully, this will serve as a reminder that other people’s cars are just that, other people's cars.</p>
