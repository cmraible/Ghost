          "This was the first passenger car from Europe to use a turbocharger, and that alone makes it notable. The 2002 had already earned a reputation for excellent road manners, but BMW engineers decided to spice things up by adding a turbo to the 2.0-liter engine, producing 170-horsepower. You can drive it at lower RPMs and the car is actually quite tame, but let the engine rev to 4,000 rpm and the turbo dials things up to a new level of performance.  A 4-speed manual transmission allows for proper performance driving"

On the exterior are also the turbo and tri-strip graphics, plus original badges. Styling elements which make this Turbo immediately distinguishable from other 2002 models include the more muscular wheel arches, trunk lid-mounted spoiler, and sportier front air dam."
