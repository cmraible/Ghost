<p>GamingIntel, a website that has been right in the past concerning Nintendo Directs, reveals that the next one shouldn’t be too far away.</p>
<p>At the end of of December 2018, their source stated:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>There is a Nintendo Direct planned for January. I’m working to gather more information on it as of now.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bringing us to now, their source had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>I was told January 10th from one source. This hasn’t been cross checked between sources. Most of my other sources are still undecided on an exact date, but certain of a Nintendo January Direct.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn’t all that surprising to hear that a Nintendo Direct will be happening this month as the Big N generally have Directs to kick-start the year. That being said, January 10th is only a week away and we can’t help but get excited!</p>
