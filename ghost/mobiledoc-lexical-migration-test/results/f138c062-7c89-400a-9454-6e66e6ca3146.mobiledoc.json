Equus co-owner Michael Shariff says it takes between 4,500 to 5,000 man hours to assemble just one car. Under those stamped aluminum body panels with carbon-fiber liners is an all-aluminum frame. In other words, it might look and even perform like a muscle car, but it’s built like a supercar."

Considering Equus dropped an LS9, the same supercharged V8 used in the C6 ZR1 with 640-horsepower on tap, it certainly fit the bill. With the horsepower wars continuing to rage for now, that might not feel like as big of a number as it did seven years ago, but even by today’s standards it’s still impressive. Plus, the Bass 770 can rip from 0-60 in a claimed 3.4 seconds and hit 200 mph, proving it’s a real performer."

Yes, there’s a touchscreen infotainment center and electronic door handles, but the innovations go even further. For example, Brembo carbon ceramic brakes and a magnetic suspension provide greater control when pushing the car toward its limits. Even with all the innovations, the driving experience is kept pure with a six-speed manual gearbox."
