<p>Back when the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/make-then-envious-with-this-1956-porsche-356a-speedster/">Porsche 356</a> ruled racetracks both in Europe and North America, the German automaker decided to make an even more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-porsche-911-by-singer-review/">aggressive lightweighting</a> and other modifications suitable for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-historic-trans-am-racers-get-flogged-at-sonoma/">serious competition</a>. This car was called the Porsche 356B Super 90 GT, which shed 200 pounds off the coupe. A mere 14 rolled out of the factory, so as you can imagine it’s rare when one is available for purchase and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1987-porsche-959-is-porsches-original-supercar/">they command a fortune</a>.</p>

<p>What we have here is a well-sorted and documented Porsche 356B made to look like a Super 90 GT. In fact, correct factory specifications were used by Carrosserie Gretener in Southern California, the shop which gave this Porsche its restoration in the late 1990s. Parts sourced from GT Werks were used in the process, with an outcome which is both beautiful and should withstand close scrutinization by sharp critics.</p>

<p>While that’s quite the list of changes, there’s still more. Vic Skirmants from 356 Enterprise rebuilt the engine, adding a polished 912 crank, more aggressive camshaft, new pistons and cylinders, plus had everything balanced and blueprinted. That means this Porsche really moves now.</p>

<p>As for the transmission being reconditioned, that was done by John Bunnin in San Diego. His work included high gears in first, second, and third for the purpose of quicker acceleration.</p>
