The glass and trim look pretty good, but there’s a dent in the roof. And while the engine and transmission are thought to be original, the seller says this is an X44 car, so the Z/28 package wasn’t installed in the factory. That’s a critical part of determining the value of this vehicle."

It has a Buy It Now price of $30,000. Since the auction is set to end on the morning of June 2, there might not be too much movement on this Camaro until later this month, but we expect it might sell for more than that up-front price. Unfortunately, not being a real Z/28 it doesn’t command quite as high of a price, so that could really hurt its chances. But you just never know for sure."
