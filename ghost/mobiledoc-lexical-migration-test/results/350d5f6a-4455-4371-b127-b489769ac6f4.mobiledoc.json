In Haiku, the Robot, you play as… Haiku, the robot, and you fight some baddies in the world of Arcadia. The world and the NPCs are very industrial and robotic, and to be honest, I didn’t really follow the plot because it isn’t actually explained particularly well. But it doesn’t matter because Haiku, the Robot is a Metroidvania in the truest sense of the word and finding your way around Arcadia and its many nooks and crannies is what this game is all about."

What I loved about this in Haiku, the Robot is that it all fits together perfectly and the pacing of the power ups was absolutely nailed. They all arrive at the perfect time just as your adventure was becoming tricky, and you can’t beat that feeling of going out of your way to find something that makes your life that little bit easier."

Once destroyed, that area’s map shows up whereas previously, prior to destroying the beacon, the area is blacked out on the map. There were occasions where I knew I had to go to a certain area to progress the plot (based on what an NPC had said to me) but then that involved visiting one of the blacked out map areas so I had no idea where to go! I found this quite frustrating and, occasionally, time-wasting."
