And it‚Äôs been commissioned and shot for play on *Instagram*.\n\nIt seems that social networks are becoming the new TV. And in that light the [latest ‚ÄúTwitter for sale‚Äù rumour](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-26/disney-said-to-be-working-with-adviser-on-potential-twitter-bid) makes sense:\n\n> Walt Disney Co. is working with a financial adviser to evaluate a possible bid for Twitter Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n## Now streaming on Twitter\n\nWhy? Because Twitter is quietly becoming a *video* company. [Mathew Ingram](http://fortune.com/2016/09/26/disney-twitter-bid/):\n\n> With its resources, Disney would be able to help Twitter improve its video streaming and possibly strike new deals with other content providers. As a result of a recent acquisition, Disney owns a stake in BAMTech, the digital arm of Major League Baseball, which runs streaming services for ESPN and others, including Twitter.\n\nAs [John Gruber put it](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/09/26/disney-twitter-bloomberg):\n\n> Twitter is a media company and a publishing service, not a social network.\n\nIncreasingly I wonder exactly what *is* a social network in 2016. Snapchat and WhatsApp are less social networks than communication tools. Instagram is a picture sharing service with comms element. Twitter is a publishing platform. Does that just leave Facebook?\n\nNot everyone is certain about [Disney making a good partner for Twitter](http://www.recode.net/2016/9/26/13062276/disney-won-t-buy-twitter), though:\n\n> But if you‚Äôre going to spend $18 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion on something, you need a little bit more than ‚ÄúI like the dude who runs the company.‚Äù\n\nBear in mind that Disney acquired Marvel AND Lucasfilm AND Pixar, for $15 billion. Is Twitter really worth as much to it as those three properties put together?\n\n\n"
