The suspect pointed the gun at each of the three victims, getting the drop on them outside the woman’s parents’ house at about 5:30 pm while they installed new carpet in the Mopar. Now cellphone video shows the man with his buddies doing smokey donuts on public roads in the stolen Charger, adding insult to injury."

Plus, she saw the man’s face while driving one day, a face she can’t forget."
