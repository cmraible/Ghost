So we thought that we’d share what we’ve been predicting in our sleep-deprived minds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So without further ado, here are our Nintendo E3 2018 predictions…</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo Switch</span></h1>\n<p><iframe title=\"Super Smash Bros. is coming to Nintendo Switch!\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3Gt42kVgCw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s get through the obvious one because we all know that Super Smash Bros. is going to be there &#8211; Nintendo said it themselves. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t make some predictions about the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The signs are definitely pointing towards a new game, but we still don’t have confirmation. But in the spirit of predictions, we are going to say that it </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be a new game as Sakurai has certainly dropped some strong hints. How does </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Smash Bros.: Assault</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sound? </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Smash Bros.: Mayhem</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Or just plain old </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo Switch</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, some new characters are sure to be announced, and we actually have a </span><a href=\"http://switchaboo.com/2018/03/13/top-10-characters-like-see-come-super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">list of characters we would like to see make it into the new game (some realistic, some pie in the sky)</span></a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so we won&#8217;t list them all here. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metroid Prime 4 gameplay</span></h1>\n<p><iframe title=\"Metroid Prime 4 - First Look - Nintendo E3 2017\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFbDmTjS_MI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was nearly an entire year ago that we got that beautiful logo announcing a brand new Metroid Prime game. But ever since then, we haven’t seen a thing. The only thing we know is that Bandai Namco </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be developing the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A nice lengthy gameplay trailer would really ease a lot of fans&#8217; minds and could hold us all over until we know more; because, we’re calling it now, Metroid Prime 4 won’t be coming out this year.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earthbound trilogy collection</span></h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1849\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mother.png?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Mother Earthbound Trilogy E3 2018\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mother.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mother.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mother.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mother.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How cool would this be?! Every E3 we think that year will be the year, but this one just feels right. Just think about it; Nintendo released Earthbound Beginnings on the Wii U and they probably had plans to release Mother 3, however with the Switch release coming up, they realized that they could release it as a collection with all three titles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that we can play unofficial roms online, but we are dedicated to hold off until it gets a physical release. We’re taking a stand!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Fox Grand Prix</span></h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1815\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=900%2C675\" alt=\"Retro Studios Star Fox Grand Prix\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/star-fox-grand-prix.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2014, Retro Studios have been on radio silence.

A Star Fox racing game.

This game was announced BEFORE the Switch was released! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we think that this year’s E3 is when it will finally get shown off. Every Fire Emblem’s cutscenes on the Nintendo 3DS looked absolutely amazing, and to imagine that in HD &#8211; stunning!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d love to predict what the game will entail, however we know absolutely nothing other than it’s a thing, but we do predict that we’ll be seeing some details real soon.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortnite</span></h1>\n<p><iframe title=\"Fortnite Battle Royale - Gameplay Trailer (Play Free Now!)\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2gUtfBmw86Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people have spoken, and surely Epic Games and Nintendo can’t just ignore them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do we think that it’s going to have an announcement (similar to the Rocket League announcement in Nintendo’s last year E3 showcase), but we predict that there will be some Nintendo Switch exclusive features.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Bayonetta 3</h1>\n<p><iframe title=\"Bayonetta 3 Official Teaser Trailer - The Game Awards 2017\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti-i40Ez6KY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>At the 2017 The Game Awards, we were treated with a trailer for a brand new entry in the Bayonetta franchise. Since then, we have heard almost nothing about Bayonetta 3 and we are still yet to see any gameplay. We feel as though it is time to see a short gameplay trailer this year in just a few short days.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoshi</span></h1>\n<p><iframe title=\"Yoshi for Nintendo Switch - Official Game Trailer - Nintendo E3 2017\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sx_C9jJ0AlA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is it with Yoshi games always releasing so long after being announced?

It&#8217;d just be a missed opportunity if they don&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Mario Odyssey DLC</span></h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1062\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mario-Odyssey.jpg?resize=900%2C450\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mario-Odyssey.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mario-Odyssey.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mario-Odyssey.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mario-Odyssey.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mario-Odyssey.jpg?resize=1300%2C650&amp;ssl=1 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo have embraced DLC lately with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Season Pass and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DLC. So considering that </span><a href=\"http://switchaboo.com/2018/04/26/1713/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Super Mario Odyssey is the best selling title on the Switch with over 10 million units sold</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we’d be shocked if the game doesn’t get some new worlds as DLC.

When we originally heard about this, we assumed that it would be coming to the Wii U… but then it didn’t. So we assumed that it would come to the Switch in its first year… but it didn’t. So where is it?! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, we predict that the wait is finally over and that we will hear about Pikmin 4 at this year’s E3. Because if we don’t, then surely it’s cancelled or something went wrong.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Crazy New IP</span></h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Question-Mark.png?resize=900%2C675\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nintendo have been thinking outside the box lately with some crazy new ideas, and we don’t think that that stopped with Splatoon and ARMS. Every E3, there is always one big thing that no one sees coming, and we think that Nintendo are going to show off something brand new. But what could it be? Something that only the wacky minds at Nintendo could come up with!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you think that our predictions will prove to be accurate?
