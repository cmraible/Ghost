This engine received LS3 heads, a custom camshaft and upgraded internals resulting in 597 horsepower measured at the rear wheels on a dyno. A 4L80E automatic transmission was built up to handle all that power, and a Ford nine-inch rear end with a Detroit Locker helps send all that power to the ground.",
