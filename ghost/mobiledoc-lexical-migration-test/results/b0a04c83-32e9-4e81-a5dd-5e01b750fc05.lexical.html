<p>Innovation emerges when you steal ideas from elsewhere and apply them to a new field. We spend an awful lot of our time in the western world looking at each other's journalism operations, and not nearly enough seeing what we can learn from news operations in very different parts of the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraOliver?s=20">Laura Oliver</a> has been doing some research on the Global South for the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk">Reuters Institute</a>, and some of the results are fascinating.</p>
<p>For example, there's some interesting case studies here of how using solutions journalism can avoid the news avoidance that comes with unrelenting bad news:</p>
<blockquote>“Solutions stories give a sense of hope that not all is lost,” says Gabriela Brenes, Director of <em>La Voz</em>. They can also create “a sense of pride and resilience” in a province which is “vibrant and complex” but often overlooked. “Whenever we publish these stories, it sparks a sense of ownership and resilience that translates into this pride saying, ‘We made it against all odds, and here's everything the province is doing,’” she says. </blockquote>

<p>And then there's the role of messaging apps in news propagation. Under-discussed in Europe and the US right now, but with potential for growth:</p>
