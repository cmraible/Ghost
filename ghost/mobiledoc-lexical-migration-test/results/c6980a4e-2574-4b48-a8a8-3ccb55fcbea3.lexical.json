The true official announcement for Pokemon Let&#8217;s Go Pikachu and Pokemon Let&#8217;s Go Eevee releasing November 16, 2018.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the trailer that we were given&#8230;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Pokémon: Let&#039;s Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let&#039;s Go, Eevee! Trailer\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jRtpMKLsts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>There is a lot to unpack in that trailer, but it&#8217;s interesting to see that the catching mechanic from Pokemon Go is in the game. As promised, there seems to be a lot of connectivity with Pokemon Go, which may bring a lot of people back to the mobile game.</p>\n<p>It also seems that the rumors about returning to Kanto were true, as we see Professor Oak and many more hints in the trailer.</p>\n<p>But if this doesn&#8217;t do it for you, then the Pokemon company also announced that ANOTHER core Pokemon RPG will be releasing in 2019.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what do you think? Is this everything that you were hoping for, or did the trailer let you down a bit?
