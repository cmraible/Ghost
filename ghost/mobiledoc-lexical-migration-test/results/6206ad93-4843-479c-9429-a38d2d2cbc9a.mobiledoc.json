We think this is possibly just a somewhat lazy cash grab by GM, similar to how it applied the storied Blazer name to a product that’s nothing like the original truck. We expect a Corvette sedan or crossover, not to mention those same form factors for the Camaro name, will be met with about the same enthusiasm as the Mustang Mach-E. Sure, the non-car weirdos love having a “sporty” crossover or sedan, but to enthusiasts they just sully the name and legacy."
