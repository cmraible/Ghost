This secondary color acts perfectly as a subtle accent to the body's burgundy hue."

The front part of the body angles in to expose the matte black frame rails, and the rear-mounted fuel tank sits just above the Chevelle-sourced rear end. The only remnants of any factory body work on this truck are the heavily customized doors and the stamped rear cab panel."
