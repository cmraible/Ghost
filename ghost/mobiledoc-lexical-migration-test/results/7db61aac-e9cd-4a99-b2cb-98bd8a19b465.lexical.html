<p>In April of 1967, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ronaldo-adds-ferrari-monza/">Ferrari</a> embarked on creating the L-series Dino 246 GT. As a progression of the 206 GT model, it would retain many of the features from its predecessor but would be built on a longer wheelbase while also getting a larger engine. It was powered by a 195-horsepower 2.4-liter V6 engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. Of the 357 cars built from April 1969 to October 1970 all of them were <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/america-has-just-one-left-hand-drive-mazda-rx-7-spirit-r/">left-hand-drive</a> examples and this example completed on September 5th 1969 is no exception. </p>

<p>This Ferrari Dino 246 GT was originally intended for U.S. import and was originally sold to Evan E. Kimble, possibly of the Kimble Glass Company. While it is unclear if the car ever actually made it to the U.S., as Kimble was reported to have been living in Germany at the time, the car was registered with New Jersey plates. In 1988, the car was sold with a reported 50k-miles showing to Christopher Joel of Surrey, England for £10,000. A complete restoration was done by Ferrari specialist Kevin O'Rourke of Moto Technique Ltd of Surrey and the car was converted to right-hand-drive and fitted with a new speedometer showing 0-miles. Restoration costs at the time totaled to over £83k. </p>
<p>November 5th, 1996 marks the first time the car was registered in the UK and as of late 2020 it has been registered in Ireland. Now showing just over 25k-miles on the odometer, the stunning Dino Blu 1969 Ferrari Dino 246 GT is again ready for new ownership and is scheduled for auction. There has been mass interest in this car from around the globe already and the car is set to sell at Merlin Car Auctions, Naas, Co. Kildare on June 15th, 2021 at 10.30am.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oxa-ffzitrY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
