This model year is recognizable by the dual, stacked headlights, and just like the 1978 model, the styling is defined by the fire engine red paint job, gold body graphics and, of course, the dual chrome exhaust stacks just behind the cab. What really sets this sport truck apart is the tuned 360 cubic-inch V8 with a four barrel carburetor, and this is backed by a three-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the rear tires through a 9.25-inch limited slip rear end with 3.55 gears."

Aside from the added power outlets and auxiliary gauges inside, the biggest change made from stock was ditching the factory mag wheels in favor of this truck's five-spoke wheels. For added style, this truck adds finned Mopar Performance valve covers to the engine as well as a flush-mounted hard tonneau cover."
