I’ve had a lot of succcess with soups, so I had a nice chicken stock simmering away as the sun slowly set down, orange light filtering over the field behind the house.\n\nI never seem to get the time to really cook, and by �really cook� I mean from basic ingredients upwards, so a few hours just pottering around in a good-sized kitchen was bliss.\n\nSlightly more detail than you normally get for a token photo post, I know, but I do like to share�\n\nTechnorati Tags: [cooking](http://www.technorati.com/tag/cooking), [life](http://www.technorati.com/tag/life), [lifestyle](http://www.technorati.com/tag/lifestyle), [weekends](http://www.technorati.com/tag/weekends)\n\n\n"
