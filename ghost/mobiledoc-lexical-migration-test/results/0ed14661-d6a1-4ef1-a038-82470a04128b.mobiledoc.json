To stop the video being over-exposed, they shoot at very high shutter speeds in bright light, which make the videos properly exposed - but every frame very clean and crisp. In some cases, that's too crisp to people's eyes. A bit of blur in motion makes the video feel more (Lord, I hate this word) cinematic.
