That’s especially true since it pairs up with the punchy Bright Red interior and red graphics, a combination which is one part classy and one part sass. If you ever don’t want the sun beating down or it starts to rain, the white top looks fantastic, so the fun doesn’t have to end there. Oh, and those mag wheels sure go great with everything else, completing such a classic look."

Some enhancements have been added to the already potent engine, including an Edelbrock aluminum intake, 4bbl carb, upgraded distributor/spark plug wires, tube headers, and dual exhaust. The block and valve covers have been painted Pontiac Blue for a genuine look. An automatic transmission makes driving this beast an intimidation-free proposition."

Don’t expect a bunch of modern thrills in this convertible, because It’s been kept as original as possible. You’ll find all the factory controls and gauges, as well as the Pontiac AM/FM radio. Even the woodgrain accents on the dash and console."
