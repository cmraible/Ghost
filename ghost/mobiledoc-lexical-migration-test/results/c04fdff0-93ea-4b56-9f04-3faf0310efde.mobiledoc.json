Well, these days police have more advanced technologies at their disposal, thanks to devices like plate scanners, so even if you get away in a chase you’ll always be looking over your shoulder. We don’t think a Ford Mustang GT driver in Arkansas was thinking clearly about this fact when he took off from an Arkansas State Police trooper who had pulled him over."

Rather than surrender on the spot, the suspect decides he’d rather have his freedom even if he has to live on the lam. This wasn’t the smart choice, but the man had the right vehicle for the job."

With video evidence on top of the fact the trooper confirmed the driver’s identity plus the fact he already has warrants, this suspect is going to be constantly looking over his shoulder until one day he slips up and he’s finally arrested. It’s better to just face the consequences of your actions in life instead of just delaying the because they tend to grow and become worse."
