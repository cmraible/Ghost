With a weight distribution of about 40/60, front/rear ratio, it can be difficult for some to adjust to the unique experience of driving a rear-engine sports car. However, the all-wheel-drive system greatly helps by minimizing loss of traction and oversteering in tight cornering scenarios. The result is an experience that combines the unique weight distribution of a 911 with the excellent traction and superior control of an all-wheel-drive performance vehicle. ",
