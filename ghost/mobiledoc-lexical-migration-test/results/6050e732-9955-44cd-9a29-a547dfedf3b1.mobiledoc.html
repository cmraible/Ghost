<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/the-henry-ford-shuts-down-for-coronavirus-outbreak/">coronavirus pandemic</a> has thrown a lot of things off, from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/70th-pebble-beach-concours-postponed-covid-19/">car shows</a> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-covid-19-is-affecting-collector-car-auctions/">auctions</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-museum/">more</a>. While we’re not crying too much over delayed <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/quarantine-car-movies/">movies</a>, the upcoming <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> looked promising. Columbia Pictures doesn’t want anyone to forget the movie is still coming out, although it’s been delayed from this summer to probably March of 2021, but that could change again. To keep us all excited during the delay the studio has released a featurette about restoring the original <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/us-marshals-auction-80s-movie-cars/">Ecto 1</a>.</p>

<p>Out of all the beloved <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/general-lee-graveyard/">TV</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/15-movie-cars/">movie cars</a> the Ecto 1 is up there. Like the whole tone of the original <em>Ghostbusters</em>, it was over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek without going overboard. The 1959 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cadillac-xlr-turnaround-sports-car/">Cadillac</a> Series 62 was actually built by Miller-Meteor and was used not only as a hearse but also an ambulance, ironically.</p>
<p>Repainted and with a roof rack containing an array of instruments designed by Dr. Egon Spengler, the Ecto 1 is truly a unique car. It has the old ambulance siren and flashing blue lights to signal it’s responding to a ghost emergency.</p>
<p>Most people don’t remember that the Ecto 1 was in horrible shape at the beginning of Ghostbusters II. The backfiring, plumes of smoke coming from the tailpipe, and other mechanical problems weren’t movie magic. Instead, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cadillac-xlr-turnaround-sports-car/">Cadillac</a> really was in a state of disrepair. In fact, during filming for the second movie the car broke down on the Brooklyn Bridge. Since it was blocking traffic, the film crew was fined by the police.</p>

<p>Seeing such a legend get brought back to its full glory is definitely satisfying. We can see in the trailer for the <em>Ghostbusters</em> movie there are some new modifications on the Ecto 1, plus no doubt there are some secret features we don’t yet know about. But considering in the trailer the Ecto 1 in <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> looks really rough, we’re sure it’s a different car than the one which was painstakingly restored in the video.</p>
