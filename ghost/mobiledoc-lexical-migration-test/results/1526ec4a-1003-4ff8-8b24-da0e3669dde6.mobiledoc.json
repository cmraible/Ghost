Much to my surprise (and this isn’t a humblebrag — I genuinely didn’t expect to appear) I’ve been shortlisted in the solo newsletter category of the <a href=\"https://publishernewsletters.com/home/shortlist-2023/\">inaugural Publisher Newsletter Awards</a>. This is the first time in my life I’ve entered for an award, and my fragile ego is drawing strength from the validation this shortlisting brings. My Mum would be so very proud, if she hadn’t been dead for 15 years.</p><p>So, bask in the knowledge that you, dear readers, are the sort of people who recognised a quality newsletter <em>before</em> the rest of the media world…</p><p>Anyway, time to prove that I deserve my place among such august peers.</p>"
