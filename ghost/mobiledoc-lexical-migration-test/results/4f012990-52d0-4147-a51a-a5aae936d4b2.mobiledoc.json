          "Station wagons are not exactly known for their ridiculous horsepower or huge displacement engines. For the most part, when we see one of these relics of the past we think of it as an SUV, everything from the wooden trim panels to the boxy rear makes us think of these vehicles as little more than family haulers. However, perhaps that assumption is exactly why we are seeing this vehicle today. While it is true that station wagons were not made to be fast, they are still cars and as goes the nature of car enthusiasts, if it has wheels we shall make it fast!"

          "The vehicle in question is a 1980s model Jeep Grand Wagoneer which is sporting a high horsepower surprise under the hood. Before we talk about that, however, let's talk about the exterior. Wrapping around the set of silver-gray wheels are some BF Goodrich All-terrain T/A tires. Underneath the bumper, an air dam gives hints that this wagon is not everything that it seems to be. The aforementioned “surprise” under the hood is a Hellcat engine! Of course, that motor is famous for its 707 horsepower, the 6.2-liter V8 is equipped with a supercharger and helps the wagon reach the incredible performance displayed by other Mopar Hellcat variants."

That company is Vigilanti 4x4, an aftermarket restoration company that specializes in these types of vehicles. While the Jeep in question today may just be a rendering, that isn't to say that it won't be available someday. "
