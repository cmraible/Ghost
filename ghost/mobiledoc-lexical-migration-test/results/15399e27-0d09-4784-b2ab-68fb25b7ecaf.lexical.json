This community that we share as car enthusiasts is often contrasted against the overwhelming authoritarianism displayed by the police. In our car culture, the cops are something to be feared and represent everything that tries to take our beloved machines away from us. However, we often forget that within the ranks of the police are people, just as fascinated with high-horsepower behemoths as we are. This deviation from popular belief is best displayed in the case of this monstrous 700+ horsepower Dodge Coronet restomod, being such a cool car that even the cops agree that it's worth letting a ticket slide.",
