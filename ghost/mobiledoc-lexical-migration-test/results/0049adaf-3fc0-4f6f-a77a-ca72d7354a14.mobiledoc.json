While some may find the characters and dialogue to be a little silly, I found it perfectly nonsensical with just the best comedic timing. It sits somewhere in the middle of trying too hard and being super relaxed and chill, leading to quite a unique brand of comedy that I welcome wholeheartedly. It certainly takes some random turns as well, many that you won't expect; I honestly didn't expect to see Jester giving birth on stage and having to hold down the A button to push..."

As previously mention, the aim is to collect flower bouquets in order to win the festival competition. To earn these bouquets, you must perform in the theatre in the genres that are all the rage (and avoid those that are not). While it's not overly complicated, it's light-hearted nature never promised it to be, and the different paths that the shows can be taken will undoubtedly make you chuckle. As you progress, you'll unlock new shows to perform and new stickers for your posters, as well as plot developments that take the story in quite unexpected ways."
