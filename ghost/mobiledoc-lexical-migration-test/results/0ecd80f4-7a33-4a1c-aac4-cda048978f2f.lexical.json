Apparently, this is a bad thing because people might exercise that kind of freedom in the wrong ways. Last time I checked, that’s what law enforcement was for, pulling over people who are speeding and issuing citations. There are other ways to discourage speeding which don't involve government domination. In this utopian society where the government controls the speed of your vehicle, everyone would be forced to obey the law as personal choice is eliminated. Of course, such a move wouldn’t stop at just limiting the top speed of your car, so consider that.",
