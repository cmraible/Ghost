After all, the upstart saved the 6.2-million-square-foot factory, seemingly injecting economic vitality into the northeastern Ohio city at a time when everything seemed to be in freefall. It became a symbol of how the green energy initiative would revitalize the US economy, rising from the supposed ashes of the oil industry."

Lordstown Motors was dealt what could turn out to be a fatal blow on March 1 when it leaked that General Motors divested from the company. This actually happened back in the fourth quarter, with GM selling off its 7.5 million shares."

Before the company went public, it was promising much more robust production figures. Understandably, investors aren’t happy about this anemic push into the market."

During an older interview, he pointed out the Lordstown factory is a high-volume plant, stating he expects to be employing 4,000 to 5,000 soon. \"We think the electric pickup is the new normal,” he said. With “well over several thousand” pre-orders for the Endurance, which starts at $52,500, some think the company still has legs, even without GM’s backing."
