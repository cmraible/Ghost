Built by Troy Gudgel of BBT Fabrications, it hits hard with a 482 twin-turbo Butler Performance Pontiac crate engine and T56 6-speed transmission. There are plenty of interesting details about the car, but the most unique is that even though it was made to work as a street car it can also be used in land-speed racing. Currently, the Firebird is a class record holder for ECTA standing mile at 199.027 mph."
