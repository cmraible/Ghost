Less than 10 seconds after they stepped inside, a Tesla came rocketing down the sidewalk where they were standing. Had they enjoyed their cigarettes a little longer, they would have died while smoking."

Let this be a lesson: when you’re on the open road and you have a lot of ground to cover, don’t keep going if you feel tired. Pull over and rest. West Texas is flat and incredibly boring to drive, just like Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. It’s easy to just drift off in those kinds of conditions, but the results can be deadly."

While it’s possible the driver thought turning that on would allow them to get some shut eye, the simple fact is people fall asleep at the wheel of all kinds of cars all the time. The mistake is made far too often."
