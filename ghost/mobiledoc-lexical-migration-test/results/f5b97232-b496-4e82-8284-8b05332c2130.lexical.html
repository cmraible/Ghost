<p>• <a href="https://thescrum.substack.com/p/the-precarity-election"><strong>The Precarity Election</strong></a> (The Scrum) — <em>“Economic precarity—the elephant in the room neither party addresses with any seriousness—transcends issues of ethnicity, gender, and race for most Americans other than the identity politics set. This has to rank among the truths 2020 has just driven home.”</em></p>

He now has this must-read oped. Read it.</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2020/12/skin-in-the-game-wall-street-student-debt-crisis/"><strong>Skin In The Game</strong></a> (Harper’s) — <em>“Unlike a traditional loan, the ISA was directly tied to Simien’s performance in the labor market—the more money he made, the more money he owed. That stream of income could then be packaged, bundled, and sold to investors, launching Simien into the Rube Goldberg machine of American finance…Students at more than two hundred universities, from New York University to Southern New Hampshire University, have now financed their higher education through ISAs.”</em></p>

While we have been bombarded with evidence of lawlessness taking place right out in the open throughout Trump’s time in office, there is certain to be a mountain of illegal behavior of which we are not aware.

The upshot of this, for the incoming Biden administration, is straightforward: Do not listen to the debt worriers and the deficit hawks. Ignore the calls for means-testing and complicated workarounds. Embrace, instead, the simplicity of cash. Take a page from the left and give as much direct help to as many people as possible.”</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="a-message-from-sirota-"><strong>A message from Sirota:</strong></h4>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>It was a banner week for <em>The Daily Poster</em> — in a 48 hour period this week, we were <a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1328772836857499648?s=20">attacked</a> by GOP operatives at the Lincoln Project, we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-bidens-first-climate-appointment/">broke open</a> the story of Joe Biden appointing an oil ally, we held a subscriber-only <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tonight-live-chat-at-730pm-et-with-c47/">live event</a> with state attorneys general fighting the Trump administration, and we published a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tucker-carlson-and-media-elites-cozy/">major investigative report</a> showing the links between media elites and Wall Street moguls.</p>
<p>All of it proved that we are having a major impact, and we couldn’t do it without support from you. And here’s some good news — we are working on plans to expand our subscriber-only content in the very near future. I can’t yet tell you exactly what we are going to be doing, but I think you are going to like it. Our hope is to have the new offerings out after the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>Speaking of that holiday, for the first time in 7 months, <em>The Daily Poster </em>team is going to take a short break. From the Thursday of Thanksgiving to the following Tuesday, we’re planning to be off. So when you don’t get stuff from us in that time, just know it’s because we are taking a short breather to recharge.</p>
<p>As we head into the winter, it is hard to know how to deploy our limited reporting resources — there’s a pandemic killing thousands of people, there’s an economic crisis, there’s Joe Biden’s new administration and there’s still a slow-motion coup attempt by Donald Trump. It’s hard to keep up — and they are all important stories.</p>
<p>I’ve been somewhat troubled by the nonchalant reaction to Trump’s attempt to overturn the election. Yes, the behavior is almost comically outrageous, and it is easy to laugh at. However, it is not a laughing matter, and I fear it isn’t going to stop on its own.</p>
<p>When I published this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/trump-is-staging-a-coup-why-are-dems/"><em>Daily Poster</em></a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/trump-is-staging-a-coup-why-are-dems/"> piece</a> more than a week ago, some people eye-rolled it as alarmism — but with Trump’s recent escalation this week, it seems that more people are now taking it seriously, which is a good thing. It should be taken seriously — it isn’t funny.</p>
<p>One last thing: I know everyone is tired out and burned out by the pandemic and the isolation. This situation is a major mental health challenge for all of us — but just remember that you are not alone. We are all going through it together, even if we are trapped behind masks and screens.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons we are doing more Daily Poster live chats — so that we can all get some sense of community and connection at a moment when we are all so desperate for it. We plan to have another live chat this Wednesday evening with just subscribers and the Daily Poster team — we’ll try to directly answer as many of your questions as you want to throw at us. We’ll be sending login details soon — so stay tuned for that. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
