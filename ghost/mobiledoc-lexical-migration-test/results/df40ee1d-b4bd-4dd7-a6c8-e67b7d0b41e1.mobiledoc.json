While nothing groundbreaking comes from this standalone sequel to the original 3DS series, the switch brings a solid upgrade in almost every aspect. With a young fisherman castaway, a kingdomless princess, a travelling scholar and his hired mercenary, roam from country to country to recover the four crystals of Musa in hopes to prevent a world-ending cataclysm.

You can build up Brave Points by taking the Default action, putting you in a defensive action with a maximum tally of three points. On the other side of the same coin, you can actually go into a Brave Point deficit of up to minus three which causes you to waste future turns, thus leaving yourself wide open to your enemies’ attacks. The benefit of this is to quickly beat a random encounter while trying to grind out some additional levels and job levels."

A new thought process now goes into choosing equipment instead of just going for the gear with the highest numbers.

Each enemy has their own weaknesses to different weapon types and magic elements and you can swap weapons with no penalty in the items menu during combat if you want to capitalise on those weaknesses. Consecutive battles return to multiply your JP rate depending on how many battles you complete in a row.

Here, your character leaves on a ship, exploring the world while encountering other players’ characters. They’ll find treasures and EXP/JP orbs, providing a way to grind out levels while not playing the game. That being said, all of this is completed via an exploration log which caps out at 12 hour time limits so you can’t just leave the game on sleep mode for several days and expect huge rewards.

This comes with both pros and cons, with the main con being it’s slightly more difficult to grind. I do enjoy the ability to choose at least one of the enemies that will be in the battle, which makes it easier to complete the bestiary, and now you can attempt to strike first to gain the advantage. You can also cut grass in the overworld and in dungeons, you can find money, items or even weapons which can sometimes be more valuable than what is in a chest next to it. I once found 1300pg in grass next to a chest holding only 400pg; safe to say, chests feel almost useless sometimes."

However, the side quests aren't always the clearest to be found with some only being available at night and if they’re inside a building that you have to load into, there are no indications to it. "

Elvis is on an adventure to unlock the mysteries of his missing mentor's book that only reveals more information in the proximity of an asterisk. He is genuinely my favourite character and is a lot of fun to follow around as he goes around doing favours for a pint. Adelle is a mercenary protecting Elvis while he goes around on his journey while she is on the lookout for her missing sister. Rounding out the team with an upbeat personality that plays off Elvis in a cheeky way, these two bring the heart to most scenes. Outside of the main party, there are a wide variety of characters, some being cliche and cheesy while others make valid points for their acts of villainy."
