<p>Under the hood of this high horsepower behemoth of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-dodge-challenger/">1970 Challenger</a> is a monstrous <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-hemi-cars/">Hemi V8 equipped</a> with a 110-mm turbocharger. This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/convertible-dodge-challenger/">Challenger</a> with extremely thick rear tires, a tubed rear end, and a full race spec roll cage, it is impossible to suspect this car as anything less than a full-blown race car. The aforementioned mods are an absolute necessity due to the ridiculously low quarter-mile time and insane horsepower number that this thing pushes out. </p>

<p>Under the hood is a professionally built 6.1-liter Hemi V8. Master engine builder Jimmy Barton started with an aluminum block and filled it with some of the best internals from some of the biggest names on the market, including Bryant Racing, Carrillo, Mahle, Jesel, Comp, and Fast. Supplying the boost is a Precision 110mm turbocharger complete with dual wastegates, and a KBI custom water to air intercooler. Currently, the setup is tuned to the note of 1,000-horsepower running 12-lbs of boost on E85 fuel. </p>
