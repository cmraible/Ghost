<p><strong><em>The digital advertising landscape is changing rapidly, with companies investing more in online PR and content marketing as opposed to outdated SEO and expensive pay per click. Here is a full review of the market leading platforms for online press releases, where we discuss what they’re doing right:</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the impact of <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/11/ftc-releases-advertising-disclosures-guidance-online-influencers">FTC disclosure requirements</a> on the media industry, it makes sense to use an online marketing agency or PR platform with sufficient skills and media contacts to carefully navigate the legal landscape to yield best results and ROI. This happens easily when your agency is well connected and capable of arranging three types of press results, including “editorial” news articles, officially formatted “press releases” and off course other types of influencer marketing such as guest posting. There is a distinct difference between each of the aforementioned news types – something you should know well before mapping out an annual media plan.</p>
<h2>What is a press release?</h2>
<p>A press release is a brief, accurate and informative piece of news information aimed at specific media targets. This includes media owners, journalists and even government agencies that can redistribute the news or investigate if further to add an amplified result to the original content based on their own findings and views. Raising interest from relevant parties requires careful copywriting skills and information as to who, what and where the news title pertains to. It is typically written by citing executive quotes, in the third-person and relevant sources in the form of links.</p>
<h2>How much does a press release cost?</h2>
<p>Press releases are incredibly affordable these days and provide a high ROI. It can shrink the gap between paying $25 000 for one Forbes article, at their advertising department who will mark the content as sponsored, and between $1000 and $4000 to reach a ton of journalists who MAY write for sites like Inc.com, Entrepreneur.com, CNN.com, CBS, NBC, Wired.com, The Harvard Business Review, Mashable, The Economist, The Washington Post, Fox News, and so forth. The only issue is that paid advertising is the ONLY form of press engagement that can be guaranteed, whereas a “press release”, is an unofficial yet powerful backdoor channel where ethical providers will technically not guarantee results. Disruptors like Adriaan Brits the CEO of Sitetrail have used their connections and media wire technology to drive that cost down to as little as $250.</p>
<h2>How do I choose the best press release writing and distribution platform?</h2>
<p>The media connections of the platform owner, coupled with the efficiency of a typical ex-journalist team, is something that drives the best results for the industry. Companies, for example, who make use of offshore writers with no media connections, typically fail to yield good results. Some platforms take care of distribution only, some platforms only do press release writing and formatting – and then off course, a hybrid platform can take care of both writing and distribution, typically in a shorter timeframe as it is all orchestrated from one closely knit team with a streamlined process.</p>
<h2>A review of well-known press release platforms:</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Fiverr.com</h2>
<p>Fiverr is a freelancing platform, not a media owner. It is used by other providers to resell services and adds a 20% commission to all services. It is an impartial observer between buyers and sellers that facilitates any disputes. It is popular with the design and creative community.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pricing: $ varies – </em></strong>All price ranges depending on sellers.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Upwork.com</h2>
<p>Upwork is a freelancing platform where some ex-journalists write. It has a huge problem in terms of quality as the majority of the workforce is located in Asia (India etc.). Although it is huge, it can easily lead to an undesirable PR disaster. The platform may be better for other things such as web design.</p>
<p><strong><em>In-house ex-journalist writers? </em></strong>No.</p>
<p><strong><em>Official platform? </em></strong>No.</p>
<p><strong><em>Media owner? </em></strong>No.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pricing: $ </em></strong>varying prices.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>WPP.com</h2>
<p>WPP is an expensive high-end provider who subs out a lot of work through a complex internal structure. It is a media brand, so companies should expect to pay a premium for it’s services and expensive London & NYC officers. Mark Read is the CEO who took over from Mr. Martin Sorrell</p>
<p><strong><em>In-house ex-journalist writers? </em></strong>Yes. Competent teams and good media connections.</p>
<p><strong><em>Official platform? </em></strong>No, but possibly through it’s complex subsidiaries.</p>
<p><strong><em>Media owner? </em></strong>No, but possibly through it’s complex subsidiaries. It owns several agencies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pricing: $1000+ </em></strong>Expect to pay a premium.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Havas.com</h2>
<p>Havas is a mult-national innovative PR, advertising and marketing firm. It is essentially the competitor to WPP, as another expensive high-end provider. The CEO Yannick Bolloré is rather well connected with the media.</p>
<p><strong><em>In-house ex-journalist writers? </em></strong>Yes. Competent teams and good media connections.</p>
<p><strong><em>Official platform? </em></strong>Unknown</p>
<p><strong><em>Media owner? </em></strong>It is certainly a media owner through complex structures.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pricing: $1000+ </em></strong>Expect to pay a premium.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The final score on press release platforms:</h2>
<p>As demonstrated above, freelancing platforms are muscling in on this space – with only a handful of true hybrid providers that can deliver both innovative writing, alongside press release distribution and syndication. Sitetrail is the price leader coming in at $250 for releases crafted by American writers and a handful of British collaborators at their secondary office in London. Considering that numerous companies compete for this space, it is a healthy market where nobody has a monopoly and ability to abuse their power in the media: albeit that some agency owners are much better connected than others. Given that this space is occupied by Sitetrail, PRWeb / Cision, EIN Newsire, SBWire, WPP, Havas, Upwork, Fiverr, SBNewsire, Send2Press, PR.com and Scripted and PRNewsire, it is easy to see why so many CMO’s choose this as a rout to bypass expensive advertising departments: the likes of Forbes, Entrepreneur and CNN. Ultimately, the best press release platform is the one where writers can pitch an idea that is innovative – and platform owners can get the article accepted by some of the highest traffic news websites to enable viral results.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion:</em></strong></p>
<p>Online PR is an interesting game where massive gains can be made. Press releases are known to have a far greater ROI than pay per click, social media and even email marketing. It can tie in well with all of these channels and is a potent tool for reputation management, product launches and consistent branding. Make sure you understand the difference between “Native content”, “Press releases”, “Editorial News” and “Guest Posts”. Remember that not all agencies and jurisdictions are regulated by the FTC as the world of media stretches beyond America.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/dissertations/5896/">Research confirmed</a> that press releases and online are high-yielding channels of customer acquisition, besides all the obvious reputation benefits that are pursued. Next time someone asks “how do I write a press release?” or “where do I submit a press release?”, it is well worth noting that both these activities can be covered in one step and will save them a lot of time. Most PR service providers are sitting on HUGE media lists so save yourself the time and effort of re-inventing the wheel. Finally: NO. Linkedin is not the most effective way to find media contacts, as they are all inundated with requests from virtual assistants. It pays to hire a professional team with outreach PR.</p>
