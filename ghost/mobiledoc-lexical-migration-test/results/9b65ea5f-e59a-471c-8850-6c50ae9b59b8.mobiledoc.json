          "Young adults today may not realize where Will Smith even came from, they just know he's a household name today. However, anyone born pre-1990s knows that Will Smith was at one time everywhere. You couldn't turn on the television, radio, or go to the movies without seeing (or hearing) the name Will Smith. Depending on how pre-1990s you were, Smith was the big brother you wish you had, or the cool goofy guy you'd want to hang out with in the food court, and he would go on to star in some incredible films as the leading man role. So we have to wonder, of all the money he's amassed from this level of fame, has he spent some of it on a few dream cars? Let's check out his garage. "
