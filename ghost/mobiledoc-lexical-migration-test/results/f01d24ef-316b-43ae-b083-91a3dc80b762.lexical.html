<hr>
<p>Starting with the C4 generation, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/callaway-c7/">Callaway</a> has built some of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2019-hennessey-exorcist-zl1-1le/">most incredible</a> Corvettes to hit the streets. While they haven't offered a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/impress-2020-c8-corvette-z51/">C8 upgrade package</a> yet, they are still hard at work on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/giveaway-c8-corvette/">improving</a> the C7.</p>

<p>Callaway is now <a href="https://www.callawaycars.com/homepage/cars/callaway-corvette/callaway-champion/">offering the Championship Edition package</a> on Z06 Corvettes. Each Championship Edition is fitted with an upgraded suspension, new wheels and a large rear wing, as well as unique exhaust tips.</p>
<p>The package also includes some engine tweaks to transform the already potent Z06 from 650 horsepower to 757. Torque is rated at 777 lb/ft. Are you feeling lucky? Engine upgrades consist of a beefed-up supercharger and a freer-flowing exhaust.</p>

<p>That's enough to drop the stated zero to 60 time to just 2.8 seconds, with the quarter mile flying by in 10.5 seconds. As you may have guessed from the giant wing, the Callaway C7 Z06 Championship Edition is designed, first and foremost, as a track machine. It's good to know that it can still tear things up on a drag strip, too.</p>
