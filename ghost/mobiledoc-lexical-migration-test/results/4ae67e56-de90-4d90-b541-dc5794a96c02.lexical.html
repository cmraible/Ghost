<p>Today's philosophical conundrum: Did the popularity of early SUVs lay the groundwork for the proliferation of modern SUVs, or did the popularity of modern SUVs make classics like <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/31103/1972-chevrolet-blazer-k5?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this 1972 Chevrolet K5 Blazer</a> more popular? It's a chicken/egg scenario for sure, but either way, classic SUVs like the Ford Bronco and Chevy Blazer are red hot in the collector car market right now.</p>

<p>The third generation Plymouth Barracuda, which ran from 1970 to 1975, gets quite a lot of respect in muscle car and collector car circles. In our opinion, the first and <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">second generation cars</a> deserve more attention than they get.</p>
<p><a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851758-1969-Plymouth-Barracuda?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This tastefully modified 1969 Barracuda</a> is a great example of the second generation. Like the first generation (1964-1966), the second generation (1967-1969) shared a lot of its underpinnings with the Valiant</p>

<p>Dropping temperatures and the looming threat of snow (and road salt) has us putting away our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-this-long-lost-72-corvette/">fun cars</a> and thinking about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/rock-or-restore-1972-trans-am/">winter projects</a>.

<p>One of our automotive "guilty pleasures" is the 1977 to 1981 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/restomod-chevy-camaro-lsx/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> Z28. What these cars lacked in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/900-horsepower-ford-sierra-drags-britain/">performance</a>, they most certainly made up for it in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/pumpkin-painted-cars-halloween/">attitude</a>.</p>
<p>The aggressive, hawk-like beak nose was accentuated by a deep airdam, a rear spoiler, and prominent fender flares. In addition, attractive gradient stripes on the side featured large Z28 callouts, while a similar motif drew attention to the hood scoop.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, popularity of the third generation run of the F-Body has seen a surprising spike, but more times than not, it’s the third-gen Camaro that’s getting the spotlight, not the humble Pontiac variant. However, if you look the market on a shorter timeline, you’ll see strong interest in the same year run Pontiac Firebirds, Formulas, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/313204/modern-camaro-trans-am">Trans Ams</a>, and for good reason. This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/181999/1986-pontiac-firebird-trans-am">1986 Pontiac Trans Am</a> is a beautiful example of the generation, as well as the modern classic American market that’s largely underestimated.</p>

<p>We'll readily admit that we're more "car people" than "motorcycle people" here on Motorious. When <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1972-triumph-trackmster-road-racer/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a motorcycle catches our attention</a> and we choose to write about it, you can rest assured that it's worth your attention, too. At least, that's what we think.</p>
