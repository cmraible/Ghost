That means that this highly unique supercar has an avid army of dedicated fans waiting for the chance to get their hands on anything that even slightly resembles this masterpiece. You, on the other hand, may not have to wait as it is currently up for auction, and with an original MSRP of $420,000, you may even be able to get it for a tremendous value as opposed to if you waited to buy.
