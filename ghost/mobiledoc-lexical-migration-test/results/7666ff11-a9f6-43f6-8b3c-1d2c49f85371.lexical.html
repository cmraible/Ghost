<hr>
<p>Few cars are as iconic on the American scene than the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/custom-1955-bel-air-white-abyss-is-a-tri-five-king/">Chevy Tri-Fives</a>. While some people get excited about any of these cars, for many it has to be a two-door and even <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/restored-1957-chevrolet-bel-air-is-a-cool-cruiser/">better if it’s a Bel Air</a>. Not everyone will agree with that assessment, but we’re pretty sure everyone can admire this beautiful custom <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1957-chevrolet-bel-air/">1957 Chevrolet Bel Air</a>.</p>
<p>As a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1962-chevrolet-corvette-roadster-pro-touring/">Pro Touring build</a>, not only have aesthetics been addressed, performance has been prioritized in a big way. More specifically, the garage which built this car, Ironworks Speed & Kustom, dropped an LS9 under the hood for a huge power boost. And for good measure they added a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/supercharged-bullitt-mustang-is-a-beast/">Whipple supercharger</a>.</p>

<p>That in turn meant many upgrades for the Bel Air. The factory hood looks like it would fit the new powertrain, so it was reworked. Fabrication to the rest of the body looks pretty extensive, yet it’s not so dramatic that the classic looks of the Chevy are wiped away.</p>
<p>It features quite a few modern amenities, including comfortable bucket seats and what looks to be a digital gauge cluster. We’re sure this thing rides great and attracts plenty of attention. Really, any Chevy Tri Five can draw stares as it cruises down the road and a crowd when parked, but this one is a standout with all the custom work.</p>

<p>The video shows you bits of the process of transforming this 1957 Chevy Bel Air into a Pro Touring beast. You don’t get all the details, but the builder seems willing to answer any legitimate questions you might have.</p>
<p>A word of warning before you watch the video: the music overlay is a pretty taste-specific. If it’s not your thing, just mute the video and enjoy the build.</p>
