We saw a president and other elected officials incite an armed assault on the U.S. Capitol, and that should live in infamy for the rest of our lives. Unfortunately, there is already an effort to try to downplay it, and make it seem like just another political conflagration that will fade into the ether."

On that horrible day, I was in the Capitol complex and then frantically fled the scene with thousands of others being evacuated. The scene was terrifying — and I am sure many people who were at the Capitol this week were similarly traumatized by the chaos and the violence."

We are working on some reporting that recounts how this was a culmination of many events and trends that have been fueling a right-wing assault on our democracy. So don’t let anyone tell you that this was some spontaneous anomaly — it wasn’t, and the idea that it was is a dishonest ruse to try to downplay what’s really going on."
