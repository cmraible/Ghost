This approach goes well beyond people swapping out the BMW straight-six powerplant for a 2JZ because it adds almost twice the cylinders and dials things up well beyond ridiculous."

The included video of this car on the dyno shows how extreme the build is as the motor and exhaust scream like an eagle on fire about to divebomb a rhinoceros into oblivion."

You see in the video it’s proven on the dyno, it’s pushing 630-horsepower at the rear wheels. In the day and age where there are three-row crossovers with more power at their wonton disposal, that might not sound like much. And that really demonstrates how crazy the horsepower wars of today have become. What a time to be alive."

Tuerck hasn’t treated us to that yet, but he did release a cool trailer-like video of the MKV Supra at play drifting on some rural road. That allows us to hear what the car sounds like outside of a building and it’s quite glorious."
