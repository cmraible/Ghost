Everything from the straight body line above the rear fender to the vinyl top made this car incredibly controversial in the automotive enthusiast community. Some people would say it's not for them, but those who appreciate the car for its refined beauty understand just how unique these cars are. That's precisely why it's so cool to see this car running around the streets of Los Angeles boasting a flamboyant exhaust note unlike any other Cougar in the mainstream.",

Of course, if we're talking about the rear tires, then you'll notice that the stock road tires have been replaced with a set of borderline drag radials. All you need to know about the suspension setup can be summed up with two words, drag racing! This is evident when the driver steps on the gas as the car's nose lift off the ground and nearly does a wheelie on the street. Calling this car fast would be a drastic understatement because of the sheer power and raw acceleration, making it what it is today.",

The owner did not see many cars like his in mainstream car culture, so he decided to flip the scripts on all the small blocks and Coyote swaps. That is what led him to drop in that massive big-block V8 and what made the car such an iconic piece of automotive mastery. Of course, this all can be boiled down by saying that this car is the epitome of American Rock and Roll counterculture.",
