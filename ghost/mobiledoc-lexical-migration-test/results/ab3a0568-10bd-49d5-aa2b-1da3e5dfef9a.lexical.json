For one, the Nintendo Switch has sold 32.37 million units, having sold 14.49 million units sold in the last quarter. Also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nintendo Switch software sales at 163.61 million</li>\n<li>Nintendo 3DS has sold 74.84 million units</li>\n<li>Nintendo 3DS software sales at 375.97 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For last fiscal year, Nintendo set the goal at 20 million switch units sold. However for the next fiscal year, they&#8217;ve surprisingly estimated 17 million units. Perhaps that means that Nintendo don&#8217;t have much planned for 2019 &#8211; Hopefully not.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Does this install confidence in your purchase of a Nintendo Switch?
