<p>Good things are happening! The California Senate passes a bill to divest public pensions from fossil fuels, and for the first time ever, investments in solar energy projects have overtaken oil on a global scale. What‚Äôs more, <em>The New York Times</em> union gets a deal, airline regulators do their job, and the environmental regulators address centuries of toxic waste.</p>

<h3 id="california-makes-strides-on-divestment">California Makes Strides On Divestment</h3>
<p>On Thursday, the California Senate passed a <a href="https://sd33.senate.ca.gov/sites/sd33.senate.ca.gov/files/sb_252_the_fossil_fuel_divestment_act_fact_sheet.pdf">bill</a> to divest the country‚Äôs two largest public pensions from fossil fuels, with momentous support. The bill will now move to the Assembly, and could take effect by January 2024.</p>
<p>Currently, the two impacted funds ‚Äî the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) ‚Äî collectively <a href="https://stand.earth/press-releases/california-divestment-bill-passes-senate-2023/">hold</a> over $44 billion in fossil fuels. That means billions in state employees‚Äô retirement dollars are tied to the success of projects that are causing global <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/">fatalities</a> and climate catastrophe. The bill would require the funds to divest from all existing fossil fuel investments by 2030.</p>
<p>The bill, authored by Sen. Lena Gonzalez (D), has support from over 140 organizations including unions representing 470,000 members, although it‚Äôs also faced <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/calpers-fossil-fuel-divestment-bill-hinges-on-union-support">hesitance</a> and <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/california-state-senate-passes-calpers-calstrs-fossil-fuel-divestment-bill/">pushback</a> from some legislators, pension fund leaders, and union members. Divestment is a growing trend: Pension funds in New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., ¬†and elsewhere internationally have already done some level of divestment. On the brink of becoming the world‚Äôs fourth-largest economy, California‚Äôs financial decisions have global impact.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill <a href="https://www.siliconvalley.com/2023/01/12/california-storm-losses-estimated-at-more-than-30-billion/">cite</a> the <a href="https://www.siliconvalley.com/2023/01/12/california-storm-losses-estimated-at-more-than-30-billion/">nearly</a> $30 billion in climate damages that California has faced in 2023 alone, plus the growing severity of droughts and wildfire, as reasons to divest, and suggest that this strategy could actually be more profitable for the pension.</p>
<p>The California legislature seems serious about climate action. Another newly proposed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB556">bill</a> in California could be the <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052023/california-oil-wells-health-penalty/">first</a> legislation in the nation to make oil and gas companies pay direct compensation for harm to human health. Owners of oil or gas production facilities would be legally liable for health outcomes like respiratory disease in children and elders, preterm birth or high risk pregnancies, and certain cancer diagnoses, and would have to pay victims up to $1 million in penalties.</p>
<h3 id="the-times-says-it%E2%80%99s-time-for-a-deal">The Times Says It‚Äôs Time For A Deal</h3>
<p>After two years of negotiations and a 24-hour strike, The <em>New York Times‚Äô</em> union <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/business/media/new-york-times-news-guild-contract.html">agreed</a> to a new contract deal on Tuesday. The 1,500-member union represents security guards, advertisers, and other staffers as well as journalists at the newspaper. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTimesGuild/status/1661171608533311488">thread</a> on Twitter, the Times Guild called the agreement ‚Äúgroundbreaking.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis will be the most robust contract we‚Äôve ever had and will set a new industry standard,‚Äù the thread continued.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>If ratified, the deal will raise the minimum salary requirement from $37,500 to $65,000 while increasing salaries across the board, and give union members four weeks of paid sabbatical for every 10 years at the company. Workers only need to work sixty years to get six months off!</p>
<p>The Times doesn‚Äôt have the best <a href="__GHOST_URL__/otherposts/you-love-to-see-it-progressive-caucus-takes-a-stand-2/">track</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/01/leaked-messages-new-york-times-anti-union-strategy">record</a> on union support, and this deal comes two full years after the last contract expired. Still, in a corporate media landscape hollowed out by private equity and high dollar investors, the contract could pave the way for other media enterprises to fight for better deals.</p>

<h3 id="solar-out-powers-oil">Solar Out-Powers Oil</h3>
<p>For the first time ever, solar energy investments have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/solar-power-due-overtake-oil-production-investment-first-time-iea-2023-05-25/">overtaken</a> oil, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2023/overview-and-key-findings">according</a> to the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>In 2023, global investments in solar power projects will amount to $382 billion, while oil production will come in at $371 billion.</p>
<p>Renewable energy is making gains across the board: Of the $2.8 trillion to be invested globally in energy by the end of the year, $1.7 trillion will go to renewables, nuclear energy, electric vehicles, and other efficiency measures. That‚Äôs nearly a 25 percent increase since 2021, significantly outpacing the 15 percent increase in fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel investments shouldn‚Äôt be increasing at all, and they‚Äôre still at least <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/05/25/energy/solar-investment-to-outpace-oil-first-time/index.html">twice</a> what they should be for us to‚Ä¶ mitigate the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/oct/14/climate-change-happening-now-stats-graphs-maps-cop26">apocalypse</a>? Plus, investments in solar and other renewables are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/solar-power-due-overtake-oil-production-investment-first-time-iea-2023-05-25/">disproportionately</a> located in wealthy ¬†countries, leaving out and sometimes directly <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/07/on-the-frontlines-of-climate-change/">harming</a> the communities most at risk of climate catastrophe. Still, trends toward a renewable takeover and increased reliance on solar energy could help curb emissions in the coming years. And that we love to see.</p>
<h3 id="department-of-justice-breaks-up-colluding-airlines">Department of Justice Breaks Up Colluding Airlines</h3>
<p>Last Friday, a federal judge <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/justice-department-wins-lawsuit-to-undo-jetblue-american-airlines-northeast-partnership.html">ordered</a> American Airlines and JetBlue Airways to end their Northeast partnership on the grounds that it stifles competition at the expense of accessible prices and customer service.</p>
<p><em>The Lever </em>has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/news-the-airlines-are-finally-being-investigated/">reported</a> continuously on federal reticence around airline regulations, and the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-how-the-airline-industry-became-a-living-nightmare/">dangers</a> of the country‚Äôs steady march toward an airline monopoly. This lawsuit, won by the Department of Justice (DOJ), is a big blow to corporate power. Combine that with the Department of Transportation‚Äôs <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-new-yorks-green-new-deal/">baby steps</a> on airline regulation earlier this month, and it‚Äôs possible change is coming.</p>
<p>The DOJ lawsuit was filed in 2021, claiming that the two companies were raising prices and reducing service in the northeast, at the expense of customers seeking low-cost travel options. The airlines have 30 days to end the partnership, though both airlines are unhappy with the decision and will probably fight back.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs decision is a win for Americans who rely on competition between airlines to travel affordably,‚Äù <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/justice-department-wins-lawsuit-to-undo-jetblue-american-airlines-northeast-partnership.html">said</a> U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Justice Department will continue to protect competition and enforce our antitrust laws in the heavily consolidated airline industry and across every industry.‚Äú</p>

<h3 id="epa-to-close-loophole-on-centuries-of-toxic-waste">EPA To Close Loophole On Centuries Of Toxic Waste</h3>
<p>The EPA is proposing tightened <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coalash/proposed-changes-legacy-coal-combustion-residuals-surface-impoundments-and-ccr-management">regulations</a> for coal ash, the highly toxic waste that comes from burning coal.</p>
<p>Published as a draft rule last week, the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/18/2023-10048/hazardous-and-solid-waste-management-system-disposal-of-coal-combustion-residuals-from-electric">proposal</a> would close a huge loophole left by 2015 <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/17/2015-00257/hazardous-and-solid-waste-management-system-disposal-of-coal-combustion-residuals-from-electric">regulations</a> from the Obama administration, which called for safe disposal of coal ash at new and existing facilities, but excluded all plants that were already closed. Since U.S. industries have been burning coal for two centuries, that loophole left out <a href="https://earthjustice.org/feature/coal-ash-map-sites-legacy-inactive-regulated">hundreds</a> of facilities. Nearly half of all coal ash ever produced in the country wasn‚Äôt covered by the rule, including waste lingering in landfills, retired power plants, and other highly toxic sites, many of which are located in low-income communities of color.</p>
<p>Coal ash contains pollutants linked to cancer, heart disease, reproductive failure, and other severe health issues. What‚Äôs more, 91 percent of existing and retired coal plants that are currently being monitored are <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04032019/coal-ash-groundwater-contamination-toxic-arsenic-memphis-texas-eip/">actively</a> polluting groundwater at unsafe levels. Last year, journalists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1065214649/in-orlando-a-mountain-of-coal-ash-evades-epa-rules-its-not-the-only-one">exposed</a> the regulatory loophole and Earthjustice <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25082022/earthjustice-is-suing-epa-over-coal-ash-dumps-which-leak-toxins-into-groundwater/">sued</a> the EPA, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21052023/epa-regulations-coal-ash/">leading</a> to the settlement that brought this proposal.</p>
<p>If you want to weigh in and tell the EPA that you are also against hazardous toxins, they‚Äôre <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coalash/proposed-changes-legacy-coal-combustion-residuals-surface-impoundments-and-ccr-management">taking</a> public comment on the proposal until July 17.</p>

<p><strong>Shiv Soin </strong>is co-founder of <a href="https://www.treeageteam.org/">TREEage</a>, a youth climate justice organization in New York City fighting for state and local climate justice legislation and a Green New Deal. As a 19-year-old college student in 2019, Shiv was the lead organizer for New York‚Äôs 315,000 person youth climate <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/thousands-young-activists-challenging-lawmakers-act-global-climate/story?id=65716650">strike</a>, coordinating with an international movement of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/climate/global-climate-strike.html">millions</a> of students demanding immediate governmental action on the climate crisis.</p>
<p>After the strike, Shiv was determined to harness its momentum into a lasting movement, so he co-founded TREEage and has been organizing high school and college students throughout the city for almost four years using a combination of lobbying, direct action, outreach, and coalition building. The organization, now with over 250 members, has been deeply involved in the implementation of <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/sustainablebuildings/ll97/local-law-97.page">Local Law 97</a>, New York‚Äôs landmark regulation on building emissions, and they fought alongside partner organizations for the Build Public Renewables Act and the All Electric Buildings Acts in this year‚Äôs <a href="__GHOST_URL__/you-love-to-see-it-new-yorks-green-new-deal/">budget</a>.</p>
