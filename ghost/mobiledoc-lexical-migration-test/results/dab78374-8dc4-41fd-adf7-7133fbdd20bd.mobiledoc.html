<p>Hey everyone…</p>
<p>As part of the subscriber-only Weekend Reading List, I’m going to start writing a short note at the top here just to give you a few personal thoughts. If you don’t want to read these thoughts, you’ll always be able to scroll down past this note to the regular Weekend Reading List which will always be attached below.</p>
<p>It’s been a tough few months for everyone other than the billionaires — I’ve felt torn between work and having the kids at home and trying to stay sane through these insane times. I don’t have much in the way of suggested coping strategies — except trying to be outside for a few hours at least once a week, as Nick Kristof <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/22/opinion/sunday/hiking-wilderness-montana.html">suggested</a> in his recent column. Here’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1299106243735298048">photo</a> I snapped while doing that this week — it was great. I also decided to take the plunge and splurge on a Nintendo Classic, so we are now <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1299751750958608385?s=20">playing</a> some of the old games from my childhood. You do what you gotta do to get through this.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the fascism we saw on display last week at the GOP convention and in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/08/27/Fox-s-Tucker-Carlson-takes-heat-for-Kenosha-commentary/stories/202008270182">valorization</a> of a gunman in Kenosha. I’m working on an essay about it that I’m aiming to publish this coming week.</p>
<p>Also coming this week will be a big climate story from California as well as a new special feature that we’re calling Flashback. As you may know, I cannot stand our media culture that encourages us to forget our entire world every 15 minutes. So this new periodic feature will resurface excerpts of old stories and documents that can help contextualize some of the current news. I think you’re gonna like the first one we have for you.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for pitching in to support this newsletter project. I hope you can see by all the clips how hard we are working every single day — and we wouldn’t be able to do that work without your support. Please email me directly or use the comments at the bottom of this post to give me any feedback about the newsletter.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
