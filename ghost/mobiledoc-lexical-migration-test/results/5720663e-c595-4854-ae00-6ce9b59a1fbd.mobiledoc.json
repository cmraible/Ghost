Everything from the paint to the wheels to the undercarriage is spotless on this car, and the black Nappa leather interior shows no sign of wear. Bottom line, this car is a flashback to 1994 right down to the period-correct BMW-branded car phone!"

If that wasn't good enough, this particular car squeezes even more performance from the V12 engine with a Dinan performance chip and Racing Dynamics performance exhaust system. Matching its exclusive engine, the 850CSi had a distinctive appearance thanks to sportier front and rear bumpers as well as staggered-width 17-inch wheels."
