<hr>
<p>Rich Weissensel is a bit of a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/DeLorean">DeLorean</a> nut. Not only does the guy love the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">cars</a> and own several, he’s turned many of them into some of the wildest vehicles you could imagine. Among his collection of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/DeLorean/DMC-12">DeLorean DMC-12s</a> is a monster truck, a stretch limousine, and a hovercraft.</p>
<p>In the video below you get to see these creations in action. Yes, they’re not just movie set pieces which look like they work, these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/delorean-dmc-12-remake-rumors-still-going/">DeLoreans</a> can actually off-road, hover no top of water, and more. Each one is a functional piece of automotive art, fascinating people of all ages.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most iconic of Weissensel’s creations is a Time Machine Replica. It looks pretty good and would fool pretty much anyone who saw it, which considering all the detailed modifications used on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/quarantine-car-movies/">movie cars</a> is really saying something.</p>
<p>Weissensel is a software engineer – not exactly the kind of guy who’d expect to build all kinds of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/martykhan-watch-a-driverless-delorean/">wild vehicles</a>. But he’s been reworking the stainless steel bodies for the past 14 years and has become quite good at it. It all started when he met John DeLorean himself at a car show. Weissensel had some sketches for DeLorean builds he showed the man who liked them. The rest is history.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is a fan of what Weissensel does. Some are purists who think cars should be maintained in their original state. While that’s a perfectly respectable stance to take, it’s also unimaginative and not much fun. Constantly tuning and tinkering with cars is a legitimate way to express your appreciation for a certain model. But, as they say, to each his own.</p>

<p>Those naysayers should know Weissensel has a code of conduct. The man only tinkers with DeLoreans that have been wrecked. So he’s not cutting into one that’s still in <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/390578/delorean-barn-find">pristine or even ok condition</a>, leaving those to the people with less imagination.</p>
