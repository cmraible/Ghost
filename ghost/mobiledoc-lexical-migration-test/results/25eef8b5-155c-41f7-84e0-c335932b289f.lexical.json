Finding one's dream car in a chaotic state and slowly bringing it back to life to return to or surpass the car's original glory is a highly appealing thought. Some go even as far as to base their livelihoods around these automotive adventures as they travel from town to town looking for the subsequent significant discovery of a time long forgotten. This video perfectly encapsulates that passion for recovering the historical automobiles that grace the hallowed halls of this old storage warehouse.",

Another cool classic that sits near these automotive legends is a W30 clone which needs a new interior but is mostly complete. In front of the W30, you'll find a 1953 Oldsmobile Convertible, which seems to hold a special place in the owner's heart as he will not be selling the beautiful vintage Oldsmobile. The final cars that we'll show you in this part of the barn are a 1957 Oldsmobile Super 88 Convertible and a 1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass, which boasts a 455 ci V8 under the hood.",

The exterior blue has been covered in an aged patina but seems to be a very sound automobile from looking at it. Thankfully the convertible top is brand new, which allows this straight-body GM masterpiece to remain intact and capable of taking on the weather in most conditions. While we aren't sure what the new owner intends to do with the car, it seems like the vehicle is going into good hands, and we hope to follow its progression from a junkyard bound vintage to a show-stopping classic shortly.",
