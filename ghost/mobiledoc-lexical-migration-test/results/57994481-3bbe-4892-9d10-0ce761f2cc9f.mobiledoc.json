While that might technically be true, at least for now, there have been numerous attempts to restrict the use of motorcycles on public roads in the recent past. Some of these bike bans have been successful and others have been rolled back or never went into effect. However, these attempts seem to be happening more frequently, so the likelihood some will stick also increases."

While motorcycles aren’t mentioned in the plan, for many riders it’s obvious this will be used to enforce only all-electric bikes will be allowed on public roads. Thanks to packaging constraints, electrifying anything with two wheels to be ridden longer distances is problematic."

A study done by the Federation of European Motorcyclists’ Associations (FEMA) revealed last fall indicated 92.91% of respondents were not in favor of such a ban. That might be shocking to those who live in highly urban areas and only associate with those who don’t ride, which is part of the problem. Many of the bans which have gone into effect or are being considered aren’t being influenced in the least by people who actually own motorcycles."

This ban ostensibly was about noise pollution, with some trying to figure out how to reduce the noise of all bikes to nothing more than what a lawnmower or passing truck would emit. I know everyone’s excited to ride a two-wheeled lawnmower. Enthusiasts weren’t happy, so they took to the streets in big numbers with 5,000 joining into a protest in Friedrichshafen and 8,000 in Stuttgart."

Some thought it was too much, but city brass claimed the focus on two-wheeled vehicles came about because they were being used to commit violent crime. People were understandably confused about what the true reasons for making the video were, considering many of the vehicles featured in it could have been resold and used legitimately. Going after motorcycles seems like an easy way for politicians to look like they’re being tough on crime because of the perception that nobody will care."

Even more notable is the fact the Chinese Communist Party has used motorcycle bans in certain parts of China as a coercive tool. Usually, these bans have been justified by the government as a way to save lives since motorcycle crashes are more likely to be fatal. Of course, the more ubiquitous nature of bikes are a primary form of transportation in that area of the world changes what a ban does, but this does show nowhere seems to be immune to the idea of wanting to tell people they can’t ride motorcycles or at least certain types of motorcycles in specified places."
