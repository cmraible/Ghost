<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KqBJb/s3/pristine-1962-chevrolet-corvette-is-a-ncrs-top-flight-winner.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Pristine 1962 Chevrolet Corvette Is A NCRS Top Flight Winner" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>This award is very prestigious for Corvette owners as it signifies the originality and overall quality of the car. While many people throw around the term "no. 1" condition a little too much these days, this condition rating – reserved for concours-quality vehicles – applies to NCRS Top Flight Corvettes. To receive such a rating, Corvettes are meticulously judged to rule out flaws, inaccuracies or counterfeits. NCRS has three award categories with the Top Flight representing the best of the best.</p>
<p>And this '62 Corvette is definitely the best of the best. As expected from a Top Flight award winner, both the white paint job and red interior are flawless, and this color combination is a throwback to the original 1953 'Vette. Under the hood is the numbers-matching, 300-horsepower 327 CID V8 backed by the original two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission. This is a removable-hardtop-only Corvette as it was not equipped with the soft top.</p>

<p>The 1962 model year marked the end of the road for the C1 Corvette, and this generation is still the purest when it comes to style and driving enjoyment. If you're in the market for a classic C1 Corvette, you'd better act fast as these NCRS Top Flight winners don't pop up for sale very often. The current list price is $65,000, but you can click HERE to make an offer on this flawless, award-winning car.</p>
