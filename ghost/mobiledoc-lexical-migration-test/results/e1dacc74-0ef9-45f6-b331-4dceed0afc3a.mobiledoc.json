Rather, it was not even that far away from the dealership and was left unoccupied. This has led a lot of people to many questions regarding what kind of person steals three classic cars and leaves one of them so obviously close to the crime scene with no trace of the other two cars."

On top of that, the man responsible for the vehicle said he was selling it for a measly $10,000. when further pushed, it turned out that he didn't have the title and the car was nowhere in sight leading authorities to believe they had drawn a dead end. Of course, that didn't stop them from pursuing this particular Outlet further and what they found was rather shocking. First, they figured out who this guy was In the chase."

Indeed, this seemed to be the very vehicle and the authorities were quick to jump on this opportunity. On top of that, the Buick Regal was found in a parking lot of a church in the Lincoln Park area. Needless to say, an arrest warrant is in progress for the man behind all of this mystery and hopefully, justice will be served soon enough."
