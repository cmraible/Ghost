Immediately, they called police, who showed up with cadaver dogs, expecting to find the worst. Instead, all they discovered in the interred vehicle were bags of concrete mix, leaving everyone mystified."

As reports flooded in, aerial footage of the dig didn’t help shed light on just what kind of car was buried in the yard. The only thing known at first was that the vehicle was large, perhaps a full-size sedan or an SUV. Police believed it was hidden back in the 1990s under between 4 and 5 feet of dirt for reasons unknown."

One might expect to find a car buried in some seedy area, a couple of dead bodies in the trunk, but not left underground at a mansion with unused bags of cement inside. The whole thing was just weird."
