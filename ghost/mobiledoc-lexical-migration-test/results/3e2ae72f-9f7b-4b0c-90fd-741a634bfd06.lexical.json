This new guy's name was Kikos Fonseca, reportedly Méndez'sMéndez's co-driver who had worked closely with him and the car. So it only makes sense that Fonseca immediately began showing off the vehicle to the people of South and Central America to any onlookers with a passion for speed. Somewhere down the line, this car gained entry back to the states with owner David Hall where it competed with a ton of other racing adventures with countless drivers over the years.

Handling was a significant concern when building this car which is very prevalent when observing the suspension system, which boasts such features as the Eibach Coilovers and springs.
