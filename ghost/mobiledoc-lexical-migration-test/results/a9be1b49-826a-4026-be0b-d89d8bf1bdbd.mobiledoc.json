While we call them barn finds, these diamonds in the rough are often in other buildings, including garages. That’s where Jerry Battaglia found this 1955 Chevy Bel Air, just sitting in a garage he drove past."

Pulling into the driveway, he asked a man there is the car was available. That’s a pretty gutsy move since in some areas you might be picking buckshot out of yourself and your car for weeks after."

A lot of people would’ve just given up once buying the car became difficult. Others would’ve just been forceful and blown up the negotiations quickly. Being aggressive but not overbearing in these types of situations is key and it takes considerable skill."

But this is by far not the most difficult barn find extraction we’ve ever seen. After all, they could get the trailer right up to the garage door and the car rolls, so there’s that. Check it out for yourself."
