<hr>
<p>If 10 years ago we’d been told that a factory Dodge muscle car would be cranking out over 800-horsepower we would’ve been astounded, but here we are. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</a> is a truly wild machine which has taken down <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-dodge-demon-race-classic-muscle-cars/">an impressive array of other vehicles</a> on the drag strip. However, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-dodge-demon-drag-race/">extreme muscle car</a> has its work cut out for it with this supercharged 2019 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/liberty-walk-twin-turbo-lamborghini-huracan-breathes-fire/">Lamborghini Huracan</a> Performante.</p>
<p>This Lambo gets its forced induction setup from VF Engineering. With that extra force feeding, the owner says the Italian-German supercar is pushing 840-hp. That means it has a slight power advantage over the Demon and its 808-hp.</p>
<p>However, there are more differences between these cars. The Dodge Demon has been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/combine-harvester-drag-races/">built specifically for drag racing</a> with a number of systems to help ensure it hooks up and tears down the strip in a hurry. However, you can’t deny that the Challenger body is just slightly more aerodynamic than a brick, especially when compared to the Huracan Performante and how it knifes through the air.</p>
<p>There’s another big difference between these two cars: weight. The Lamborghini is a lot lighter, tipping the scale at just 3,335 pounds thanks to all kinds of composite parts. Meanwhile, the American muscle car is far portlier at 4,255 pounds.</p>
<p>We’re also going to ding the Mopar for having the front splitter guard still attached. It’s a little thing and yet is so controversial, but it’s not helping with curb weight or aerodynamics. Meanwhile the Lambo has all-wheel drive, which if the driver understands the car well enough can be a huge advantage for a clean and quick launch.</p>
<p>Before you watch the video, which car do you think <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tuned-c8-corvette-race-stock-lamborghini/">will win this drag race</a>? Will it be hardcore American muscle clenching the victory or will European exotic finesse and advanced technologies win out?</p>
