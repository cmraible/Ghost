          "Just like in May of last year, GM won’t disclose what component(s) has lead to the complete shutdown of car assembly in Bowling Green. And just like last year, the automaker is denying the offending part is microchip related. Considering all kinds of raw materials which used to be plentiful are now constrained, and numerous automotive parts manufacturers have had trouble with their production as a result, it could be almost anything. There’s also the possibility Russia or some other nation hacked a supplier’s computer network, like what happened to Toyota recently. Since GM isn’t being forthcoming, and we’re sure the company has its reasons, we’re left guessing."

And even though production at Bowling Green Assembly started at the beginning of this week, there are plans to add more positions in April to increase Corvette production. Considering production shutdowns have plagued the C8 starting with the UAW strike in 2019, there are a lot of people who are anxiously awaiting their turn to own the mid-engine American sports car."
