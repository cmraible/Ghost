<p>Welcome to TechieBytes episode 80 titled <em>What's wrong with customer service and how can we fix it? (feat. Joseph Ansanelli)</em></p>
<p>Today I'm speaking with <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radically-personal/id1496838533">Joseph Ansanelli</a>, he's the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://gladly.com/">Gladly</a>, a company that helps brands like Crate & Barrel, UGG, and Warby Parker improve customer service. He's also a venture partner at <a href="https://greylock.com/">Greylock</a>. We discuss what is means to provide great customer service and how companies should be thinking about their customer service experience. Plus we dive into what entrepreneurs should know about pitching and selling their companies. Enjoy!</p>
<p>I've also started a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/building-the-south-florida-entrepreneur-club/">South Florida Entrepreneur Club</a> along with my new friend (whom I met on Clubhouse), Nicholas Mohnacky (@mohnacky on CH)! If you're an entrepreneur in Florida (or anywhere around the world) be sure to follow me on Clubhouse (@jeffweisbein) and join us every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3PM ET!
