<p>Good things are happening! The Supreme Court upheld a crucial section in the Voting Rights Act, the EPA is reversing its own bad policies from the Trump era, NYC doctors staged their first strike in thirty years, Southern judges deliver rare rulings in favor of trans rights, and more.</p>
<h3 id="supreme-court-does-the-right-thing-for-once">Supreme Court Does The Right Thing For Once</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Thursday to protect the rights of Black voters in Alabama, protecting one of the last remaining voting-rights safeguards, and everyone is shocked.</p>
<p>In Alabama, racist <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/voting-rights/alabamas-new-electoral-lines-are-racially-gerrymandered-heres-why">gerrymandering</a> has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/08/1181002182/supreme-court-voting-rights">ensured</a> that only one out of seven congressional districts holds a large enough Black population to elect a Black candidate. Last <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4040446-roberts-kavanaugh-side-with-liberal-justices-in-alabama-voting-rights-victory/">year</a>, a three-judge court ruled that the map likely violated the Voting Rights Act, but the Supreme Court put the ruling on hold long enough to let Alabama Republicans win six congressional seats. Now they’ve changed their tune, and this week’s ruling upholds Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, calling for a new, representative map including a second majority Black district.</p>
<p>Alabama <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-upholds-section-2-of-voting-rights-act/">argued</a> that its maps were “race-neutral,” and if the court had agreed with this logic it would have left a big opening for other states to do even more gerrymandering. But Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the liberal justices in voting to uphold the Voting Rights Act, emphasized that the Act requires political processes to be “equally open” to minority voters in effect, not intent. That means it doesn’t matter whether or not a state intends to be racist if the outcome is a racist map.</p>
<p>The ruling is surprising, since conservative justices have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-arizona-voting-voting-rights-race-and-ethnicity-1a63621d6ebaa55e5ebae6c1fd02ae09">dismantling</a> voting rights, previously <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10324#:~:text=On%20June%2027%2C%202019%2C%20the,from%20the%20federal%20court's%20purview.">ruled</a> against preventing partisan gerrymandering, and gave oral arguments for this case in October that seemed to hint that the decision would go the other way. Section 2 is one of the <a href="http://vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/10/2/23377432/supreme-court-alabama-merrill-milligan-racial-gerrymandering-voting-rights-act">few</a> remaining protections against gerrymandered maps, so this is a surprise we love to see.</p>
<h3 id="epa-vs-chemical-industry">EPA vs. Chemical Industry</h3>
<p>On May 24, the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-05/Pyrolysis%20Proposed%20Provision%20Withdrawal%20Notice_%20ADMIN%2BDISC.pdf">reversed</a> a Trump-era decision on plastic processing, closing a major loophole that allowed the chemical industry to pass off toxic disposal as sustainable recycling.</p><!--members-only-->
<p><em>The Lever </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/forever-chemicals-makers-hid-dangers-for-decades/">reported</a> this week on the plastic industry’s decades-long campaign to hide plastic toxicity, and we’ve also <a href="__GHOST_URL__/as-the-midwest-burns-biden-ignores-plastic-waste-dangers/">covered</a> the Biden administration’s previous inaction on plastic waste. This EPA move suggests a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The decision <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/03062023/epa-pyrolysis-plastic-recycling-clean-air/">focuses</a> on two chemical processes for breaking down plastic –– gasification and pyrolysis –– that use high heat to convert plastics into tar, oil, gas, or char, a substance consisting of carbon, moisture, and ash. For most of the past thirty years, both processes were classified as incineration, making them highly regulated under the Clean Air Act. But in 2020, the EPA issued a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/31/2020-17730/standards-of-performance-for-new-stationary-sources-and-emission-guidelines-for-existing-sources">proposal</a> to make them an exception to the regulations.</p>
<p>The chemical industry has lobbied to make gasification and pyrolysis seem like “clean” recycling, but studies <a href="https://www.no-burn.org/wp-content/uploads/Waste-Gasification-and-Pyrolysis-high-risk-low-yield-processes-march-2017.pdf">show</a> the facilities’ emissions are comparable to traditional trash incinerators, and create toxic carcinogens and byproducts like dioxins and mercury, polluting air and groundwater.</p>
<p>Though it’s not the end of the road, the EPA decision is a win for environmental groups who have been fighting to address the continuing <a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/global-plastic-waste-set-to-almost-triple-by-2060.htm">growth</a> of the plastic industry and its subsequent toxic waste.</p>
<h3 id="nyc-doctors-go-on-strike">NYC Doctors Go On Strike</h3>
<p>More than 150 medical residents at a hospital in Queens, New York went on a three-day <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/06/elmhurst-hospital-queens-residents-doctors-strike/">strike</a> last week, marking the first strike by hospital doctors in NYC in over thirty years. The strike is already inspiring other healthcare workers in the city to demand better working conditions, and could put pressure on an industry that prioritizes profits over patient care and workers’ rights. The strike ended last Wednesday after reaching a tentative deal with Elmhurst Hospital Center.</p>
<p>The deal includes an 18 percent wage increase over three years, a $2,000 ratification bonus, an agreement to negotiate hazard pay, particularly in the event of another pandemic-level disaster, and a meal allowance.</p>
<p>It’s not everything the doctors asked for, but Elmhurst resident and union leader Dr. Tanathun Kajornsakchai <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/nyregion/doctors-strike-elmhurst-hospital.html">told</a><em>The New York Times</em> the strike got the residents “more than [they] would have gotten otherwise.”</p>
<p>Elmhurst was one of the first hospitals in the country to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/nyregion/coronavirus-queens-corona-jackson-heights-elmhurst.html">overwhelmed</a> by the pandemic in 2020, with a high influx of low-income and undocumented patients and skyrocketing COVID-19 cases. Although it is a publicly run hospital, Elmhurst’s residents are employed by Icahn School of Medicine, part of New York’s largest private hospital network, the nonprofit Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai has an annual <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/facts">revenue</a> of $11.3 billion, while striking Elmhurst residents — many of whom are immigrants, and who make $7,000 less annually than their Manhattan counterparts — <a href="https://www.cirseiu.org/mount-sinai-physicians-who-work-at-elmhurst-hospital-set-to-strike-next-week/">said</a> they are struggling to pay rent. Nationally, nearly <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/most-medical-residents-dissatisfied-their-compensation-here-s-how-much-more-they-want-to#:~:text=About%20six%20in%2010%20medical,resident%20salary%20and%20debt%20report.">half</a> of medical residents have over $200,000 in medical school debt.</p>
<p>Medical <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/5/22/23733479/elmhurst-doctors-strike-protesting-pay-gap">residents</a> at two other Mount Sinai campuses and <a href="https://www.nysna.org/press/2023/996-percent-nysna-nurses-newyork-presbyterian-brooklyn-methodist-hospital-authorize#.ZGu3d-zMJEI">nurses</a> at a hospital in Brooklyn also authorized potential strikes this month, with more than 99 percent of all votes supportive of the action.</p>
<h3 id="a-win-for-dollar-general-workers">A Win For Dollar General Workers</h3>
<p>Last week, Dollar General shareholders <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2023/06/05/dollar-general-shareholders-approve-audit-of-worker-safety-conditions-crime-robbery/70278594007/">agreed</a> to a <a href="https://investor.dollargeneral.com/download/companies/dollargeneral/Presentations/Dollar%20General_2023%20Proxy%20Statement.pdf#page=72">resolution</a> calling for an independent audit of worker safety, after hundreds of workers from multiple states showed up at the company’s headquarters in Tennessee to protest dangerous working conditions. The audit will hopefully lead to system-wide changes at the company’s 19,000-plus stores in 47 states, helping more than 170,000 employees stay safe at work, and could have far-reaching implications for workers’ rights across the economy</p>
<p>Dollar General is one of the nation’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/06/business/dollar-store-openings-retail/index.html">fastest</a>-growing chains. <em>The Lever </em>has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-pundits-inflation-myth-crushed-the-working-class/">reported</a> on how corporate profiteers have hiked up prices nationally, and as consumers are increasingly strained by the price gouging, reports suggest they’re <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/business/dollar-stores-inflation/index.html">turning</a> to dollar stores for more affordable options. But apparently, Dollar General’s windfall hasn’t led to improved conditions or pay for its workers.</p>
<p>“Dollar General has shown a pattern of alarmingly willful disregard for federal safety standards, choosing to place profits over their employees’ safety and well-being,” Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker said in 2022.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Dollar General has <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region4/11012022#:~:text=The%20violations%20found%20in%20these,to">accrued</a> more than $12.3 million in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) penalties for hazardous work conditions, like understaffing, blocked safety exits, frequent armed robbery, inaccessible fire extinguishers, electrocution risks, and unsafe storage areas, the latter of which creates high risk of workers being hit by falling boxes or trapped indoors during an emergency. Across the company, 92 percent of Dollar General workers make under $15 an hour, leaving them vulnerable to financial strain from injuries and hazards.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors <a href="https://investor.dollargeneral.com/download/companies/dollargeneral/Presentations/Dollar%20General_2023%20Proxy%20Statement.pdf#page=72">unanimously</a> recommended against the shareholders approving the audit, but it passed anyway, and hopefully will usher in a new era of worker safety.</p>
<h3 id="judges-rule-for-trans-rights">Judges Rule For Trans Rights</h3>
<p>In the South, judges are taking steps to protect trans rights in the face of GOP attacks. A Florida judge <a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-desantis-florida-033556c6a4c301d9ad342c74a6410800?user_email=6059d66d8a7ff49200c841aed37ccb3d738d96854432b8c16a0b1d21449e0388&utm_medium=APNews_Alerts&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_campaign=NewsAlerts_06062023_FloridaTransCareRuling&utm_term=AP%20News%20Alerts">blocked</a> portions of a law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis that would have stopped transgender youths from receiving puberty blockers. Meanwhile, a Trump-appointed judge in Tennessee struck <a href="https://apnews.com/article/drag-law-unconstitutional-tennessee-lgbtq-ff16eb4bdbd0d69863eef38bf93503cf">down</a> what would have been a first-in-the-nation law banning drag performance as “obscene” adult cabaret.</p>
<p>In Florida, Judge Robert Hinkle affirmed that “gender identity is real,” as he ruled in favor of three children whose parents sued when their care was to be halted by the law. In Tennessee, U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker found the state’s law “unconstitutionally vague” and “discriminatory.”</p>
<p>Although most Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/">support</a> protecting transgender people from discrimination, a growing wave of anti-trans legislation is sweeping the nation, pushed along by right-wing and Christian lobbying groups who are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/31/anti-trans-bills-2023-america">funneling</a> millions into cracking down on healthcare freedoms.</p>
<p>These two rulings — in states that are otherwise <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/02/tennessee-governor-bill-lee-signs-anti-trans-bill-drag-restrictions-into-law/69937336007/">extremely</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-transgender-health-care-adults-e7ae55eec634923e6593a4c0685969b2">hostile</a> to transgender healthcare — are small victories in a much larger battle for LGBTQ+ rights. Meanwhile, DeSantis and his team continue to express their opposition to the ruling.</p>
<p>“We will continue fighting against the rogue elements in the medical establishment that push ideology over evidence,” said DeSantis press secretary Jeremy Redfern — which is confusing, since the DeSantis-backed law that Hinckle struck down is a perfect example of rogue elements pushing ideology over evidence.</p>

<h3 id="this-week%E2%80%99s-boat-rocker">This Week’s Boat-rocker:</h3>
<p><strong>Josie Pinto</strong> is a reproductive rights activist and the co-founder of the nonprofit Reproductive Freedom Fund of New Hampshire (RFFNH). Josie started RFFNH after working at a health center in New Hampshire, where she found that many patients could not afford the abortions they needed.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZlpjfbO38wREPFvBIOI1PpN6r91RXZRIUqlEhiA9II8kdKZ0OZqcSQTpuLsIeBBSAQDqwOxIoUNVZdC1EzYgJW0P1q8Zv8CqPxryKTQJtG-fKQspD7adBtFI15bIKqVOI8Yjr1kdAqSvvo_wbPbh1p0" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="453" height="624">
    <figcaption>Josie Pinto</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since RFFNH launched in 2021 it has helped 500 New Hampshire patients afford abortions — and since <em>Roe v. Wade </em>was overturned, it has helped more than 100 patients from 30 other states. The fund pays for hotel rooms, flights, and medical procedures, and provides abortion doulas for emotional support. They also recently started a queer care fund, and have helped more than 50 transgender patients with gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>Abortion funds collaborate across state-lines as needed; Josie said that in some cases, a patient can get money from up to 10 different funds. RFFNH supports patients in states without abortion access and also in states like New York, where funds are overwhelmed by cascades of out-of-state patients. Roughly 70 percent of RFFNH’s patients are on Medicaid, and this summer, Josie is focused on introducing a bill in the New Hampshire state legislature that would expand Medicaid coverage to fund abortions.</p>
<p>“I feel like every day I get to wake up and truly know I’m doing as much as I can on this issue,” said Josie. “It gives me a lot of peace.”</p>
