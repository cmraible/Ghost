<p>You’ll crave the rumble of the 440ci V8 Super Commando engine. It was overhauled with forged pistons and a steel crankshaft, plus it uses a 4 barrel Holley carb for plenty of hard-hitting power. The Slap Stick automatic transmission with three speeds and overdrive makes cruising easy.</p>

<p>Thanks to a complete and professional frame-off restoration 5 years ago by Street Dreams in Billings, Missouri, this car looks absolutely perfect both outside and in. The highly desirable Plum Crazy metallic purple paint is in excellent condition, so you can wax and shine this car for super impressive looks. Matte black mirror caps and spoiler add some nice contrast.</p>
<p>Climb inside and you’ll find a sophisticated black vinyl interior with black carpet, which compliments the exterior well. Custom stitched Mopar floormats are a nice touch while an FM radio allows you to listen to some of your favorite stations while cruising.</p>
<p>Known as the “gentleman’s hot rod,” the GTX debuted in 1967 as a performance trim for the Belvedere. They helped establish that Plymouth could combine luxury and rubber-burning capabilities in an attractive car. 1971 was the final production year for the Plymouth GTX, capping off a run of just over 12,000 units. The final model year was smaller than before and featured a curvier updated body, plus the rear track was wider as a way to boost handling.</p>
<p>A mere 2,942 1971 models rolled off the production line, meaning this particular car is quite rare, and thanks to <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a> you have the opportunity to be the lucky new owner.</p>
