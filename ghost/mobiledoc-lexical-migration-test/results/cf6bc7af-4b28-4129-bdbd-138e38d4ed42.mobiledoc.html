<p>As one of the most capable <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851942-2020-Ford-Mustang-Shelby-GT500-CFTP">Ford Mustangs</a> ever created, the 2020 Ford Mustang <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851942-2020-Ford-Mustang-Shelby-GT500-CFTP">Shelby GT500</a> is absolutely incredible. It is capable of a 0-60 sprint in just 3.3-seconds and a quarter-mile ET of 10.7-seconds while on its way to a 180-mph top-speed. When compared to its Chevy competitor, that equates to a .2-second advantage getting up to cruising speed and almost a full second advantage in the quarter-mile. Dodge’s Redeye puts up a tougher fight but still loses to this ultimate Mustang. For this vehicle class, performance specs like these are almost unheard <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851942-2020-Ford-Mustang-Shelby-GT500-CFTP">of and the GT500</a> is fully capable of keeping up with cars that cost nearly double the original MSRP.</p>
