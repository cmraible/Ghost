<p>A clean presentation outside and in makes this Viper SRT-10 compelling in a number of ways. The seller says there are only 9,500 miles on the odometer, which you can see displayed in the photos, helping to explain in part why the car looks so good.</p>
<p>Setting a nice sinister tone is the triple black color scheme. That means silky smooth black paint on straight body panels, plus a black soft top in great shape. Silver wheels from the factory, red OE brake calipers, and all the original badging are all present. You get to enjoy the vented hood and awesome side-exist exhaust, too. Soft leather seats with big bolsters, silver pedals and trim pieces, plus white-faced gauges keep the interior interesting.</p>
<p>Pop the hood with pride, because the 8.3-liter V-10 engine will impress even the toughest of critics. The engine compartment is so clean, it would pass white glove inspection. You get to experience the combination of 500-horsepower and 525 lb.-ft. of torque plus a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission for exhilarating acceleration.</p>
<p>Dodge shocked the world when it revealed the Viper in 1991. It was a savage sports car with brashly muscular body panels. Thanks to designer Osamu Shikado, the Dodge Viper received a slimmer and more modern restyling for 2003. It also got a big performance boost to stay ahead of the competition. While the Viper was officially discontinued after 2017, the car has a legendary aura that lends heavily to its collectible nature today.</p>
