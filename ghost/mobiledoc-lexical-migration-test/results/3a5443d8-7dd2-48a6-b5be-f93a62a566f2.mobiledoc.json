This incredible \"Boogie Van\" can be seen coming from a mile away, especially with its name in big, bold airbrushed lettering on the sides. Other exterior highlights include gold pinstripes, chrome grille, chrome bumpers, and amber auxiliary lights. A set of 15-inch Cragar wheels sit on all four corners, and the chrome side pipes add to its old-school aesthetic even more."
