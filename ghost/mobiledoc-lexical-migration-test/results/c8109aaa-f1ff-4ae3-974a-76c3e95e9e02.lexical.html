<hr>
<p>A lot of people fantasize about living like a rockstar and you can hardly blame them. While you might never know what it’s like to walk out on stage to thousands of screaming fans, one lucky bidder will drive away with Poison frontman Bret Michaels’ 2004 Bentley Continental GT. You might not be able to party like rockstar, but you could drive like one.</p>

<p>Front the photos and the description provided on the Barrett-Jackson lot listing, this 2004 Bentley Continental GT looks incredibly clean. In other words, it’s obvious Michaels really cherished this ride. Ho many miles are on the odometer isn’t disclosed, so we have no idea if the man drove it a ton or kept it garaged most of the time, but the ride is almost two decades old, so he held onto it for a reason.</p>

<p>You might be thinking this Bentley looks familiar. It’s enjoyed some screen presence in TV shows <em>Rock of Love</em> and <em>Bret Michaels – Life as I Know It</em>, plus it’s been featured in many print articles and publicity photos over the years, so you could say it’s famous. The Moonbeam Silver paint has a classy appeal, perfectly accentuating the sensible British styling. The Beluga interior is of course loaded with all kinds of solid luxuries.</p>
<p>Packing some serious heat is the 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 engine, so this isn’t just another pretty ride. In other words, you can really get this thing moving when you want some thrilling fun. Or you can take it easy and enjoy quite the comfortable ride.</p>
