<p>Friends:</p>
<p>For the last many months, we’ve been working hard on plans to expand our operations — and now those plans are being realized.</p>
<p>The first phase involves some major technical upgrades to <em>The Daily Poster.</em> To get those done, we will likely be taking a few days off from posting anything new.</p>
<p>Don’t worry: We’ll be back soon, as independent and rabble rousing as ever, and with a few new tricks to show off. It’s the first step in our very ambitious plans, all of which could not be possible without your ongoing support.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: We will still be hosting our live chat with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/p/save-the-date-live-chat-with-nina-8f5">progressive movement leader Nina Turner</a> this Thursday 5/6 at 7pm ET, an event designed exclusively for supporting subscribers.</strong></p>
<p>To participate in the live chat, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/subscribe">click here</a> to become an $8-a-month or $70-a-year subscriber to the Daily Poster.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to share all our plans with you. So stay tuned — big things are happening.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
