The investigation determined 13 vehicles were stolen July 11 and August 23 last year. Among the cars boosted from the Honda dealership were multiple Hellcats."

An arrest warrant was issued for him on March 7, including 16 counts of theft ranging from Class 1 and Class 2 felonies, as ell as one count of burglary, a Class 2 felony. Finding Smith was easy since he was already in DuPage County Jail for a separate incident."
