<p>Unite the Country, a super PAC that supports President Joe Biden, <a href="https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/api/manager/download/b352204e-8ca4-7725-8199-b386311b31f4/ca476e17-7fb8-411d-b366-dd20ae2415fb.pdf">has been</a><a href="https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/api/manager/download/b352204e-8ca4-7725-8199-b386311b31f4/e5de2d89-8b2c-445f-93eb-6eacbc4a849a.pdf">running</a> TV ads in Arizona praising Biden for delivering a big tax break to working-class Americans.</p>
<p>“Joe Biden knows the pain families feel when tomorrow seems so uncertain,” says the ad. “It’s why he signed a historic middle-class tax cut.”</p>

<p>There’s only one problem: That so-called “historic middle-class tax cut” expired last December, after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) refused to support Biden’s Build Back Better legislation.</p>
<p>The expanded child tax credit <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/congress-found-an-easy-way-to-fix-child-poverty-then-it-walked-away/">provided</a> most American parents — <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/child-tax-credit-overview.aspx#:~:text=Beginning%20July%2015%2C%202021%2C%2088,31%2C%202021.">nearly 90 percent</a> — with payments of $250 or $300 per month per kid. The White House has specifically <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/millions-kids-thrust-back-poverty-child-tax-credit-expired-s-rcna13450">characterized</a> the child tax credit as “a historic tax cut for middle-class families.” The program’s expiration left millions more Americans in poverty. Child poverty <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/02/17/child-tax-credit-poverty/">quickly spiked</a>.</p>
<p>The Unite the Country ad offers a depressing preview of what Democrats’ message will look like in the midterm elections this year. Because Democratic lawmakers failed to pass the health care, climate, and anti-poverty spending legislation they debated for much of last year, they don’t have many legislative accomplishments to sell to voters.</p>
<p>As a result, Unite the Country is now stuck touting an expired program, hoping voters will reward Democrats for a tax credit that is no longer helping their families. An advisor to the super PAC did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The lack of policy deliverables is evident in other Democratic groups’ messaging, too. AB PAC, a super PAC founded by Democratic operative David Brock, is currently running TV ads in Arizona saying that “Joe Biden got handed a bag of garbage” and is “doing the best he can with the tools that he has.”</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/Political-Effects-of-the-Expanded-CTC.pdf">recent analysis</a> by the polling outfit Data for Progress, Democrats are <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanBWinter/status/1506661028083474438?">unlikely</a> to see any political benefit from the temporary expansion of the child tax credit. While the organization initially found a slight approval bump for Biden among child tax credit recipients, “now-former CTC recipients approve of Biden at the same (or perhaps even lower) rate as similarly situated non-recipients,” the research group wrote last week.</p>
<p>Adding to the Democrats’ likely midterm woes is the expiration of another federal relief program they have touted as a selling point: the health insurance subsidies included in the party's American Rescue Plan, which the Biden administration previously <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017b-cda3-d916-ad7b-efe75ef00000">described</a> as “a historic tax cut to reduce Americans’ health care costs.”</p>
<p>Those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year, meaning that millions of Americans on individual health insurance plans <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/democrats-creating-their-own-october-surprise/">will receive notices</a> about increased premiums in October — right before the November elections.</p>
