The seller had decoded the data plate, listed the block date and casting code, as well as the block suffix and assembly date, with VIN derivative. He had decoded the Muncie; both the casting code and P-code, with VIN derivative, and completely decoded the rear end with casting date and codes, both the ratio code and assembly date stampings."

Shining my flashlight into the access holes on the underside of the lid showed light remnants of blue that the orange paint had failed to completely conceal. A further assessment under the hood revealed two tiny chips in the black paint in the upper cowl that showed more blue under the black paint. Looking inside the car, I saw a nearly completely restored and beautiful interior, but quickly noticed that both sun visors and both lower front kick panels had formerly been blue originally and had been re-dyed black to match the rest of the interior. Pulling up on the trim panel over the rear package tray from inside the car showed more blue paint, calling into serious question the legitimacy of the data tag on the car."

          "Sliding further forward, the transmission tunnel was a mess. The cutout for the Hurst shifter was little more than a large jagged hole, far too large and incorrectly shaped, with saw marks in the sheet metal at each of the corners of the hole. All 4-speed F-bodies of this era had a separate boxed hump welded over the top of the cutout in the tunnel, but the hump on this car was added later, and was not welded, but secured to the tunnel with sheet metal screws instead, all indications that this car started life as an automatic. Yet strangely enough, of course, right on the side of the Muncie was a correct partial “matching” VIN."

          "Under the hood, the stamp pad on the block looked okay, and the partial VIN stamp matched the VIN on the gearbox. The block casting date and code were both reasonable for the build date on the data tag and the production number in the VIN, but since the data plate denoted this car was born Hugger Orange when it clearly was not, I had no faith in the legitimacy of the data tag. The motor certainly sounded like the vaunted and legendary solid lifter LT-1 that makes the Z/28 so great, but that was the only thing that was good about this fake “Z”. Stepping back out from under the hood, I let out an audible sigh, the inspection had officially gone sideways. There were some other clues this car was not correct, and the seller was about to hear some bad news, and so was my client- this car was not the Z/28 RS it was claimed to be.  "

I always like to do a little back-office legwork on vehicles I inspect before the inspection, but I couldn’t find any history on this example- until I realized the VIN on the seller’s ad was missing one digit of the actual VIN. A correct VIN got me everything else I needed- 2 auction sales in the past few years at different auction houses, with both auction houses declining to represent it as a real RS, or as numbers matching. Both auction sales brought less than half the current asking price (which was almost $60,000) for this wolf in sheep’s clothing. Even worse, pictures of the engine area in both sales clearly showed no data tag on the cowl at all, confirming my suspicions that the tag had been replaced."

I saved my client $60k that day (not including the cost to ship and import the car halfway around the world), and while he’s still looking for a good Z/28 to add to his stable, he’s well ahead by not turning $60k into $30k buying the wrong car."
