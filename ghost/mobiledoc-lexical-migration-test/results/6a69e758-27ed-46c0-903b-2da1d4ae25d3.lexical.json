In the wake of Amazon workers on Staten Island voting to form the first-ever U.S. union at the company, entrenched labor unions are rethinking their approach to organizing. Also, the top lawyer at the federal agency enforcing labor laws issued a memo that could make it easier for workers, including at Amazon, to overcome union busting.

Finally, an archival discovery reveals an iconic musician speaking out in support of striking teachers.",
