<hr>
<p>So far in 2022 there have been over 2,000 cars stolen in Seattle, Washington. This is a growing problem in many cities like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mopar-car-thefts-detroit/">Detroit</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/oakland-littered-abandoned-cars/">Oakland</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/denver-metro-car-theft/">Denver</a>, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chicago-man-charged/">Chicago</a>. Instead of waiting for the government to do something about the problem, one resident has instead decided to put his drone flying skills to use by taking to the skies in search of vehicles people have reported missing.</p>

<p>The guy, who was identified by a local news crew only as tony, lives in West Seattle. After having his own car broken into and a trailer stolen, he went on a search to try getting his property back. That’s when he started learning just how pervasive car theft is in Seattle, thanks in part to a Facebook group where people post their missing vehicles.</p>

<p>Members of that group let Tony know about a secret encampment hidden from view underneath a bridge in Seattle. Using his drone, he immediately saw dozens of cars, garbage, tents, and more just scattered on the empty land. Apparently, it’s a well-known chop shop that for some reason hasn’t been shut down. Tony witnessed guys with Sawzalls actively chopping up cars.</p>

<p>"People who steal from other people I feel are some of the worst scum on the planet. I hate them," Tony said. "If I can do anything to stop them, or help people who have been victims, I'd like to be a part of that."</p>
<p>Tony kept going back to the location, using his eye in the sky to help track down other people’s missing vehicles. He was able to help with two recoveries, although one car was chopped up by the time police arrived. Another was used to try outrunning the drone, but eventually the thieves gave up and abandoned it.</p>

<p>Another time recently, people at the Seattle chop shop heard his drone overhead. One produced an airsoft pistol, shooting the drone less than an inch from the lens. That won’t stop Tony, who says he wants to work with police to recover more stolen cars.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, just feels like the police have their hands tied behind their backs and you just can't do anything," Tony said.</p>
<p>Sadly, in cities like Seattle lax policing and legal prosecution has led to surging crime like car theft, leaving residents in the lurch.</p>
