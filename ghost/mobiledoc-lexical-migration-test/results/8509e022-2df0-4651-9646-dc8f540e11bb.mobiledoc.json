          "A rust-free donor car was sourced before being fashioned with custom tubular front frame rails. Next a potent 427 cubic-inch LS7 engine was installed, but mounted lower and further back in the chassis for better weight distribution. This El Caminoâ€™s new heart produces 650-horsepower, with that power being channeled to the rear wheels via a Tremec 6 speed manual transmission. Custom suspension was fitted, along with Baer 6-piston brakes to keep this high-performance machine in check."

While the minimalist two-seat interior might appear to be all about function, this car was design to be used everyday. Its owner, Spectre Racing, frequently drove it on the street to events, taking full advantage of installed comforts such as air conditioning and power steering. The Chevy is a fantastic blend of extreme performance and modern reliability."
