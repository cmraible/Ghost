With a beefy 392 V8 under the hood versus your average pursuit-rated cop car, this wasn’t even a contest. The situation does demonstrate why some departments have opted for hotter muscle cars like Hellcats because they’re dealing with quite a few criminals driving vehicles which are far faster than the average cop car. And despite what everyone says, sometimes the radio isn’t enough to catch these guys."

Unless he had a temporary tag on the car or had removed his plate (which would explain why the officer wanted to pull him over) he didn’t actually get away for long. Or maybe the Scat Pack was stolen, but then how did he have access to the front and rear dash cam footage? Sadly, we don’t get any answers to these questions."

And let’s face it: nobody drives absolutely perfectly. We all do thins on the road which could pick us up a citation. Thankfully, most officers are understanding of this, but you get some who just don’t like performance vehicles or the people they think always are behind the wheel and you become a target."

We can neither confirm or deny any of this since the terrain in Mexico is varied, although the infrastructure and cars all look a little too much like somewhere in the States. But since when has anyone lied about such a thing to duck YouTube’s policies?"
