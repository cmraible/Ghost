<hr>
<p>Some couples think if they break the law together it’s some sort of romantic thing, like they’re Bonnie and Clyde. If you’ve ever seen pictures of the famous criminal couple, you’d know they looked nothing like the romanticized Hollywood depictions. They also didn’t die glamorously. It’s the same story with this couple who ran from Arkansas State Police in a Dodge Charger at speeds well over 100 mph on a little two-lane highway.</p>

<p>First off, running from Arkansas State Police isn’t advisable. While no law enforcement agency has a 100% catch rate, these guys are good. We’ve seen them run down far superior vehicles through their excellent driving skills. Plus, most people who run from the cops aren’t nearly as good at driving as they think.</p>

<p>We noticed the suspects’ Charger has a temporary tag on it. Perhaps they didn’t want to wreck their newly purchased car, because after a while they just pulled over and surrendered. Obviously, the Mopar was impounded, but it probably wasn’t seized, unless they were transporting drugs in it or something along those lines.</p>
<p>This situation is a good example of backtracking after you’ve made a really dumb decision. Sure, it’s going to hurt, but doubling down on your stupid choice will only make things worse in the long run, like if they’d hit a tree at 130 mph.</p>
<p>By the way, at the beginning of the video the trooper is travelling in the right lane and slows down after seeing the speeding Charger going the other direction. A guy in a Mustang passes him on the left, then the trooper suddenly pulls behind him. We can only imagine what was going on in the Mustang driver’s head for that split second until the trooper flipped a U and went the opposite way.</p>
