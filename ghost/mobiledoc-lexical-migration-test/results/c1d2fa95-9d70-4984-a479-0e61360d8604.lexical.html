<h2 id="nobody-is-owed-your-attention">Nobody is owed your attention</h2>
<p>A couple of months ago I vaguely disagreed on Facebook with an acquaintance who is fairly big name author these days. He was opining on an area that wasn't his area of expertise — nor mine — but was my wife's. And I passed on her correction. Much to my surprise, despite having happy memories of co-authoring something with him nearly 20 years ago, he unleashed both barrels and me, and a couple of his fans piled in, too.</p>
<p>It was the work of a moment to block him and them. He's clearly not my friend, and he is <em>not</em> owed my attention.</p>
<p>While tracking something else entirely, I discovered that the 'gentleman' in question has a reputation for being completely unable to handle <em>any</em> criticism at all. And yet he spends significant amounts of time assiduously farming attention on social media. I cannot begin to imagine the mental damage that those two behaviours in conjunction must be doing to his psyche.</p>
<p>For years, I've pointed out that journalists need to have a thick skin if they participate on social media. If you work in a profession which is rooted in challenging others, you must be open to some challenge yourself. Indeed, back in the mid-2000s, I spent significant amounts of time persuading colleagues that it was worth engaging with criticisms of their work, because often those criticisms were valid, and we could learn from them. </p>
<p>However, there is clearly a line where valid criticism crosses the line into abuse: </p>

<p>We're living through an age where politicians are raising the temperature of the rhetoric against journalists, and their followers are obediently aping that tone of voice. And there's a fine line to be walked between protecting ourselves and ceding the spaces of public discourse to the polarized factions.</p>
<p>Part of the solution is being more free with the block button. As I said, nobody is owed your attention, and people unable to act in a civilised way do not deserve even an iota of your time. But that approach is, at the very most, a plaster on an open wound of festering toxic discourse. </p>
<p>We clearly need to find a new way forwards - and this looks like a good start. </p>

<p>It's been a depressing week for layoffs in the journalism industry.

<p>Long term readers will know how interesting I find Taylor Lorenz's journalism. She's doing great work on the intersection of tech and culture, rather than tech and business - or even just pure tech. </p>
