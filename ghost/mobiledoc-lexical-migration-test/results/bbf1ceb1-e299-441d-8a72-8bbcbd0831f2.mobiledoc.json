However, the firm was quick to point out prices for new cars have remained high. That leads many to wonder if the new vehicle shortage will turn into a surplus, putting the industry in yet another tight spot."

Compare that to the 1.32 million available at the close of September and you can start to see how quickly supply is building. Even more interesting, when compared to the end of October 2021 that figure is 78% higher, or in other words there were 680,000 more units on lots at the close of last month."

The top five were Lexus, Land Rover, Acura, and BMW, respectively. Out of non-luxury brands, Toyota, Kia, Honda, and Subaru showed the lowest supply on dealer lots. However, domestic full-size trucks are apparently in high supply right now."

With those factors at play, prices might have to come down, with the consequences being dire for some in the industry. Cox noted the average listing price for October was $46,317, up slightly from September’s $46,212. In other words, price deflation hasn’t begun."
