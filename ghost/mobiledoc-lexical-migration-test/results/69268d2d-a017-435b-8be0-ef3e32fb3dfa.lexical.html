<p><strong>Update:</strong> Both vehicles have been discovered after tips led police to a barn and shed in the area. Several suspects in the theft of these vehicles have been identified and an investigation is underway. The only reported damage was done to the ignition in the Mustang, so this story ends on a happy note.</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong> A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-cold-case-murder/">grieving family</a> in Bonney Lake, Washington has had insult added to injury after thieves swiped a 1933 Ford Model A truck and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-ford-mustang-stolen/">1966 Ford Mustang</a> which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-dead-mans-classic-cars/">belonged to their now-deceased father</a> and grandfather. A neighbor’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-remind-lock-doors/">surveillance camera</a> caught on video the thieves using the Mustang to pull the truck, both of which are blue.</p>

<p>Both vehicles were being kept at Barbara Lauderdale’s home. They were her father’s cars and they have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/challenger-with-ashes/">significant sentimental value</a>. "It means a lot because it's part of my dad. My dad passed away, so that's really a lot of remembrance of me and him growing up watching him working on the cars. We would drive them around the parades. It's a big part of our lives that you've taken and that's my brother, that's us, that's our dad. That's my mom's life and you've gone in there and taken what we have," Lauderdale told a local reporter.</p>

<p>While the truck doesn’t appear to be licensed, the Mustang has plate CV29527. We doubt the thieves kept that on the car, but you never know. Police are saying anyone who has information about either of these stolen classic Fords can contact the Auto Theft Task Force – Puget Sound on Facebook, Crime Stoppers, or the Bonney Lake PD Tip line.</p>
<p>There seems to be a trend of thieves stealing classic cars which belong to owners who have recently passed away. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but we don’t pass along all the stories we come across, of which there are shockingly many right now. Of course, classic cars are exceptionally easy to steal, so that could be a possible factor, which is why we recommend storing them in a secured garage. Shockingly, car thieves don’t seem to care what kind of sentimental value you have attached to a vehicle.</p>
