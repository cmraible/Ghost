Also updated, the interior features new carpeting, seatbelts, seals, and heat shielding for greater comfort. Different OE components have been cleaned, repaired, and repainted for an authentic look and feel. As an automatic, this is the kind of classic wagon you can use to cruise in complete comfort."

A Ford 9-inch with 3.75:1 gears helps lay that power down to the road. Other improvements have been added, like a high-capacity radiator, automatic transmission, power steering, and 4-wheel power disc brakes. Considering the many modern updates and the undeniable attraction of Woodies, this wagon is one to watch."
