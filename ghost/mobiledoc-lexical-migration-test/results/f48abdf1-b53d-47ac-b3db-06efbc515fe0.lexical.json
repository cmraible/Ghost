Of course, the best part is that it was made in 1936  which is insane to think about when you see how good of condition the vehicle is in. Under the hood, you'll find an engine that you might not expect in such an aged automobile. Utilizing 4.0-liters of displacement, this incredible straight-eight engine is a stark contrast to  the high displacement inline-sixes that were shaping the American sector. All of this is well and good but you might be wondering how much power the car actually makes.",
