Originally made to combine a small and lightweight chassis with a  massive engine and great looks, the Corvette had  a  pretty big reputation to live up to. Needless to say, it pretty much exceeded nearly every expectation fans  of the brand had for it making it a legend in American automotive culture. Nowadays, there are many shows and events dedicated solely to the sports car with the biggest of them all being Corvettes At Carlisle. This show has been  known for  some  pretty crazy stuff in the past but this year's event was extra special because of one vehicle that amazed practically everyone there.",

However, as the driver Mike from Street Speed 717, this Corvette is pretty much all ‘Vette on the inside as well as the body.",

In fact, this car  sits atop the chassis of a Chevy Blazer which is the perfect frame for anyone with a taste for having fun on the road. Under the hood is clearly a V8 engine from the sound of things and the car apparently runs and drives pretty well, though turning seems to be a bit of a tricky endeavor. All of this  combined to make one incredible piece at the Corvettes At Carlisle event and we hope to see it again next year showing its colors once more.",
