<p>If you’re on the hunt for a truly special, premium classic car from the European brands, <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">RM Sotheby’s</a> is offering six different options which should be on your short list. These are not auction vehicles, but instead are part of <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/search/#?items=PS00_r4891&items=PS00_r4892&items=PS00_r4893&items=PS00_r4896&items=PS00_r4897&items=PS00_r4895?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The Driver’s Collection</a>. You could very possibly win shows and impress some of the staunchest critics with these cars.</p>

<p>The most attention-grabbing of the bunch is a Speed Yellow <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/private-sales/r4893-1995-porsche-911-carrera-rs-38/976428?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1995 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 3.8</a>. For many this represents the pinnacle of the air-cooled 911s before they were replaced by the 996, and so this is a car which should remain collectible for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>However, the most desirable option is an ultra-rare <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/private-sales/r4891-1960-mercedes-benz-300-sl-roadster/976354?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1960 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster</a>. Only 1,858 of these were made and this one has retained the original metric gauges, wheels, hardtop in factory crate, and tool kit. Anyone can plainly see this is an absolutely beautiful classic you can show off with pride.</p>

<p>A pair of Alfa Romeos are included in <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/search/#?items=PS00_r4891&items=PS00_r4892&items=PS00_r4893&items=PS00_r4896&items=PS00_r4897&items=PS00_r4895?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">The Driver’s Collection</a>. A <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/private-sales/r4892-1960-alfa-romeo-giulietta-sz-zagato/976391?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1960 Alfa Romeo Giulietta SZ Zagato</a> should raise more than a few eyebrows since a mere 200 of these were ever produced. What’s more, this is an early production “Coda Tonda” or “round tail” car, making it highly desirable among collectors.</p>

<p>Representing the UK is a <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/home/private-sales/r4896-1965-jaguar-e-type-series-1-42-litre-fixed-head-coupe/976585?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1965 Jaguar E-Type Series 1 4.2-liter Fixed Head Coupe</a> with a proper Willow Green over tobacco leather scheme. The classic car went through a complete restoration after it was purchased by the current owner in 2014 and as you can clearly see it is in exquisite condition today. A Tremec five-speed manual transmission, Wilwood brakes, and wider wheels have been installed to make this Jaguar more enjoyable to drive.</p>
