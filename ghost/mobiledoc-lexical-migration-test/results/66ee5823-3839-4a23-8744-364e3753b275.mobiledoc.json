Then there are those who drive Chargers because they want to be mistaken for police officers. That helps explain why the Wake County Sheriff’s Office in North Carolina caught a man in a Charger with active blue lights."

Deputies pulled over Devin Alexander Stenulis, 34, and quickly realized he had been charged for impersonating law enforcement in the past."

          "We’ve seen other incidents of guys in Dodge Chargers as well as other cars accused of impersonating law enforcement, which is always concerning. Unfortunately, it’s not a new thing, with even Ted Bundy having posed as a cop so he could kidnap and murder women. That’s part of the danger with people who think they get to play police officer and enforce the law as some sort of vigilante. While Bundy didn’t drive a car model commonly used by law enforcement, many of these guys do, but sometimes we see ones who don’t and act like they’re deep undercover. Sadly, some people fall for the ruse. If you’re pulled over by someone you don’t think is a real cop, call 911. Dispatchers will gladly confirm if the person is actually law enforcement or not."
