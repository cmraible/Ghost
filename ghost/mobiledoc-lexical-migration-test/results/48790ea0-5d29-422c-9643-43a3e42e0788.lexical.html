<hr>
<p>You've all heard of the infamous LS-swapped RX-7 platform but have you ever seen a rotary engine stuffed into the engine bay of an American legend that utilized one of those GM motors from the factory? That's right, recently the internet was exposed to a pretty sick <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-production-yet-again/">looking Corvette</a> C5 Z06 which has a little bit more than what you might have expected from a Mazda when rotaries were still being made in cars. Along with that, a few extra mods have been done to the car which make it a pretty unique automobile and pretty much unlike anything seen before.</p>
<p><strong>See the Corvette that leaves us with more questions <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/split-window-c8-corvette-comes-with-so-many-questions/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Under the hood of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/koenigsegg-praises-c8-corvette/">Corvette</a> is a two-rotor rotary which is pretty great in terms of performance within the rotary community. It uses a two-rotor system for a lot of complicated engineering reasons but it was once essentially a stock RX-7 engine. This platform is known for its lack of torque but it doesn’t really seem to be an issue in this C5 Corvette. Rather, barreling down straights and tight turns you’ll notice this vehicle making a whopping 550 ft/lbs of torque.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Corvette engine weighed in at just around 200 lbs heavier than the rotary the vehicles got now. Because of this, the leaf springs that originally came in the Corvette had to be yanked out and replaced with a set of coil overs. Adding to this beautiful insanity, a lot of work was done to make the T56 Magnum transmission fit in place of the stock example. Overall, it’s an incredible build that makes history with many car enthusiasts and even pays some tribute to the first rotary ‘Vette made in the 1960s.</p>
