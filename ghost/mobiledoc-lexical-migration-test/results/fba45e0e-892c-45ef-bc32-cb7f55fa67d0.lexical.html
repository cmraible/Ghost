<hr>
<p>A lot of losers want to be cops but can’t, usually because they wouldn’t pass the background check or maybe the physical requirements. Instead of just giving up on their dream, some drive decommissioned cop cars or a current model outfitted to look like a police cruiser, trying to be a big man while pulling people over and giving them warnings. Then there’s this guy in Park County, Colorado who decided to do one better and just steal a cop car, then respond to a 911 call. You just can’t make this stuff up.</p>

<p>Showing he has more bravado than brains, 33-year-old Jeremiah Taylor, broke into a Park County Sheriff’s Department substation at about 3 am on June 20. Inside he found keys labeled for a 2013 Dodge Durango, so he went outside and fired the beast up. When he did, the radio switched on and the guy heard a call for Teller County deputies to respond to a report of domestic violence.</p>
<p>The man is old enough to know better. But the guy obviously is dumb as a rock because of all the police calls he decided to respond to, he went to a domestic violence call. Those are one of the most dangerous responses a police officer does. Many cops get blown away just standing on the doorstep and knocking. Now that wouldn’t been quite the plot twist.</p>
<p>Instead, Teller County deputies showed up and found the strange guy at the resident, who had told the people there he was a Park County deputy. The responding deputies later said they suspected Taylor was drunk. They might have meant on alcohol, but he definitely was drunk on power. After all, the guy arrived on scene with the siren blaring and asked “where’s the old man that’s going to shoot somoeone?”</p>
<p>Teller County deputies ordered Taylor to stop, but he sped off from the scene. At about 5:30 am they spotted him again and chased him at speeds over 100 mph. Taylor crashed the tired Durango, doing the sheriff’s department a favor, then took off on foot.</p>
<p>When deputies caught up to Taylor, he allegedly pulled out a belt knife, which is a really good way to get shot. Deputies fired at least one shot and deployed a taser, but we don’t have details there. Ultimately, they took Taylor into custody, ending what’s one of the weirdest incidents they’ve undoubtedly ever experienced.</p>
<p>Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw seemed pretty perplexed about the situation. He said it was the first time in his 40 years of service he’d had someone steal a deputy’s vehicle. Police in Portland experience such a thing on the regular, so he should be grateful for his geographical advantage.</p>
<p>Now Taylor is facing charges that include resisting arrest, impersonating a police officer, and aggravated vehicle theft.</p>
