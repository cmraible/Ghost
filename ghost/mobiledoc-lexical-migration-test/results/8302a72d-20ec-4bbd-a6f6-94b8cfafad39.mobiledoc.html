It also wasn’t a dramatic police chase after they swiped a Hellcat. Instead, it was the sheriff’s office investigating a string of thefts from construction sites in the area.</p>

<p>Without tipping off the suspects, authorities kept an eye out for a white cargo van which was connected to the recent theft of an excavator at a construction site. A deputy tracked the van down, which was parked at a house not too far from the other one. Poking around, investigators found more construction equipment which was reported stolen. Of course, the thieves had removed VINs from whatever they could, like that wouldn’t be suspicious.</p>
