<p>This 1980 Jeep Cherokee instantly announces it's something custom the moment it arrives on the scene. Even if you didn't know, they never made an open-top version, the bold paint, lifted stance, custom interior, and the sound of the big V8 all make sure you know this is a genuinely unique 4x4. Many people forgot that the original Cherokee was prominent and in charge... but when they see this one, they'll never forget it again. The power dome hood, imposing wide grille, flared fenders, and well-creased body lines give this one an instant presence. And, of course, the orange radiates with an extraordinary boldness.</p>

<p>This stunning original X33, Code 72, Hugger Orange, RS Z/28 is the recipient of a complete frame-off restoration.

<p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles produced by Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger. From model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda. Introduced in fall 1969 for the 1970 model year, the Challenger was one of two Chrysler E-body cars, the other being the slightly smaller Plymouth Barracuda. Positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car market segment, it was "a rather late response" to the Ford Mustang, which debuted in April 1964.</p>
