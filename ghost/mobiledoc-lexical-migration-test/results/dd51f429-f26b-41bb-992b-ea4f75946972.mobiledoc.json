He has an array of offensive actions that aren’t just the homing attack, and a selection of defensive options that aren’t just…not being there when an enemy attacks. The game also offers a small skill tree which expands on Sonic’s combat abilities in a way that feels satisfying. The game rewards building a combo metre by giving Sonic flashy, high damaging, fast hitting moves that are honestly just fun. The defensive options include a dodge and a parry, which are both very easy to perform. The game does not incentivise last minute dodging, and you can simply hold the parry button and wait for the enemy to attack with no adverse effect. The combat honestly has a low “skill floor” that allows people new to action games an easy time, but a high “skill ceiling” that allows experienced players to pull off impressive combos. "

My personal favourite was “Squid,” a flying enemy which left a trail behind for Sonic to chase it on, and fires projectiles down the path for you to dodge. It’s an example of how Sonic Team did not stray too far away from what makes a Sonic game a Sonic game when trying to make the game less of a guided experience. The first major boss of the game was also a very hype fight, and one that made me realise that "
