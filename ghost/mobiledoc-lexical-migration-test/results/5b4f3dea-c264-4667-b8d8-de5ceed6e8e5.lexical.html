<p>We were pretty intrigued when we saw that recently police in Ontario, Canada busted multiple stunt drivers. At first glance it makes the American mind wonder if there was a movie being filmed (which happens a lot in Canada) and some of the stunt drivers got out of hand, doing tricks on public roads where they weren’t supposed to. But no, this is a case of language barrier, but it’s still an interesting story.</p>

<p>Per the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, “stunt driving” can include actually performing a stunt behind the wheel of a car, or betting on race/contest on a roadway. So, they call street racing “stunt driving” because Canada.</p>

<p>In one incident, York Regional Police posted to its official, verified Twitter account that a red Corvette was clocked going 128 km/h, which is about 79 mph. We don’t know what the posted limited was, but we’ll assume it was well under that speed.</p>

<p>A release from the department says 25 drivers were charged with stunt driving over the weekend of November 5-7. The vehicles were impounded for 14 days and the drivers were arrested. Other charges were added in there, including dangerous driving and speeding.</p>
<p>And here we thought Canadians were extra nice and courteous.</p>

<p>OPP Highway Safety Division also took to Twitter with its official, verified account to show how a 22-year-old driver in a Mazda was clocked going 174 km/h on Highway 8. We don’t know what the speed limit is there, but that’s about 108 mph, which we think is probably a fair bit above what they’re supposed to be going. That person picked up a stunt driving charge along with speeding and novice driver BAC above zero or in other words a blood alcohol level that wasn’t zero. Not good. That last charge comes with a 24-hour suspension of the driver’s license.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that even in Canada they have problems with stunting or street racing. Also, they have funny names for things.</p>
