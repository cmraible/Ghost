          "Video of a damaged Chevy Camaro stopped in the middle of a lane on Interstate 5 in Los Angeles shows the scary reality of driving in modern California. Despite the muscle car having its emergency lights on, multiple drivers narrowly miss it, showing just how inattentive they are behind the wheel. That seems inconceivable considering the state government legislated away driver distraction."

Even though we only see it from behind, you can still spot the front bumper isn’t fully attached and there’s something broken on the front driver’s side axle, judging by the way it’s sitting on the level highway. That’s probably why the driver didn’t pull off to the shoulder, instead leaving it in the lane."

Then a Mustang almost rear-ended it, slamming on its brakes before the driver did almost a 90-degree turn to get around the Chevy. Finally, a couple of fire trucks create a safe haven for the broken-down muscle car, otherwise it was only a matter of time before there would have been a serious accident."

I don’t know if they were really all that good or not back in the day, but as an adult I’ve found they’re just as crappy as most drivers in the West, if not even worse. This video is a perfect illustration of how despite all the fancy laws in the state, people there still don’t pay attention when they’re driving."
