<h3 id="this-supercharged-saleen-was-the-ultimate-mustang-in-its-day-and-this-one-has-less-than-14000-miles">This supercharged Saleen was the ultimate Mustang in its day, and this one has less than 14,000 miles.</h3>
<p>In the days before you could just stroll into your neighborhood <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> dealership and buy a 760-horsepower Shelby GT500 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/Mustang" rel="nofollow">Mustang</a>, you had to rely on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/highlights/" rel="nofollow">tuner </a>companies like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Saleen" rel="nofollow">Saleen</a> to get the most performance from Mustangs. Saleen has been cranking out some high-powered ponies since the '80s, but the company really hit its stride with the fourth-gen Ford Mustang, and this beautiful, low-mileage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/178504/2001-saleen-mustang-s-281sc" rel="nofollow noopener">2001 Saleen Mustang S-281SC</a> is a perfect example.</p>

<p>Saleen only built 466 S-281SC Mustangs built in 2001 (243 coupes and 223 convertibles), and this one – no. 317 – might be one of the cleanest that you'll find. While some of these cars were raced, modified and/or abused, this 2001 Saleen Mustang S-281SC has been well preserved with less than 14,000 original miles on the odometer. Looking at the overall condition of this car, it's amazing it has <em>that</em> many miles... this car is immaculate!</p>
<p>The New Edge body style gave the 1999-2004 Mustangs plenty of attitude, but Saleen added to that with the S-281. All of these models received a design that was distinctive from the standard Mustang without being too extreme. These cars all got sportier front and rear bumpers, a larger rear wing, louvered side scoops, subtle C-pillar trim and upgraded five-spoke wheels with high-performance tires. Inside, Saleen Mustangs have unique leather shift knob, 200-mph speedometer and a gauge pod on top of the dash with boost pressure and intercooler water temp gauges. All cars get serialized plaques on the dash and under the hood as well as a serialized bumper number.</p>

<p>What really made the Saleen Mustangs special, though, is the performance and handling improvements made to the car. For better handling, the S-281 gets a "racecraft" suspension with Saleen-tuned variable-rate springs, struts, rear shocks and front sway bar, but the ultimate version is S-218SC. The "SC" of course stands for the Roots-style, intercooled supercharger, which along with a special engine computer tune bumps the car's output to 350 horsepower – a base Mustang GT had 285 horsepower, while the factory Cobra bumped power output to 320 horsepower.</p>
