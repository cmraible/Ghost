<p>Not only is E3 good for its presentations, but we also get a whole lot of release date announcements and trailers. There have been quite a few announcements in the past 12 hours, so we thought we’d combine them into one article. Enjoy…</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Not all games have new trailers or release date announcements. Also, these dates are still subjected to change and may vary from region, but at the very least this should provide you with a good estimate.</em></p>
