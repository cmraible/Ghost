<p><a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/vehicles/245/1967-chevrolet-corvette-427-390">1967 marked</a> the first year for the L88 engine option for the Corvette but it’s hefty price tag made it an unpopular choice for the model year. In all, only 20 L88 Corvettes were produced that first year making it one of the most coveted Corvettes of all time. However, a more popular option for the last of the <a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/vehicles/245/1967-chevrolet-corvette-427-390">mid-year Corvettes</a> was the 390-horsepower 427-cid engine. </p>

<p>The big block featured a hydraulic lifter design that was better suited for the street than the solid lifter L88 option on top of being more affordable. In addition to the <a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/vehicles/245/1967-chevrolet-corvette-427-390">C2’s impressive</a> power output, it was also almost unanimously hailed for its handling capabilities which made the car a true driver’s car well before it became a collector’s car.</p>
