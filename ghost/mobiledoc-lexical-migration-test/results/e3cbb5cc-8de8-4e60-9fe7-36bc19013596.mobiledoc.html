<p>On Monday, July 12,  the entire <em>Lever </em>staff hosted our weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a> — and they took questions from the audience live on air.</p>

<p>A recent <em>New York Times</em> poll says that only 13 percent of Americans believe the country is on the right track, and that President Biden’s approval rating has sunk to a new low of 33 percent. So if we’re on the wrong track, where are we going? On this special episode of <em>Lever Live</em>, <em>The Lever</em>’s staff answered the audience’s questions about the state of the country, what we’re doing wrong, and where we can go from here.</p>
<p>We asked listeners to call in and give us their on-air take about some big questions:</p>
<p>• What, if anything, can the Democratic party do to salvage the Biden presidency?</p>
<p>• What can voters do to shift the political winds?</p>
<p>• What are some news items keeping us hopeful?</p>
