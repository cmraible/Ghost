<p>The world first got its glimpse of <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1990-land-rover-defender-90-arkonik/">the Defender</a> name in 1990. Very much like the Jeep Wrangler, the design of the Defender 90 and 110 models proved to be highly successful and over the decade not many styling changes were made. <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1990-land-rover-defender-90-arkonik/">This Billet Silver</a> over black hand-stitched leather example is powered by a 2.5L Land Rover 200Tdi turbo-diesel four-cylinder engine, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. With only 3,104 miles on the clock, this incredible example is ready for a new owner.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1990-land-rover-defender-90-arkonik/">Making this example</a> unique, this Land Rover was received by Arkonik in Somerset, England and was torn down to the original steel frame. From there, it was totally restored and rebuilt with extra durability in mind, inspired by Land Rover's "2 Millionth Defender" this Arkonik D90 . Exterior works includes a steel bumper, a metal Puma hood, NAS rear step, and tons more.
