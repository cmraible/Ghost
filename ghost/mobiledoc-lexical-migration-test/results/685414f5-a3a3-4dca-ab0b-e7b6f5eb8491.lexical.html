<p>When you’re one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/clapton-ferraris/">most successful rock musicians of all time</a>, you enjoy access to all kinds of things others only dream about. This includes <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/googled-celebrity-collections/">exotic and ultra-luxurious cars</a>, both of which Pete Townshend of The Who has indulged in big time. In the British <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/musicians-car-collection/">musician’s collection</a> are some amazing rides which are enough to turn anyone green with envy.</p>

<p>Like any proper British citizen, Pete Townshend definitely enjoys Jaguars. The man even wrote a song about his beloved 1966 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/immaculate-1964-jaguar-e-type-series-i-available-now/">Jaguar E-Type</a>, called “Jaguar” of all things. In fact, the song lyrics include the Jaguar slogan “grace, space, and pace.”</p>
<p>While not quite as “proper” of an automobile, perhaps more fitting to Townshend’s professional persona was his 1965 Volkswagen Transporter, a vehicle which has come to represent the Bohemian nature of the decade. However, in 2008 he traded it for a modern VW Transporter since it was faster, more modern, and more pleasant to take out on the road. This just proves Townshend is also a practical man and not just a romantic.</p>
<p>When it comes to weird, Townshend delivered big time with a 1935 Packard hearse which he parked in the street at night. The neighbors were so upset they had authorities tow it. The man also saved for six years to buy a 1965 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1975-maybach-limo/">Mercedes S600 Pullman</a>, which was the most expensive car in the world for a time. The limousine is huge and has been the favorite of many despotic world leaders, plus a British rock star.</p>

<p>Pete Townshend is a huge Ferrari nut, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/clapton-ferraris/">like many other celebrities</a>. The Italian automaker has created some of the most exclusive, tantalizing cars out there. Among his collection is a 1972 Ferrari 365 Daytona Spider, one of only seven right-hand-drive models ever made, which he purchased for himself on his 60th birthday. At the other end of the spectrum as far as newness is a 2001 Ferrari 550 Barchetta, a limited-edition car created to celebrate the 70th birthday of Pininfarina.</p>

<p>On the calmer end of the spectrum is Townshend’s 2016 Bentley Mulsanne Speed. For most people the big limousine is still pretty fast, considering it has a 6.8-liter V8 capable of pushing the vehicle from 0-62 mph in 4.8 seconds. It’s also packed with the kinds of luxuries someone who lives the high life would want surround them.</p>
