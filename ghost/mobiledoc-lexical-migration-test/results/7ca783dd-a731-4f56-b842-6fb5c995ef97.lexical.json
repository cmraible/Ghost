I could have fixed most of that in iMovie, but I decided not to, for testing purposes. The camera shake isn’t too bad, given that the footage is hand-held in cold conditions, and could be stabilised even more in iMovie, if I’d wanted. \n\nThat all said, I’m reasonably pleased with the results. It’s that bit more complex than the Flip HD models, and that does slow you down on occasions, but the results are usually worth it. \n\nI need to give it a test run with an external microphone next.\n\n</div>\n"
