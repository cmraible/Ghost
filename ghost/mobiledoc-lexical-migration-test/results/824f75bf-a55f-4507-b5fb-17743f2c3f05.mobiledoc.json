          "*Updated Story* An exceptionally clean 1991 Honda NSX - that's a JDM-spec, first-production-year model - crossed the auction block at GAA Classic Car Auctions with no reserve. When the bidding stopped, a lucky individual scooped the car for a mere $36,000. While the exact market value of the car could be debated, that price is well below most estimates. With NSX values on the rise, whomever grabbed this supercar got a tremendous deal. "

But this Honda NSX wears it well. Maybe it’s because of those alluring, exotic lines which absolutely blew everyone away at the beginning of the 90s. Or it could be the black roof and 17-inch Enkei aluminum wheels providing the right accent, so that silver paint appears sharper. Whatever it is, the paint on this Japanese supercar looks great."
