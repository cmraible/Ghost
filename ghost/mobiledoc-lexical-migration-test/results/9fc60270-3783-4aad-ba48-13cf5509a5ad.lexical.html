<hr>
<p>Until very recently, Japanese car aficionados simply weren't allowed to sit at the cool kid's table of car collectors. Things have thankfully changed now, and <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444147/2000-honda-s2000-convertible/&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">collectible Japanese cars</a> are starting to get the attention they deserve from the collector community.</p>
<p>We're sure that this 2000 Honda S2000 will help to change attitudes substantially. It's set to cross the auction block as part of <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444147/2000-honda-s2000-convertible/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Mecum Auctions' Kissimmee 2021 sale</a>, which runs from January 7 through January 16.</p>

<p>So, what makes <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444147/2000-honda-s2000-convertible/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this particular S2000</a> so special? It has just 34 miles. You read that correctly – not 34,000, just 34, period. That's pretty much delivery mileage.</p>
<p>As the story goes, it was one of two S2000s owned by a woman who loved her first one so much that she <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444147/2000-honda-s2000-convertible/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">bought a second example</a> to preserve for posterity. She drove the other frequently, but kept this one off the road – still always ready to go at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>It's expected to sell for between $125,000 and $150,000 according to the pre-auction estimate. Given the devotion of <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444147/2000-honda-s2000-convertible/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Honda S2000</a> fans, it may demand even more.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why car fans love the Honda S2000. It's combination of a powerful, high-revving, normally-aspirated engine, a tremendously well-balanced rear wheel drive chassis, and open-top thrills <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444147/2000-honda-s2000-convertible/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">would appeal to anyone</a> who loves cars and driving.</p>
