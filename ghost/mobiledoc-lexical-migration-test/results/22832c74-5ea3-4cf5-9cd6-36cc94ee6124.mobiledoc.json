          ", many have tried to copy the 1976 AMC Pacer. It’s easy to see why, considering the car was used in iconic scenes like when Garth, Wayne, and friends jam out to Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. After so many imitations, the original car used for filming is crossing the auction block later this month and it’s causing quite the buzz across the internet. Even non-gearheads are getting excited about this Pacer and what it represents, so we expect bidding to be fierce."

Other modifications were made to this classic, including modified rear wheelhouses so speaker boxes could be installed, quarter-inch steel plates welded to the rocker panels for the camera supports, and a hole drilled in the roof for that licorice dispenser featured in the movie."
