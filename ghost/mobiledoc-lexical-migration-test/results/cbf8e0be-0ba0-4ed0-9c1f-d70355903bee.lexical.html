<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/narratively/narratively">Another long-form journalism Kickstarter</a>:</p>
<div></div>> <div>Narratively slows down the news cycle. Each week, we’ll explore a different theme about New York and publish a series of connected stories — just one a day — told in the most appropriate medium for each piece. We might feature a longform article with portrait photos on a Monday, followed by an animated documentary on Tuesday, then a photo essay, an audio piece or a short documentary film. Every story gets the space and time it needs to have an impact. We’ll bring you weeks devoted to New York’s waterways, hustlers, sexual subcultures, obscure pastimes and countless other themes. We’ll even get you involved in theme and story selection. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Efforts like this and [Matter](http://readmatter.com) suggest to me that we’re seeing a push-back against the quicker, faster, more sensational style of online news, and a resurgence of the deeper, longer sensibilities of the feature writer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>About time, too. </div>
