The actual modifications appear to be far more than just filling in the rear doors, though, as it looks like the custom build combined the '67 Chevelle wagon's factory roof and D-pillar with the front doors from an El Camino, the side windows of the 1964-65 Chevelle two-door wagon and a custom B-pillar. To maintain a factory look, this car even retains its rallye wheels and a period correct interior."
