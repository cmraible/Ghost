While such a crusade certainly can cut down on lawlessness, in Australia police are talking up an even more budget-friendly and scalable approach by using drones to target miscreants gathering to break the law by “hooning” as they say Down Under."

That’s not to say it doesn’t happen because it does. But police in Tasmania are trying to really talk up the practice in a bid to discourage such lawless behavior."

Not all of those were for illegal car activities. We’d be willing to bet searches for missing persons, tracking suspects fleeing the police, surveying crash sites, etc. made up the majority of usage. Still, an assistant commissioner for police said “hooning” is still a “key concern” for the department."

A similar phenomenon is taking place in the United States with the Department of Justice talking up Unmanned Aerial Systems or drones as part of an “ever-expanding suite of solutions for law enforcement agencies across the country.” Don’t sat we didn’t warn you."

As with all things there’s a balance, but one thing is for sure, we should see more drones playing roles in locating and helping to bust those who decide to turn public roads into raceways and drift parks."
