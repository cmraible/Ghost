<p>You don't want to miss this one: Tonight at 7:30pm ET (4:30pm PT), <em>The Lever</em>’s supporting subscribers will join in as David Sirota leads a discussion with New York Assemblyman Ron Kim (D), Pennsylvania state Senator Katie Muth (D), and former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Ted Siedle about history's largest upward transfer of wealth from workers to Wall Street. And it's all happening in secret.</p>
<p>As <em>The Lever</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/wall-streets-biggest-secret-could-be-exposed/"> reported this week</a>, Kim recently introduced legislation that would require financial firms to disclose what they are doing with hundreds of billions of dollars of Americans’ retirement savings. Separately, Muth is<a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-pension-official-blows-the-whistle/"> suing the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System</a> to ascertain information regarding the pension fund’s high-risk, high-fee investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate. Join us as <em>The Lever </em>speaks with Kim and Muth, as well as Siedle, a prominent securities expert and pension whistleblower, about the reinvigorated effort to protect workers’ pensions.</p>
<p>Like all our live chats, the event is exclusively for <em>Lever</em> supporting subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcast live, ask questions in real time, and watch a replay of the event.</p>
