They chose a color which looks vintage enough, but the fact there’s a clearcoat over the discolored areas is the dead giveaway. The virtually perfect chrome isn’t, because some people will keep a weathered body untouched on a classic while dressing up the trim – a trend that yet again doesn’t please everyone."

An aftermarket steering wheel sits on the tilt column, while white-faced Dolphin gauges have been wedged into the factory diamond-shaped cluster, so some of the vintage appeal has been preserved. Vintage Air heat and AC keep the cab nice and comfortable for year-round use, if that’s your pleasure."
