Take the luxurious and underpowered Cadillacs, throw a V on the badge and fit it with a drivetrain inspired by the top-of-the-line Corvette. This garnered a lot of new attention to the brand, especially from the younger crowd."

It has a 668-horsepower engine that sends the CT5-V to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds. With a 200 mph top speed, this is unlike the Cadillacs your grandfather used to drive."
