<p>The Grand National actually debuted in '82, but most don't realize because these cars were not painted black. All started out as charcoal gray Regals that were shipped off to Cars and Concepts of Brighton, Michigan.</p>
<p>215 Regals with the GN package were made. Special paint and front air dam and rear spoiler were installed.</p>
<p>The car was aptly named for the NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series where Buick won the Manufacturer's Cup in 1981 and 1982 leaving Buick to capitalize on its winnings.</p>
<p>The car came with a naturally aspirated 4.1L V6 engine producing 125hp and 205 lb-ft of torque. A handful of the 215 GN's were based on the Buick Regal Sport Coupe package with the turbocharged 3.8 V6 engine producing 175hp and 275 lb-ft of torque. The number of cars with both the GN and Sport Coupe packages is estimated to be less than 50.</p>
<p>As a commerorative edition car with production meant to only last a year, the car didn't return in 1983.</p>
<p>That brings us to 1984. Buick was able to show off their new turbocharged 3.8L V6, which brought performance-minded and the younger generation to its showroom floors. The jet black added to its appeal.</p>
<p>To back up its menacing looks, the engine was capable of 200hp and 300 lb-ft of torque. That's 5hp shy of the same year's Corvette.</p>
<p>All black paint, rear spoiler and aluminum wheels with black inserts reminded onlookers it was a force to be reckoned with. The driver was met with a sport steering wheel, upgraded instrument package with a tach and boost gauge on the dash, and sport seats.</p>
<p>Production was limited to 2,000 examples. All were sold with ease.</p>
