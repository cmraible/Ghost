<hr>
<p>We’ve covered before how people have claimed rental car companies have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hertz-settles-car-theft/">erroneously reported their rental car was stolen</a>, resulting in arrests, bench warrants issued, and other <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hertz-customers-arrested-theft/">legal problems</a>. It appears such a thing has happened once more, only this time it involves Avis. A single mother who’s a full-time Uber driver in Los Angeles says she was pulled over and detained by Los Angles County Sheriff’s Department because of the report, so she’s suing the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/enterprise-rent-a-car-employee/">rental car company</a>.</p>

<p>According to Ramona Gutierrez, she was pulled over by six sheriff’s vehicles as she was driving down the freeway on March 22 after she rented a vehicle from Avis since her personal vehicle was in the shop. She claims deputies held her at gunpoint, slamming her to the ground, and roughly handcuffing her, causing injuries to her wrists.</p>
<p>Gutierrez says she tried explaining to deputies the car had been legally rented that day, but they still put her in the back of a police vehicle. Her lawyer explained, “This experience has left her shaken and traumatized, and she is now seeking compensation for her injuries and emotional distress.”</p>
<p>At the time, Gutierrez claims nobody explained to her why she was pulled over and detained, leaving her confused and scared. It was only later she learned someone at Avis had reported the rental car had been stolen. After the incident, Gutierrez claims Avis hasn’t so much as apologized.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gutierrez says she’s so traumatized by the incident she hasn’t been back to work. She has been working as an Uber driver for six years.</p>
<p>We reached out to Avis Budget Group, which owns Avis, Budget Rent A Car, Budget Truck Rental, Payless Car Rental, and Zipcar and they provided the following statement: “We have comprehensive safeguards in place to prevent erroneous police notifications. Unfortunately, in this isolated incident, a customer was stopped by the police and detained because of an error on Avis’s part. Due to ongoing legal action, we cannot comment beyond that.”</p>
