This particular video was taken at the Hockenheimring in Germany and is absolutely fascinating. Early on in the video, it appears that Bollinger has a bit of trouble getting started and then struggles with equipment issues but by the second race he clearly has all the kinks worked out and it is clear that the car has little competition on the track."
