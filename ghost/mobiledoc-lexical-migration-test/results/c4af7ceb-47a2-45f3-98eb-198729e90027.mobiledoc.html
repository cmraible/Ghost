<p>This is Lever Weekly, a recap of our work from the past week. If you only read one email from us all week, this should be it. </p>
<p>The last week was one of the most notable for <em>The Lever</em> to date. Below you will find a breakdown of our reporting, podcasts, videos, and live events that were critical to driving the national conversation in recent days. Following that, we are providing all subscribers with an original column this weekend, written by a member of <em>The Lever</em>, connecting the dots on our coverage to deliver important takeaways.</p>
<p>In this week’s column, Andrew Perez recaps how <em>The Lever</em>’s investigative reporting team helped drive substantially better news coverage of Norfolk Southern’s hazardous train derailment in eastern Ohio. <strong>(Scroll to the bottom to read the column.)</strong></p>

<h3 id="driving-the-national-narrative">Driving The National Narrative</h3>
<p>By Andrew Perez</p>
<p>In the days after Norfolk Southern’s fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, corporate media outlets <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/cable-news/study-national-television-coverage-east-palestine-train-derailment-ignored-industry">largely ignored</a> the real story, covering it as some random accident rather than the inevitable byproduct of the railroad industry’s emphasis on rewarding shareholders over public safety.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, that’s no longer the case — and that’s because <em>The Lever </em>team has been churning out powerful investigative story after story, providing necessary context about the lax regulatory environment and earnings-obsessed corporate culture that created the right conditions for this type of avoidable, toxic disaster.</p>
<p>First, we revealed how Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/">watered down and then killed</a> regulations mandating that railroads start replacing the Civil War-era braking systems on some hazmat trains with electronic brakes that experts say could have averted or mitigated the Ohio derailment.</p>

<p>And we revealed that the Ohio train wasn’t being regulated as a "high-hazard flammable train,” thanks to a chemical industry lobbying campaign — even though the train was hauling huge amounts of flammable, carcinogenic chemicals that necessitated local evacuations. Crews ultimately chose to release and burn those chemicals, creating a toxic mushroom cloud over eastern Ohio, instead of allowing the tank cars holding them to explode.</p>
<p>Our reporting helped shift the narrative and drive national coverage. As <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ohio-train-disaster-deregulation-norfolk-southern_n_63ed16abe4b0255caaefab8a"><em>HuffPost</em> put it</a>, “The railroad industry’s history of fighting stricter safety regulations, which investigative news outlet <em>The Lever</em> first reported last week, is taking center stage in the wake of a fiery derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in rural eastern Ohio.”</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em>’s reporters fielded nonstop interview requests this week — appearing on shows ranging from <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ohio-train-disaster-a-tale-of-corporate/id1583132133?i=1000599729364">The Problem with Jon Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2023/2/17/norfolk_southern_east_palestine_derailment">Democracy Now!</a>, to <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/ohio-train-derailment-reveals-structural-issues-on-the-media">On The Media</a>. They were even asked to write a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/opinion/ohio-train-derailment-safety-regulation.html"><em>New York Times</em> column</a> about what can be done to improve rail safety.</p>
<p>Our team managed to fit in all of these appearances as they continued to work around the clock reporting more stories — like one about how the Biden administration <a href="__GHOST_URL__/bidens-doj-backing-norfolk-southern-case-to-block-lawsuits/">has backed Norfolk Southern’s fight</a> at the Supreme Court to shut down lawsuits.</p>
<p>Our reporting forced <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/170658/biden-officials-hesitate-update-rail-brake-guidelines-fear-pushback">White House officials</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pretends-hes-powerless-to-reduce-derailment-risks/">Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg</a> to respond. Unfortunately, instead of pressing right now to markedly improve rail safety standards, they’ve stumbled to explain why they’re not doing that — <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/buttigieg-palestine-train-disaster-paralysis-after-the-east-palestine-disaster-is-a-gift-to-hard-right/">giving the far right an opportunity</a> to push their own false and dangerous narratives.</p>
<p>Environmental groups have said they <a href="__GHOST_URL__/enviros-threaten-legal-action-if-buttigieg-doesnt-act/">may take legal action</a> if the Transportation Department doesn’t act on the groups’ appeal of the Trump administration’s decision to overturn the brake rule.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>The point of the journalism we do here at <em>The Lever</em> is to report important stories that aren’t told in corporate media, and to create the right conditions moving forward so that the public can hold politicians and powerful interests accountable.</p>
<p>We don’t know yet what will happen with the railroads — and whether politicians and regulators will finally force them to get their act together and prioritize public safety over short-term profits. It’s hard to imagine that prospect, but it’s with that hope that we do the work.</p>
<p>For now, we are grateful that people are paying attention and asking the right questions — and we’ll keep doing what we do best: exposing how corporate interests influence policy to the detriment of people like the residents of East Palestine, Ohio, and all around the globe.</p>
