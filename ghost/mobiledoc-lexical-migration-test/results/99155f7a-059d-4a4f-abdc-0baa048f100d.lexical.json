They ran a piece recently about used car price inflation, which apparently won’t go down, because thus sayeth Business Insider. The opening two sentences are meant to drive that hot take right through your heart: “Not too long ago, you could pick up a worn but decent used car for something like $5,000 and hit the road. Those days may be long gone.” You hear that? The days of buying an affordable car are over, peasants! As they say in journalism, if it bleeds it leads. Saying that this awful situation will never turn around might be generating clicks, but why would used car prices continue to stay this high?",

But we would be paying high prices for just about everything else, so it wouldn’t be solely about the used car market anymore but instead the entire US economy. Like we’ve reported before, the price inflation supposedly was caused by a convergence of some unique conditions, most of them imposed by the pandemic and strict government restrictions slapped on a good portion of the country. As those conditions change and go back to normal, why would used car prices persist on their completely insane trajectory if those prices were fueled by factors which have reversed? It makes zero sense. Saying that doesn’t get the clicks, yet here I am.",
