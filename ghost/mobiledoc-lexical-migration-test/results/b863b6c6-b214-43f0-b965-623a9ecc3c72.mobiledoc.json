One of the main stars is his Dodge Charger Hellcat, which the guy likes to drift both on private property and on public roads. If you look at his channel, he’s had run-ins with the law in the past, but this time instead of just getting a warning or citation, the man’s Hellcat was impounded."

His videos show him drifting the Hellcat around other cars on public roads, and from the looks of things these aren’t people who are in on the stunt, so he’s putting innocent people in danger. The guy also likes to do smokey donuts in public intersections, similar to those street takeovers we’ve covered in the past. Something bad is going to happen one day and it could seriously injure or kill this kid or even worse someone who has nothing to do with his stupid decisions."

Everyone makes stupid decisions and you should learn from them. Instead of realizing he should find a legal way to have fun with his car, he’s whining and acting like a victim. Then he asks people to contribute to a fund to pay for his impound fees and many tickets."
