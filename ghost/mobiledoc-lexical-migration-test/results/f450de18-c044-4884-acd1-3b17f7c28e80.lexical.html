<hr>
<p>Jaguar’s E-Class was a <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1965-jaguar-xke-roadster-14/">revolutionary vehicle</a> that changed the way cars were made. It featured sleek, smooth body lines that were created for beauty as much as they were for aerodynamics and a large displacement in-line six-cylinder engine that was both efficient and powerful. On top of being <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1965-jaguar-xke-roadster-14/">admired by enthusiasts</a> and competition alike, the car was mechanically way ahead of its time with features such as disc brakes, rack and pinion steering, and a fully independent suspension system.</p>
