That hue is called “Rotten Avocado” and is paried with a custom-painted “Gold School” Shaker hood scoop, tone-on-tone side striping, staggered 20-inch Forgeline wheels, plus a Mopar coil-over suspension lowering kit. Oh, plus Mopar went so far as to bolt on a cold-air intake and throw in some wood panel trim for the interior along with some green and yellow seat inserts as a tribute to the 1970 Challenger.

Oh, there are also some LED lights and an Expertec bed-slide system, which is nice but nothing you haven’t seen before. The only other really notable detail is the 2-inch lift and FOX shocks.
