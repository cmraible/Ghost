<hr>
<p>In 1993, the automaker <a href="https://cdccasper.tapkat.org/wina40thanniversarycorvette?promo=MOT1">celebrated the car’s 40th</a> year milestone with a Ruby Red example that was truly stunning. It featured a Ruby Red Metallic finish over a matching leather interior, special exterior badging, and embroidered seats. Under the hood was a 5.7-liter engine that pushed 300-horsepower through a 4-speed O/D automatic transmission. Falling in the middle of the fourth generation with on plans from GM for a mid-cycle facelift, the <a href="https://cdccasper.tapkat.org/wina40thanniversarycorvette?promo=MOT1">40th Anniversary Edition</a> did not differ a whole lot from the regular production models as far as performance is concerned. However, it was a stunning package that has proved to be highly collectible.</p>
