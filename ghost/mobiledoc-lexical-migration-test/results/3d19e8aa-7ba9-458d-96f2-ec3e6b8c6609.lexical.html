<p>In the wake of the Supreme Court’s monumental decision to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, many major corporations publicly announced their intention to help facilitate their workers’ out-of-state access to safe abortion care.</p>
<p>While that might seem like a positive development in support of workers’ health and safety, as we highlight below in an article from <em>In These Times</em>, this move ultimately gives bosses even greater power over their employees — in a country where employer-sponsored health care is already as American as apple pie.</p>

We’re Going Somewhere Worse</strong></a></strong>(The New Yorker) — <em>“‘We won’t go back’ — it’s an inadequate rallying cry, prompted only by events that belie its message. But it is true in at least one sense. The future that we now inhabit will not resemble the past before Roe, when women sought out illegal abortions and not infrequently found death. The principal danger now lies elsewhere, and arguably reaches further. We have entered an era not of unsafe abortion but of widespread state surveillance and criminalization… of anyone who comes into meaningful contact with a pregnancy that does not end in a healthy birth.” </em></p>

Blame It On Corporate Greed.</strong></a></strong>(Vice) — <em>“Basically, some economists, including those who can speak directly to the president, have looked at the scary financial landscape — the lasting impact of COVID-19, a war in Ukraine that severely limited oil and grain supply, record corporate profits — and decided that the real problem here is that American wages are too high and stimulus checks sent in the mail early in the pandemic were too big. However, it’s becoming increasingly clear that inflation is driven by corporations taking advantage of the pandemic to increase profits.”</em></p>
