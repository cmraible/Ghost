This process is laboriously intensive as it takes hundreds of man hours to bring these Mustang bodies back to their former glory. A restored donor steel tub is still needed for this all-new model as it will be fitted with the carbon fiber body panels. SpeedKore performs a blue light scan of the entire GT500CR body which creates a 3D model, and then molds are cut using a five-axis CNC machine. Plugs and panels are then pulled using carbon fiber that is good enough for aerospace. Afterwards, these carbon fiber body panels need to be cured, so they sit inside a large autoclave located in-house. Produced to exact specifications, these incredibly high-quality carbon fiber bodies are stronger than those made of steel, and it features a flawless carbon fiber weave alignment.
