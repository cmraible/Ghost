Let’s keep in mind this guy, who’s name is Mike, not only bought this “modern General Lee” so he can jump it eventually, but also jumped his brand new Ram TRX with disastrous results. Pretty much he’s a bad idea with legs so naturally the internet finds him supremely entertaining."

At least it’s not a Hemi car so it’s not as big of a loss, but who just keeps wrecking vehicles to get likes online?"
