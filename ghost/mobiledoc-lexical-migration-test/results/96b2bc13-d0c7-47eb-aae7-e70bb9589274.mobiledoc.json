So much so that the Corvette was banned from showroom stock events, which lead to the creation of the single-make Corvette Challenge spec racing series. This series existed in 1988 and 1989 pitting drivers such as Andy Pilgrim, John Greenwood, Tommy Kendall, Boris Said, Paul Tracey and even Bruce Jenner against each other in identically prepared cars for a chance to win $1 million. In 1989, Chevrolet built just 60 of these cars, and the one you see here is special since it was never raced and was used as a show car to market the series. "

There are just over 16,000 original miles, and all of the paint, interior pieces and decals look brand new.
