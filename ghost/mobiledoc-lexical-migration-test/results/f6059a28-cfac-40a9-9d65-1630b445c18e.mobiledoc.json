For example, they’ve had to carefully remove the thin, brittle wood trim pieces in the cramped interior, a process which has been painstakingly slow. Wires stowed behind panels are brittle to the touch. A special preparation process is necessary before painting the magnesium alloy wheels their original factory color. The process started in 2020 and likely won’t be complete for some time."

Most people associated the brand with affordable, fuel-efficient hatchbacks as well as boxy, rugged off-roaders, so the sexy sports car was about shifting preconceived notions. From the time it was first revealed at the 1965 Tokyo Motor Show it did just that, both on the road and on the movie screen as even James Bond got in on the action."

However, it did exceed many people’s expectations of what a Japanese sports car could do, opening the door to more performance vehicles from the island nation. Even Carroll Shelby was convinced as he entered 2 modified versions of the sports car in the 1968 SCCA production car series."
