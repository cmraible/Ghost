Here's one that hits the nail on the head, and is discounted for veterans and active military personnel.</h3>

<p>There’s an added bonus for active duty military personnel and army veterans, too. Driver Motorsports is proud to offer a $500 discount to those who have served, and continue to serve, in the name of the country. <br><br><strong>More Japanese Greats!</strong><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/missing-1982-mazda-le-mans-254i-racer-has-been-found">Missing 1982 Mazda Le Mans 254i Racer Has Been Found</a><br><a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/304556/why-the-mazda-mx-5-miata-is-still-an-icon-30-years-on">Why The Mazda MX-5 Miata Is Still An Icon 30 Years On</a></p>
<p>Power is rated at 252 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque, allowing for a top speed well beyond 150mph, and a 0-60mph time of around 5.1 seconds. For those after a complete package, the vehicle’s aesthetics perfectly match those rapid performance figures.</p>

<p>While certain Mazda RX7s are subjected to body kits penned by Blind Bob McBlind and installed using telepathy, this one has been discerningly modified without the encroaching wrath of Walmart-<em>Fast-and-Furious</em> syndrome. <br><br>Up front is a new bumper, mated to Mazdaspeed GTC side skirts and vented widebody front fenders. There’s also Mazdaspeed headlight covers and rear wing, BN Sports Rear Over Fenders, and an aftermarket rear bumper. For the perfect sound, a Fujitsturbo exhaust has been fitted, allowing a deep-seated bout of jealousy to build within any gearhead on your street.</p>

<p>The car’s stance rests upon Auto Exe lowering springs and oh-so-glorious Rays Volk CE28 wheels. The stylish customisation continues within the cabin, where a Momo competition steering wheel, Recaro Sport racing seat, and flocked dashboard complete the package.</p>
<p>As the ultimate driver’s car, boasting a 5-speed transmission capable of squeezing every rev from the 1.3-liter Wankel engine, very little can match the sheer adrenaline offered up here. The best bit? All of this is 100% road legal, with customs cleared and all importation documents sorted out.
