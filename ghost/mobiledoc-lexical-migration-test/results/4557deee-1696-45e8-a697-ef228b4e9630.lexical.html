<p>Good things are happening! Amazon‚Äôs CEO got knocked for his anti-union media messages. Meanwhile, grassroots organizing efforts are giving people a way to regain control over energy decisions. Also, a Cold War-era treaty that fossil fuel companies have used to stifle climate action is coming undone, and New York City‚Äôs largest borough just started the nation‚Äôs most ambitious composting initiative.</p>

<h3 id="nlrb-stands-up-to-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy">NLRB Stands Up To Amazon CEO Andy Jassy</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a complaint against Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, charging him with violating labor law by disparaging unions in two media interviews this year. On air, Jassy has repeatedly claimed that Amazon employees would be better off without a union, in a blatant attempt to undermine union organizers gaining momentum in the company‚Äôs warehouses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese plutocrats will no longer threaten workers in interviews with the media,‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/SethGoldstein13/status/1585433021724901377">said</a> Amazon Labor Union (ALU) attorney Seth Goldstein in response to the filing. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre being held accountable.‚Äù</p>

<p>The complaint is one of several filed by the NLRB against the corporate behemoth this year. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/business/economy/amazon-labor-union-nlrb.html">In September,</a> regulators fought back against an Amazon policy that dictates how employees can use ‚Äúnonwork areas,‚Äù arguing that the rule is disproportionately used to quell ALU‚Äôs union activity. Recent federal support has been an important tool for grassroots organizers standing up against some of the most powerful corporations in the world.</p>

<p>A recent <em>Canary Media</em><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-equity/power-by-the-people-week-introduction-overview">report</a> shed light on the various ways people all over the country are shaping the clean energy transition in their communities by using overlooked tools such as community-owned solar while utilities and the state have failed to deliver solutions.</p>
<p>Solar initiatives from <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-equity/building-resilient-communities-soulardaritys-plan-for-energy-democracy">Highland Park, Michigan</a>, to <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/how-neighborhoods-are-banding-together-to-get-cheaper-rooftop-solar">Houston, Texas</a>, which involve co-ops and neighbors banding together for buying power, are lowering energy costs and giving folks a say in how their cities can build reliable and equitable energy.

The growing number of countries withdrawing from the treaty will help strip fossil fuel companies of their power to block or discourage drilling bans and climate planning.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe ECT fully embodies the rules and institutions of globalization in the 1990s and 2000s that delay, increase the cost of or block the energy transition," Maxime Combes, an economist with the International Organization of Technicians, Experts and Researchers, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2022/10/22/france-withdraws-from-the-energy-charter-treaty-to-meet-its-climate-ambitions_6001322_114.html">told</a><em>Le Monde</em>. "It allows investors to sue states that decide to shut down coal-fired power plants or manage support mechanisms for renewable energies more carefully, which they need to do."</p>
<h3 id="nyc%E2%80%99s-queens-becomes-compost-king">NYC‚Äôs Queens Becomes Compost King</h3>
<p>With 2.2 million residents, Queens is New York City‚Äôs largest borough. As of this month, it is also home to the biggest curbside <a href="https://grist.org/beacon/page/5/">composting initiative</a> in the country, marking the first time New York will provide free composting services to an entire borough.</p>
<p>Climate pollution from food waste is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/02/25/climate-curious-food-waste/">greater</a> than that produced by the airline industry. In order to reduce NYC‚Äôs emissions, Queens residents will be able to toss their food, food-soiled paper, and yard waste ‚Äî all of which account for about a third of landfill waste ‚Äî into bins provided by the state‚Äôs Department of Sanitation.</p>
