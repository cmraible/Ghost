Some of the tallest tales told back in the day surrounded the Mustang SSP or Special Service Package for the Fox Body. Developed thanks to a special project conducted with the California Highway Patrol in 1982, these were used in other states like Florida."

          "A lot of people were fearful of these SSP Mustangs because they believed cops could use them to catch anything on the road. No doubt this perception was fueled in part by law enforcement as they sought to discourage people from making a run for it. Avid Mustang fans might have added some fuel to the fire, especially once they learned CHP passed on using the Camaro for high-speed enforcement, which was a major chest-beating moment for them."

Others were just black with minimal cosmetic modifications, meaning they were stealthy in comparison to other cop vehicles. That added to the terror element for those who liked to break the law on the open road."

Well, we kind of get to see, because the one in question has been modified, so it’s not just like what the cops were running back in the 80s. Still, it’s interesting to see just what kind of power this thing is throwing down and how it compares to the Mustangs and other muscle cars of today."
