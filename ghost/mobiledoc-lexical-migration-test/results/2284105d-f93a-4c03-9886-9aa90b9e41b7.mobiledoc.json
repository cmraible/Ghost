We can’t confirm it’s a factory color, but it certainly looks period-correct, so we wouldn’t be surprised if it is. Chrome graces certain trim pieces, a brow sits over the split windshield (both desirable attributes these days), the GMC lettering on the tailgate looks freshly painted in white, and treated wood graces the bed as well as extends above the sides of the payload. Even the badges, hubcaps, and wheels are factory originals. While not perfect, it’s obvious this GMC has been lovingly restored and cared for since."

In other words, this isn’t a problem truck people play hot potato with, passing it from one unfortunate party to another. It was apparently sitting in a barn, although thankfully it’s not longer in barn-find condition."
