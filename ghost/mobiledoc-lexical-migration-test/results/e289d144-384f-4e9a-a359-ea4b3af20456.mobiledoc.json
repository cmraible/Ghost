          " will quickly realize how much it relies on its narrative. 80% of the game consists of moving your character and interacting with objects or other characters. The other 20% are small spurts of simple gameplay in which you instead pilot a drone to interact with objects or characters, or aim a laser to shoot at robots. This normally would not be a problem, but what gameplay is present is uninspired. Characters cannot make tight turns when moving faster than a walk, the inability to move at varying speeds makes the drones difficult to accurately control and the lack of impact and weight when firing the lasers makes them unsatisfying.

          "There is a lot to appreciate about this game, both what’s shown to you and what’s revealed in subtext. The game gives you the ability to “examine” items or people, which brings up a small bio about what you are looking at. When playing as Richard, examining things will give you a generalized overview of what the examined subject is. When playing as Adam, you will get a generalized overview of how the examined subject relates to Adam specifically. At first, when I examined Adam’s son, John, and read “your son is the most important person in your life, make sure he is always happy and taken care of,” I felt as though the game was trying to get me to care about its characters without putting in the effort to do so naturally. However as the game progresses, and you find out the truths about Adam and how John fits into the narrative, this detail specifically makes a lot of sense in hindsight. "

          " uses low-poly character models set in realistic environments. While this is definitely a unique choice which sets itself apart from other games and I did just applaud it for its significance in the narrative, that does not mean I enjoyed this decision. The irregular juxtaposition of jagged edges on a person while they walk through a city with smooth letters on the signs around them and detailed bricks on the buildings can come off as awkward at best, and abrasively ugly at worst. Under certain lights when every single polygon on a character’s face is shaded differently, it makes characters that are supposed to be beautiful in-universe come off as hideous. Not only that, but neither age nor emotion can be conveyed well in this art style. In a scene where Adam is watching a moment from Richard’s past, he needs to comment that Richard looks younger because you would not have been able to tell otherwise. In a narrative driven game, immersion into its world is paramount for making you care about what’s happening, so it’s a shame that the game’s own art style is immersion-breaking."

          "What upsets me most is that this visual choice is not consistent. All characters are low-poly, but so are the vehicles. When I saw this, I thought all humans and things man-made are low-poly, however the buildings are not. Since buildings are just as man-made as cars, the only thing I could think of to find consistency was that things that need to be animated are low-poly, and things that do not need to be animated are realistic. If it were not for the fact that so many elements of this game are purposeful, I would think that the art direction was chosen to save money. I don’t believe that is the case, however it’s a tempting thought to consider. "

Those familiar with the RPG while not familiar with the actor will still recognize him, as I’m almost certain that the voice director asked him “Can you please do Geralt?” This was definitely a purposeful decision as Geralt’s voice is not Doug’s natural speaking voice. While Doug is talented and his performance is great, I feel the voice does not match the character. Richard is supposed to be an everyman, in over his head as he tries to make his way through the chaos he’s thrust in. The fact that he sounds like a gravelly voiced, combat-hardened man is a poetic mirror of the mistakes made in the visual design. The rest of the main cast does a good job, while the supporting roles could have used a few more takes. "
