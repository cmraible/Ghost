<p>Ford has a rich racing history surrounding its iconic GT40 that won "24 Hours of LeMans" four consecutive times from 1966-1969. Decades later, Ford unveiled a GT40 concept car at the Detroit Auto Show back in 2002, and it hyped up car enthusiasts for the possibility of a production mid-engine racecar. Shortly after, Ford released its plan to produce a different version of the GT40 concept car, and the first-gen Ford GT was born.

<p>In the early 1960s, Pontiac’s development team along with John DeLorean, Bill Collins, and Russ Gee discovered a loophole in the GM A-body engine displacement rule that had previously limited the Pontiac Tempest to a standard 326-cid 5.3-liter V8 engine. This legendary move created an iconic car and an ever revered segment in the American automotive marketplace.

<p>The Ford Mustang has proven itself more than capable of keeping up with the pony car competition over the years since its conception. Models such as the GT350 and GT500 stunned fans across the nation with their passion for speed and low quarter-mile times on the drag strip. We suppose this was expected since they were built by one of racing’s most respected drivers and builders, Carroll Shelby. Known for producing some of the world’s quickest track monsters, such as the A/C Cobra, utilizing Ford engines to do something that everyone thought was absolutely impossible, he made the Mustang fast. Anyone with a passion for automotive history will tell you exactly how hard it is to find a true Shelby example on the classic car market, but you might be in luck with this vehicle.

<p>Porsche is possibly the most iconic and recognizable European automotive brand of the early 1970s for its innate ability to change and grow with the ever-fluctuating restrictions that beseech the automotive industry. These vehicles were somehow able to provide just as much performance and be just as fun to drive as the pre-gas-crisis cars that we all know and love today. Models like the 911 and other variants of the flagship Porsche sports car were taking over the European performance car market, which is why this particular car is an excellent option for any automotive enthusiast looking for some track fun in a Porsche of their own.

Models like the F12, F40, and 250 GTO will live on in the history books as some of the European circuit's most fearsome competitors on land.

Of course, we are not talking about airplanes or spaceships. Instead, this particular vehicle is a sturdy sea-going vessel with all the power of a racing-inspired sports car and the looks of Ferrari's best designers. This is a truly impressive sports boat, and any water sailing enthusiast will be thrilled for the opportunity to own it.
