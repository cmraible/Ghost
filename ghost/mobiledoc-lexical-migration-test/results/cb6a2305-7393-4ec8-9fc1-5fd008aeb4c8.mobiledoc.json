When the world's power shuts off, our cute robot friend must delve through a factory with the mission to bring light back to the world. With electricity running through his body from his head, he's able to activate platforms and currents to progress but after a brief stint in the factory, his head becomes detachable, allowing him to throw it to activate far off pathways. It's a unique ability, making him the only one to solve Earth's problem."
