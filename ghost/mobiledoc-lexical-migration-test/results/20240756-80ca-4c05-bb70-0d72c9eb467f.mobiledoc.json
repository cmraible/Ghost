It’s developed by Imagineer and is a fun fitness game which is accessible for all ages and fitness levels, though is more catered towards people who aren’t already fit but want to be, rather than those who are already fit and don’t need an incentive to do exercise (I’m very much the former)."

I mean I’m generally healthy, but yeah, I’d like to lose a few pounds here and there (don’t we all). However every time I find something that could sound appealing to me, I make an excuse; ‘Oh it’s on Tuesdays and I’m tired on Tuesdays’ or ‘The gym adds an extra 5 minutes onto my journey home from work which kicks my whole daily routine out of sync’.

All you need is Joy-Cons and the TV dock and you can get started (all of which come packaged with a normal Switch console, of course). After inputting your data, you then begin the work out, which of course gets more intense as the days pass. To begin with, you’ll hardly break a sweat but if you keep playing it daily, you’ll soon start to feel the burn. But like I said – at no point have I got bored so far. I mean yes, I’d rather be sitting on my backside exploring Hyrule or whatever but I think if you approach this game with middling expectations, like I did, then you’ll be fine."

The game is fun and has a bubbly outset which it needs to have to keep the participants engaged. The trainers are upbeat and actually make the odd humourous comment which adds to the overall positivity to the game. For example, they get disgruntled if you dress them in certain ways, which is a nice touch. You really can’t fault this game for its energy."

The sound is fun and has that kind of tinny/clangy arcade noise that the Wii exergaming games also had but personally, I like that kind of sound, especially when doing exercise. The music and trainer accents are varied and despite being a game that is repetitive by nature, the sound doesn’t grate on you too much. When I started, I was worried you might find the trainer a bit irritating but fortunately, there are a number of different trainers to choose from so that resolves that issue!"
