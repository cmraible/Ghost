After breaking up with his ex-girlfriend, he’s rumored to be selling all of his cars since she sat in the driver’s seat of each one. To help him buy new cars, which also rumored are supposed to be the same make and model of the vehicles he’s sold, the guy is liquidating his motorcycles. If that’s true, this Hollywood guy is an overly-emotional financial idiot."
