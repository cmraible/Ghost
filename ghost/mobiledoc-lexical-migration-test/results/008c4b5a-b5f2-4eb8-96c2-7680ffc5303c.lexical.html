<p>Having a brand new car might mean you deal with few repairs, and some of those could be covered by the warranty. You also don’t have to deal with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/you-have-to-stare-at-this-chevy-camaro-monstrosity/">anything weird</a> or repaired in a questionable way by the previous owner(s). But, you also can pay <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-riots-are-affecting-the-auto-industry/">a lot more for insurance</a>. If you think it’s just a simple matter of a new car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wildfire-chevy-collection/">being worth more</a>, this issue is actually more complicate, according to a recent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/tips/right-classic-car-insurance/">auto insurance</a> article.</p>
<p>As we’ve pointed out many, many times in the past few months, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">car theft has been a big problem</a> in 2020 and it looks like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">it’s going to get even worse</a>. If you think thieves are just looking for a 1998 Honda Civic, you’re sadly mistaken. According to this insurance article, criminals are targeting newer cars because they can get more for them on the underground market, thanks to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/man-buys-maserati-quattroporte-salvage-title-at-auction/">expensive parts</a> used on them. This means insurance rates for newer cars have to be increased.</p>

<p>Speaking of expensive components, those sensors embedded in bumpers, taillights, etc. tend to get damaged in accidents. That means the cost of repairs can be shockingly high, even for a simple fender bender. Even those fancy ventilated, massaging seats and carbon-fiber parts add to the potential replacement costs <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alpina-z8-crashed/">if something were to happen to your car</a>.</p>
<p>Probably the most surprising factor cited in the article is that many new vehicles can’t <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/old-iihs-car-crash/">withstand a low-impact collision</a> well. This is how a low-speed accident in a parking lot can turn into a repair bill that’s thousands of dollars for a new car, while an older car would maybe only have a dent and some scratches in the paint.</p>
<p>The article also points out how people with new cars carry full insurance coverage and often add extras like gap or full replacement coverage. If you have a really valuable classic car, you might carry quite a bit of insurance on it, but otherwise you’re saving a lot by not opting for full coverage and then some.</p>
<p>All this points out that driving an older car shouldn’t be looked down upon like it unfortunately can be in certain circles.</p>
