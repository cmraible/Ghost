What you probably haven’t heard about is that the brand is looking to hire a Chief Donut Maker and pay that lucky person $150,000 a year to drive a Dodge Challenger Hellcat at events. It’s basically a dream job for us and we can imagine most of you feel the same way, especially since Dodge says it’ll schedule your tire-burning assignments around your day job."

It’ll be interesting to see what kind of a person they choose for this job, whether it’s an average, everyday Joe or if they jump the shark and end up hiring some YouTuber so they can leverage their following."
