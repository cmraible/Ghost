<p>Here's a gem from what <a href="https://martinbelam.com">Martin</a> calls ‚Äúthe cow site‚Äù: Tom Chivers starts talking about the current kerfuffle about the AstraZeneca vaccine, but then segues into breaking down how to report on statistics. For instance:</p>
<blockquote><strong>1) Put numbers into context</strong><br>Ask yourself: is that a big number? If Britain dumps 6 million tons of sewage in the North Sea each year, that sounds pretty bad. But is it a lot? What‚Äôs the denominator? What numbers do you need to understand whether that is more or less than you‚Äôd expect? In this case, for instance, it‚Äôs probably relevant that the North Sea contains 54 thousand billion tons of water.</blockquote>
<p>Well worth reading the whole thing.</p>

<p>There's some sort of kerfuffle brewing over Substack. I've suspected this would happen for a while (<a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/09/cancel-culture-afterlife-glinner-and-substack/">receipts</a>), but I need to do a bit more reading around before I write about it. I might even get to it later today.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-sea-lords-phone">The First Sea Lord's Phone</h3>
<p>Lovely anecdote <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/saturday-13-march-2021/33226/">from John Naughton</a> about visiting 10 Downing Street:</p>
<blockquote>The other thing I remember (it was in the late 1990s) was that on entry you had to switch your mobile phone off and put it on the hall table with a post-it note giving your name. I did as required and went off to do the interview. When I went to reclaim my phone I noticed that next to it was a Nokia on which the post-it note said ‚ÄúFirst Sea Lord‚Äù.<br>Straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan.</blockquote>
