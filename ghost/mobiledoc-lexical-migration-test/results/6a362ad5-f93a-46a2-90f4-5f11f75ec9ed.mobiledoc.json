Reyes claimed a 7-year-old special needs child was left in the car which was idling in a driveway when it was swiped. He did that to speed up the recovery of his beloved pony car, which apparently worked but not in the way he hoped."

All the outrage is directed at Reyes, not the thief, who apparently faces zero consequences for stealing a car. I’m not saying Reyes didn’t do anything wrong, he absolutely did, but perhaps this is part of the reason car thefts are so out of control in cities like New York. Thieves either aren’t charged with a crime or they get a slap on the wrist, then are let back onto the streets to steal again. But the local news really just wants to focus on Reyes and tell you to be outraged about his lie, that’s all. Unbelievable."
