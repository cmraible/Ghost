<p>Clint Eastwood is 91 years old, and has decades worth of work in the entertainment industry.

<p>I want to start with this one, because I think it's the most surprising. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/one-state-is-backing-classic-car-owners/">muscle SUV</a> from 1990s is a cool ride, but it doesn't have a very 'Hollywood' feel to it, and that's not a bad thing. Respect to Clint Eastwood for once telling Jimmy Fallon about the SUV brother the Syclone, another 1990s highlight. </p>

<p>The Austin Healey was the usual choice of people with fat wallets in the 1950s and 1960s, so it's a bit of an oddball that Clint Eastwood has owned. This model earned its name by being able to hit 100 mph - a big deal back when it was made. These cars have proven to be highly-soughtafter collector cars in the last few years.</p>

<p>Eastwood was pals with Burt Reynolds, so him owning a 1977 Trans Am that mirrored the famous Trans Am from Smokey and the Bandit is no surprise, plus, it's one of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-cars-for-sale-kick-off-december/">coolest cars</a> ever. In an interview, Reynolds revealed that he and Eastwood were fired from Universal Studios on the same day. </p>
<p>According to Reynolds, “This is a true story, we were both fired on the same day at Universal Studios, and they told Clint, you know, your Adam’s apple sticks out too far and you won’t get that tooth fixed, that chipped tooth, and you talk too slow. And I said ‘Why are you firing me?’ and they said ‘You can’t act,’” he says.</p>
