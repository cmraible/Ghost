He then replaced the stock engine with a 5.7-liter LS-based engine. Keeping the iron block’s stock bottom-end, he rebuilt the valve train with a BTR twin-turbo camshaft and the pushrods and valve springs to accommodate it. Using expertise he gained from his career as a diesel mechanic, TIG welding skills that he did know he had at the time, and a few components from CX Racing, Nick then incorporated two junkyard sourced series-60 Detroit GT42 turbo into the build. With an ice-water reservoir and an air compressor to control the boost pressure in the trunk, an intercooler under the hood, and a Boost Leash boost controller in the cab, the Monte Carlo has seen boost levels as high as 19-PSI.",
