From here, Comer started his own restoration business operating out of a two-car garage. From what started as humble beginnings expanded into working for well-known car collectors. Not only did he restore cars down to the smallest detail, but he was trusted in assisting with builds from some of the world's top collections.</p>

<p>This desirable 1985 Ford Mustang GT, also publicly known as the "four eye". This Mustang is an extremely well-known car in the Fox-body and MCA community, and it appears virtually as new as it was treated as a show car from Day 1.

Under the hood is the last year of the 4-valve carbureted 5.0-liter HO V8 engine and last year of the roller camshaft, and it is backed by a 5-speed manual transmission. The car features the rare "slick top" with no sunroof or T-tops and it comes with the original Gatorback tires, battery, belts and hoses. It has the original stickers, decals, tags, and factory markings throughout, and it has extensive original paperwork and documentation. MCA President Jeff Mays was the original owner of the car before it was sold to noted collector Terry McCoy.
