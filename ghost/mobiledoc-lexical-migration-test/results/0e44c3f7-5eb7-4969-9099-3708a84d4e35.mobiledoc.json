A homologation special BMW built for the European Touring Car Championship, under 1,300 of the cars were made. Many of these cars came from the factory with extensive lightweighting, although a road car package added more comforts for people not interested in racing. Gleeson has one track-oriented 3.0 CSL in a blue which might have never been applied to another one of its kind."

Even people who don’t like cars know about it, because it was hand painted by the artist, which attracted considerable attention when it debuted since it actually wasn’t officially commissioned by BMW, unlike the other storied Art Cars from the past. That extra little bit of controversy, if that’s what you want to call it, ensured the vehicle got more attention and is now a type of modern legend."

In other words, it makes up in quality what the collection lacks in quantity. The video is just shy of 21 minutes long, but a person could easily get lost in the garage for a few hours while gawking at all the impressive cars."
