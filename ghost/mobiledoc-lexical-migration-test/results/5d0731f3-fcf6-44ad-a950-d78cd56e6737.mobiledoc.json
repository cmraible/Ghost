After 20 years of working as a freelance photographer in outdoor environments all over the world, he had been accustomed to constantly being on the move, surrounded by athletes, clients, collaborators ‚Äì and distractions.\n\nIt was during this period of personal darkness, and following a conversation with his friend and fellow surfer/photographer Nick Pumphrey, that Dawn Days was born. Every morning, Mike was up at 3.30am, pulling on his wetsuit and walking down to the beach with his camera, where he would swim out and capture the dawn.\n\nThe Ripple Effect is a beautifully open and honest reflection from Mike on how this project helped him process his mental health over the pandemic. \n\n\nUnderwater Footage by Mike Guest & Tim Askew \nAdditional Footage by Rob Waugh \nSound Design by Barry Jackson\nDubbing Mixer & Sound Design by Paul Flitcroft\nMusic by David Jack\nColour Grading by Troy Edge",
