While the back end of the car was left wrapped around that pole, the front end was flung 5 houses away, showing what kind of force was behind the collision."

A teenager who was driving the Mopar was left in critical condition. According to local residents interviewed by a reporter, this has been a chronic problem they’re tired of dealing with."

Many have said close calls have almost lead to disaster, both for children and adults. What city officials have been doing about the problem, which includes installing speed humps, obviously isn’t working. Residents want more police patrols, which would require more funding for the police department."

Dodge muscle cars are prime targets, as are other hot rides, including Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawks, Chevy Camaros, and Ford Mustangs. There’s been a lot of talk about why this is such a problem in Motor City, however all that talk hasn’t led to a solution. People in the city are tired not only of their cars being stolen but also of how those vehicles are used in crimes, stripped, and dumped all over, if not violently crashed like this one."

As the teenage driver was racing through the residential area at over 100 mph he clipped an SUV, sending the Challenger into a spin. It appears the backseat passenger wasn’t wearing a seatbelt since they were thrown clear of the wreck. Thankfully, nobody from the neighborhood was hit by the car, but the situation could have easily been far worse."
