It’s truly unfortunate in this case that the association has been put in this situation."

The organization acknowledged that many people from around the world look forward to souvenir sales from the association, an effort which now seems to be surrounded in uncertainty. Same thing goes for the memorabilia published by the New Hampshire nonprofit. With that in mind, they’re digging through the remnants of the office to salvage anything that’s left and hopefully some good items will be available in the near future."
