Much to my surprise, I had to queue for 20 minutes to get in, and this was mid-afternoon. Goodness only knows what it was like that morning.\n\nStill, the store has a pleasing aesthetic, there was a nice atmosphere in the queue, despite the rain, and I got the goods I wanted, despite the crowds.\n\nYou can see all my pics [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adders/sets/41050/).\n\n\n"
