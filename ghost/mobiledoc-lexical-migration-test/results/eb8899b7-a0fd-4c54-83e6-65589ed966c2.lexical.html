<hr>
<p>In 1926, Buick came out with the <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11553895&return_to=%2Finventory%2Findex.php&isResults=false&avId=1143225&pageID=3">Buick Master 55 Opera Coupe</a>, a car that uses its strikingly curvaceous body to draw attention wherever it goes. As is the case with many classic luxury brands, the idea behind Buick's founding seems to have always been about providing people with the kind of comfort that could typically only be found within their home. Without a doubt, that's something that this car does very well with a spacious interior with what looks to be an interesting cross between a bucket and bench seating. Under the hood is a straight-six powerhouse and manual transmission which also adds to the driving experience tying the whole car together quite nicely.</p>

<p>A little bit later in the decade, <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11684041&return_to=%2Finventory%2Findex.php&isResults=false&avId=1140006&pageID=3">Hudson had their</a> car which may have indeed competed with the aforementioned automobile. It was called the <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11684041&return_to=%2Finventory%2Findex.php&isResults=false&avId=1140006&pageID=3">Super-Six</a>, likely because of its six-cylinder J block engine that made accelerating and driving at higher speeds, compared to others like it, more possible for the time. Without a doubt, these were all assets associated with only the best vehicles of the 1920s. Finally, the rumble seating and interior were pretty driver-focused which is an unexpected twist for a car like this.</p>

<p>Overall, the 1920s were a great time for luxury automotive manufacturers and these vehicles show that off pretty well. With all sorts of performance, luxury, and general driving-oriented innovations, they create an appeal, unlike any other vehicles on the road. So it makes sense that you’d want to get your hands on these prices of automotive art and history. The only question is if you’ll be able to before someone else does.</p>
