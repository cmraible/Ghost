Implementation of a **brand new CMS** (we migrated from WordPress to [Ghost](https://ghost.org)) **and comment system** that empowers you, the audience, to engagement on the site in a positive way.\n3. Become a **destination for entrepreneurial resources** with the launch of the **brand new [Resources section](__GHOST_URL__/resources/)** of the site which will feature a collection of helpful resources ranging from recommended downloads to must-read newsletters and articles to must-listen and watch podcasts and videos. If you have recommendations for resources that you think should be added to the section, [let us know](__GHOST_URL__/contact-us/)!\n4. The launch of our very **own membership product: [BestTechie Plus](__GHOST_URL__/plus/)** which offers access to a number of great perks such as access to our **online courses** (including early access to our course on how to become a highly effective business networker), an **ad-free site experience**, access to our **member-only Discord** to meet and communicate with other people in the community (including myself!), as well as access to member-only **discounts and giveaways**, plus much more. You get all that and more with membership, and did I mention, pricing starts at **only $5/month or $40/year**. It's a steal if you ask me!\n5. We're **relaunching the [TechieBytes podcast](__GHOST_URL__/tag/techiebytes/)** too, starting with two brand new episodes that are being released today. Additionally, we're always looking for new and interesting guests, if you or someone you know would be a good guest on the podcast, please [get in touch](__GHOST_URL__/techiebytes-guest-suggestions/)."
