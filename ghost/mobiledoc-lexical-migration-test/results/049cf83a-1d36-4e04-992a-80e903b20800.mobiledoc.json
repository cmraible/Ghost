There are checkpoints throughout the world, and you must manually save at each one to replenish your health, however given how long it takes to save, it would have made a lot more sense if your health could replenish automatically by walking past said checkpoints, rather than needing to wait for 30 seconds or more to heal yourself each time."

Once you explore the area, the silhouette fills-in with colour, thereby demonstrating where you have or haven’t been thus far. Makes sense right? However when you die, that filling-in disappears and the map returns to the silhouette; just… why? Each time I respawned, I also noticed that random bits of the map had been filled-in that I definitely hadn’t visited yet (which does suggest it’s all a bit buggy, so let’s see what happens on release), but if the filling-in does indeed disappear each time you die, it would be a hugely frustrating design choice."
