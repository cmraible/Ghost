<p>Classic British roadsters are about as visceral of a driving experience that you can get, but finding one that is still roadworthy is the tricky part. That's where this immaculate <a href="https://www.jpfrazier.com/vehicles/298/1976-triumph-tr6?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1976 Triumph TR6</a> comes into play with its well-documented two-owner history and excellent condition, and this roadster is up for sale through <a href="https://www.jpfrazier.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Frazier Motorcar Company</a>.</p>

<p>Looking like a flashback to 1976, this TR6 is practically flawless thanks to the extreme care by its two owner over the last 44 years; the car's most recent owner who had it for more than 20 years. The Alpine White paint shows well while the body gaps and chrome are impressive, and the interior is just as clean with an all-black interior accented by wood on the dash and steering wheel. Judging by the pictures, this car is just begging to be driven.</p>
<p>As clean of a condition as this TR6 is in, what really makes it special is the factory dual top setup. While top-down driving is the best way to enjoy a TR6, the like-new soft top is always handy when bad weather pops us, and the paint-matched hardtop ensures that the TR6 can still be driven in the colder months.</p>
<p>The fun-to-drive attitude of this car came from its small size, well-balanced suspension and the Â 2.5-liter inline-six paired to a four-speed manual transmission. This turn-key British roadster needs nothing to be enjoyed today, and it's ready to carve corners or cruise to car shows. </p>
