If you haven’t seen the short film below by Q. Baillieux about the deadly accident at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans, it’s a rare gem. Not only is it a good animated movie involving car culture, it treats a tragedy with artful dignity."

While the deadly crash in France might be painful to remember, it’s better that we do and learn from what happened as well as why. Certainly, nobody wants another 80-plus people dying because a race car lands in the spectator stands at a track."

After all, endurance racingisn’t for the weak-willed, but at the same time when a team member is killed you can’t look the other way, and that duality really comes through in this film. Even with a horrific crash and so many lives lost the race continued when they easily could have called it off, although Mercedes-Benz pulled out."

Yes, there was criticism of that decision back then, but no considerable efforts were made to all-out cancel the 24 Hours of Le Mans as a result."

After all, the man was a race car driver and knew going into the competition what kind of risks he was assuming, yet he still strapped on his helmet and pushed that car to its limits. With 22 hours of the race left, the decision was made by some to carry on."

Switzerland banned circuit racing until 2007. Meanwhile, officials in France decided to increase the distance between spectators and the track to help prevent another tragedy."
