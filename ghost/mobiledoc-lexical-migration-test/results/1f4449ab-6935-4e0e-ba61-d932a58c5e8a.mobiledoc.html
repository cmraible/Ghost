<p>Combining tradition with progress is a difficult balancing act, with brand-loyal followers expecting more of the same, while the marque needs to promote innovation to compete with rivals. This was Ford’s situation in the 1950s with wood-bodied station wagons. The Ford Ranch became the blue oval’s first all-steel wagon.</p>
<p>This 1959 Ford Ranch Wagon is the model’s second incarnation and initially aimed to inject a bit of style into this practical segment. <a href="https://www.showdownauto.com/vehicles/479/1959-ford-ranch-wagon?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="noopener">Showdown Auto</a> are offering this incredibly original Ranch Wagon that really is an automotive snapshot in time.</p>

<p>Finished in its original two-tone paint from the late 1950s, the large station wagon sports much of the design flair found in that era. Fins, large round taillights, wraparound windshield, and a healthy smattering of chrome presents a vehicle that has separated itself from tradition and embraced the culture of its day.</p>

<p>However stylish, this is still ultimately a wagon, and so practicality is of high importance. An enormous trunk delivers huge cargo capacity, while occupants are treated to a cavernous cabin. This example’s interior is in excellent condition and features various shades that compliment the exterior. An intriguing landmark of the dashboard is its wonderfully Artdeco speedometer.</p>
<p>Under the hood of this Ranch is a 292 Ci V8 engine — an optional motor when ordered. In tandem with its automatic transmission, this car has only covered 12,000 miles from new! The one owner beauty has received a new carburetor, however the original will also be supplied. A new set of brakes, tires, and a gas tank are the only changes it has seen since 1959, making this an authentic time capsule car.</p>

<p>Never driven in the winter and kept in a garage, this incredible Ford appears to be museum quality in its preservation. It even has its original floor mats and a set of fender skirts still boxed. $22,900 is the asking price for this immaculate machine.</p>
