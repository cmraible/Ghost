<h3 id="this-no-reserve-auction-could-show-the-true-resale-market-for-the-all-new-c8-corvette">This no reserve auction could show the true resale market for the all-new C8 Corvette.</h3>
<p>With production rolling, the 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet/Corvette">Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a> will start heading to dealerships later this month, and we'll finally get to see what prices people are willing to pay in order to be one of the first in their neighborhood driving the first-ever mid-engine 'Vette. There are sure to be dealer markups and even customer markups – like this person <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/c8-corvette-resold-for-120000">trying to sell a Z51 for $120,000</a> – but <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Premier+Auction+Group">Premier Auction Group</a> will be auctioning off a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/188449/2020-chevrolet-corvette-c8-2lt-coupe">2020 Corvette 2LT</a> at no reserve that could very well set the watermark for this car's resale pricing. Up until now, the only other known <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/who-2020-chevy-corvette-c8">C8 Corvette sold at auction</a> was the $3 million Rick Hendrick paid for the first production car, VIN 001.</p>

<p>Based on the auction listing, the only details known about this Corvette is that it's the 2LT trim level painted in Ceramic Matrix Gray Metallic with Carbon Flash aluminum wheels and black brake calipers. The listing shows a single picture from the Corvette configurator with red brake calipers and what appears to be the Z51 Performance Package, so we're thinking that the actual car will look more like what you see here. <em>*This isn't an actual picture of the Corvette up for auction. It's a gallery of images from the Chevrolet configurator using information provided by the listing.</em></p>
<p>If that's the case, the 2LT starts at $66,200, and this specific configuration looks to price out at around $68,000, which is an absolute steal for a mid-engine sports car with this level of performance. The no-reserve aspect of this auction is what has us the most intrigued as it will show how much someone is willing to spend on the car without any high-pressure dealership tactic or feel-good charity auction to drive the price up.</p>
