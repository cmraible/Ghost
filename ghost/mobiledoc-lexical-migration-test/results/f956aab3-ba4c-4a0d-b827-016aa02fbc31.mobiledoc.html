The interview by the House Oversight and Reform Committee will likely precede what stands to be a blockbuster hearing with Exxon CEO Darren Woods and other executives of major oil and gas producers.”</em></p>

Tina Smith, D-Minn., said that a clean electricity standard will be part of the budget reconciliation package, which is likely to require utility companies to produce 80 percent clean electricity by 2030. Such a policy </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/11/biden-administration-clean-energy-climate-crisis"><em>would save hundreds of thousands</em></a><em> of lives in the United States over the next few decades by mitigating climate change and reducing air pollution.</em></p>

Nearly one quarter of families said they ‘mostly’ used their checks to increase their spending, and many other families spent some portion of their checks. Taken together, more than half of the $400 billion disbursed was spent within a few months of receipt. Families who did not use this assistance to increase their spending instead used it mostly to pay down debt (45%) or increase their savings (31%).”</em></p>
