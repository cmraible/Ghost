Many Brits walk out their front door in the morning only to find some bloke pinched their ride the night before. While Dodge muscle cars and Kias are popular targets here, in the UK it seems criminals really like to swipe Ford Fiestas."

Per government data from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Rivervale Leasing came to the conclusion the Ford Fiesta is the number one stolen car in the country."
