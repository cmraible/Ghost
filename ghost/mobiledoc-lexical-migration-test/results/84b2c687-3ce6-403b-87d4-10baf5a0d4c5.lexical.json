The reasoning behind this was that GM was pretty unprepared for how popular the cars would’ve been in 1953 and as such made quite a few little mishaps along the way which are easily recognizable and make the car stand out as unique with every vehicle. All of these things combine to give pretty good evidence that this may be the first Corvette Chevrolet ever produced.",
