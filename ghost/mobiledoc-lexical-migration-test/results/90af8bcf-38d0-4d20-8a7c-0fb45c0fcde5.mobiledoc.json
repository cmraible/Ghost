          " was one of those rare sequels which far surpassed its predecessor in every way. A key element which quickly establish the Bad to the Bone persona of the T-800 played by Arnold Schwarzenegger was the 1991 Harley-Davidson Fat Boy he acquires. The bike was used heavily in the promotion of the film and plays a pivotal role, particularly in the iconic chase scene in The Los Angeles River. For that reason alone, it’s easily one of the most beloved movie motorcycles of all time."

          "Plenty of people have fantasized about riding the bike, especially once they saw it make that dramatic jump, sparks shooting out as metal met cement. Of course, that was all movie magic, but it’s still cool to dream about. The black Fat Boy with red pinstriping plus a chrome fork and trim made it appropriately sinister. Nobody can forget the shotgun holster, allowing Arnie to whip out his 12-gauge during that iconic chase scene."

          ". One of the hero bikes which was actually ridden by Arnie was sold at auction back in 2018. It far exceeded the auction house’s upper estimate of $300,000 with the high bid reaching $480,000. Unlike some movie vehicles, the bike was still functional and in relatively good condition. Still, many were blindsided by the enthusiastic reception it received while on the auction block. After all, almost half a million dollars is a lot to fork out for a Fat Boy. We don’t know who the lucky bidder was or when the famous Harley will make another public appearance."

Perhaps the other three will resurface one day, but for now we don’t know if they’ve even been preserved. It would be surprising if they were scrapped."

While the Harley certainly is heavy and wide, some think the name is a tribute to the two A-bombs dropped on Japan during WWII – Fat Man and Little Boy. Others think that’s a real stretch, and I tend to agree with them, but people will read into almost anything."
