<p>It wasn't that long ago that Ford unveiled the revived 2021 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/380264/ford-bronco-heritage/">Ford Bronco</a> to the public. Before we could even get a glimpse of our first specimen in the wild, it looks the off-road Ford is already popping up in different situations. Here, the new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/restored-1969-bronco/">Bronco</a> is witness to the ultimate profession of love - a marriage proposal.</p>

<p>Three years ago, Daniel Kubistec and his fiancée Taylor McQueen met in Colorado and became a couple. This summer, the two were spending some time with family up in Michigan. When it comes to the American automotive enthusiast, Michigan is home to the "Motor City" aka Detroit. This is where Daniel saw the golden opportunity to pop the question to Taylor, who has been crushing on the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/380598/jay-lenos-68-bronco/">Ford Bronco</a> for a long time.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/08/bronco-proposal-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" bronco-proposal.jpg" alt="A marriage proposal in front of the new Bronco">" loading="lazy" width="932" height="524" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/bronco-proposal-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/08/bronco-proposal-1.jpg 932w"></figure>
<p>As fate would have it, her fiancée Daniel has an uncle, George Goddu, who is an electric vehicle strategist for the Blue Oval. Having planned the proposal in advance, Daniel locked in a a private tour with six people people from Ford of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/vintage-michigan-license-plates/">Michigan</a> Central Station where the new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-big-body-bronco-is-your-favorite/">Bronco</a> prototype currently resides. Taylor, who was completely hyped about the Bronco reveal, had no idea what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Daniel was able to propose marriage to his love in front of the all-new 2021 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/398794/1970-baja-bronco-tribute/">Bronco</a> to Taylor's ultimate surprise. So, congrats to this new Ford-loving couple, and maybe the new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/immaculate-1973-bronco/">Bronco</a> will have an invitation to the ceremonial festivities at a later date.</p>
