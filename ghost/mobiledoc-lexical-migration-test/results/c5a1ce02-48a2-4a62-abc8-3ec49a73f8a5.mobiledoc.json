Wells Bridge in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida. Apparently, the bridge is quite the popular spot for street racing. While that seems like a bad idea, it’s even worse when an unmarked cop car is right behind you, which was exactly what happened here."

At least we think they floored it. We’re really hoping the Mustang has an EcoBoost and the Audi really is an A4, because we’ve seen some Honda Civic races which are more exhilarating."

The race ended when at least one of those cars slammed into a family driving in their pickup truck. Thankfully nobody was killed, but both drivers and the family were injured."
