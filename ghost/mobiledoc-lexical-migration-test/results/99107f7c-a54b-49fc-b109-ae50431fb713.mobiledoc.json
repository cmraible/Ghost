After Ghostface breaks into Sidney Prescott’s house, Tatum drives her friend to the safety of her house in the Beetle, but not before reporter Gale Weathers aggressively taps on the window and demands to know all the gory details of what happened."

Many other Jeeps like this one served as law enforcement vehicles in countless communities across the United States in the 80s and 90s, so it’s really a slice of Americana gone by."

In her attempt to escape the carnage, Gale drives with her cameraman’s body hanging off the roof and over the windshield, almost runs down Sidney, then crashes into a tree. In a testament to how solidly those things were built, she’s able to walk away from the wreck."

That means the sedan has a cage between the rear and front seats, plus the back doors don’t open from inside – a key part in the scene after Ghostface gets the drop on the detectives, jumps into the driver’s seat, and takes off with one of them on the car. After the Chevy crashes, the police car is the setting for one of the most anxiety-inducing scenes in the movie as the girls have to crawl across the seemingly unconscious killer to get away."
