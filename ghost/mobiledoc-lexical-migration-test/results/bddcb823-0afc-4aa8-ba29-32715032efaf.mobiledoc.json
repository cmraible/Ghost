At the start of each level, you can see which jars are guaranteed to contain an ally/item and which jars contain enemies and yet, there will be others that will be random, resulting in the player to be cautious and time each jars opening with care. Upon failing and retrying a level, layouts mostly remain the same but with subtle changes here and there, such as a certain jar being on a different level or a randomised jar containing a different ally. This keeps the player on their toes and forces them to adapt to different situations."

It does well to stand out amongst the crowd within the genre with its Tim Burton-esque art style and the occassional cutscene provides some much appreciated personality. It's a bit of a shame that the game didn't translate as well as it could have from PC to console but regardless, it's still a reliable pick if you're in the mood for a good romp in the tower defence genre."
