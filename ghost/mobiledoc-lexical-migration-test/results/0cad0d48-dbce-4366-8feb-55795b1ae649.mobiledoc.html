<p>Cars from the '80s are starting to skyrocket in terms of collectibility, and this <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10772&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA</a> is a perfect example of a true investment-grade collector car. If you think this Trans Am looks brand new, it's because despite being a 32-year-old car, it survives with just 3,000 miles showing on the odometer, and it will be up for auction at the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/default.aspx?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2020 Fall Carlisle</a> Collector Car Auction at the Carlisle Expo Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>No matter where you look on this 1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA, it's like taking a time machine back to a Pontiac dealership circa 1988. The red paint job with gold snowflake wheels show exceptionally well, and there is no sign of damage or wear to the lower body kit. Inside, the saddle tan cloth interior is equally flawless, and this car is equipped with the premium stereo system with the steering wheel controls.</p>
<p>As the high-performance offering of the Trans Am lineup, the GTA model features a 5.7-liter TPI V8 under the hood. This L98 engine is tuned to produced 225 horsepower, and it's matched with an automatic transmission. Having been fully serviced and wearing recently replaced tires, this 1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA is ready to hit the road. Of course, with such low mileage, this survivor probably won't be traveling too far without a trailer.</p>
