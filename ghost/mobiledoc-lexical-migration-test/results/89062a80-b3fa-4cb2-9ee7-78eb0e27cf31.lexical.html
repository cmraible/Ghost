<p>Even from the very beginning, Apple has shown interest in the automotive world. The company that went public in 1980 to instant financial success, was Dick Barbour <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/racing/">Racing's</a> main sponsor in 1980. That season Bob Garretson, Bobby Rahal, and Allan Moffat finished second at Riverside and Sears Point, third at Road America, and a respectable seventh at Sebring in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-brings-modern-cabin-tech-to-classic-911/">a Porsche</a> 935K3 that proudly wore Apples rainbow logo. </p>

<p>The car's 750-horsepower and top speed of over 200 mph not only made it a worthy competitor on the track but also a front-runner among fans. Despite many DNFs and an early retirement at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-mini-movie-about-the-1955-le-mans/">24 hours of Le Mans</a> in its one and only season in the bright Apple livery, the rainbow 935K3 shared its single season sponsors knack for drawing an incredible level of brand loyalty. Auctioned by Gooding & Co. during the 2016 car week at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/70th-pebble-beach-concours-postponed-covid-19/">Pebble Beach</a>, celebrity and car collector Adam Corolla purchased the retired race car for $4.4 million and returned the car to the track where it belongs.</p>

<p>While the original 1979 Porsche 935 will probably not be up for sale anytime soon and when it is will be worth an estimated $10 million, a replica done in the Apple sponsorship livery is currently being offered by the Atlantis Motor Group for a much more affordable price. </p>
<p>With its 3.8 twin turbo engine built by Bob Holcomb putting out more than 700-hp, its estimated top speed is well over 200 mph. The replica also features quite a few other GT2 components including a GT2 6-speed transmission and a double wish-bone 993 rear suspension module. While the price tag is still a bit steep for the average Joe, $499,000 is not a bad asking price for a car claimed to be capable of being competitive at the Daytona Classic 24.</p>
