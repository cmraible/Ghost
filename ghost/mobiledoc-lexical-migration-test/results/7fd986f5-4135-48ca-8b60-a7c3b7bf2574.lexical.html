<p>Good things are happening! For starters, we’ve got some really incredible climate news, including a groundbreaking discovery about planetary resilience. We also have exciting labor developments, like a new deal reached between management and striking grocery store workers in Colorado. Finally, it appears that we Americans are smarter than we look, based on a new poll suggesting people realize corporate monopolies are contributing to inflation.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="good-news-for-climate-warriors">Good News For Climate Warriors!</h3>
<p>This week, it was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/new-coral-reef-1.6321308">announced</a> that scientists have discovered a new coral reef, undamaged by climate change, in the Pacific Ocean. The reef, which is deeper than most, is one of the largest in the world and suggests there could be more undiscovered reefs. This is huge news, considering that coral reefs are some of the <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_corals/coral07_importance.html">most diverse ecosystems in the world</a> — essential to our planet’s biosphere — and are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-change-is-killing-worlds-coral-reefs-oceans-warm-study-2021-10-05/#:~:text=Corals%20face%20an%20%22existential%20crisis,to%20human%2Dcaused%20climate%20change.">facing an existential threat</a> from climate change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, a paper with a <a href="https://www.bostonglobemedia.com/bostonglobe#:~:text=The%20Boston%20Globe%20Daily%20Audience,with%20a%20high%20net%20worth.">daily readership</a> of more than 500,000, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/20/science/into-red-how-globe-will-cover-climate-change/?event=event25">announced</a> that it is rethinking its climate coverage to better convey the seriousness of the crisis facing humanity. <em>The Globe</em> has created a new climate team “to incorporate the implications of a changing climate and the urgency of addressing it across our newsroom.” The paper says it will no longer debate climate science as it is settled. It also pledged to focus on climate justice, committing to holding private interests and elected leaders responsible for their role in the crisis.</p>
<p>That’s not all: Scientists have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/01/19/pr-firms-fossil-fuels-climate/">launched</a> a public pressure campaign against advertising companies doing business with fossil fuel giants. On Wednesday, more than 450 scientists published an <a href="https://cleancreatives.org/scientists">open letter</a> to advertising agencies to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/01/19/pr-firms-fossil-fuels-climate/">get them to abandon fossil fuel clients</a>.</p>

<p>Also, Citigroup, one of America’s biggest banks, is <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2022/01/citigroup-surpasses-peers-absolute-emissions-reduction-target-for-energy">stepping out ahead of its peers</a> with a new plan to reach its 2030 net-zero pledge through reductions in absolute financed emissions, rather than through mere emission intensity targets. Absolute emissions refer to the total amount of emissions, while intensity targets are relative to economic output.</p>
<p>Finally, states are <a href="https://grist.org/energy/abandoned-oil-wells-cleanup-infrastructure-law/">beginning</a> to plug abandoned oil and gas wells now that the federal government is offering them cash to do so. For years, these wells have been undercounted, creating environmental hazards, so the new effort to clean them up is a positive. Huzzah!</p>
<h3 id="labor-on-the-rise">Labor On The Rise</h3>
<p>Hundreds of truckers who work for the logistics company XPO Logistics Inc. are now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/l-a-port-truckers-seek-to-unionize-in-new-gig-work-showdown">trying to unionize</a>. The Teamsters union has filed with the National Labor Relations Board requesting a union election. Under President Biden, the NLRB has taken a <a href="https://www.venable.com/insights/publications/2021/09/the-pro-labor-shift-has-arrived-nlrb-general">pro-labor turn</a>, which could spell good news for the truckers.</p>
<p>Another positive development is that United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/king-soopers-strike-ending-update-13276446">announced</a> a tentative agreement to end its strike against Colorado’s largest grocery chain, King Soopers, which is owned by Krogers. The details of that agreement have yet to be made public, but the King Soopers president said that it will result in more money in paychecks and secured pension and health care plans.</p>
<h3 id="students-stand-up">Students Stand Up</h3>
<p>Across the country, young people are walking out of their schools or staying home to demand COVID-19 safety protocols. Last week, public school students in <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/11/nyc-students-walk-out-of-class-to-protest-covid-conditions/">New York City</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdaqw/students-are-doing-what-adults-wont-in-the-fight-against-omicron">Chicago</a>, and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/14/metro/boston-students-walk-out-this-morning-calling-remote-learning-stronger-covid-19-safety-measures/">Boston</a> walked out. The boycotts continued this week with students in <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/video/1025788">Montgomery County</a>, Maryland, <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/denver-students-plan-walkout-over-covid-demands/">Denver</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/18/school-strikes-covid-safety-omicron-oakland">Oakland</a> making public demands for improved school safety. The debate over school reopenings has been raging for months, and students have often been left out of the conversation.</p>

<h3 id="no-appetite-for-austerity">No Appetite For Austerity</h3>
<p>More than half of voters are siding with President Biden in his diagnosis of what is behind inflation: large companies with little competition. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/19/inflation-companies-polling/">new Morning Consult poll</a> indicates that 54 percent of voters, including 47 percent of Republicans, hold large companies responsible for inflation. Republicans and conservative groups like the Charles Koch network’s <a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/thanksgiving-inflation-build-back-better/">Americans For Prosperity</a> have tried to blame runaway government spending in order to push austerity.</p>
