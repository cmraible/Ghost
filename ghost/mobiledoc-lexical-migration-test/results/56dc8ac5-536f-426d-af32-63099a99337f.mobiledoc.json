          " is powered by a potent 3.6-liter M64 flat-six engine, becoming an iconic powerhouse within the German automotive enthusiast community. While the power of this legendary block is quite evident, the engine was rated at a genuinely impressive 282 horsepower and 250 ft/lbs of torque from the factory. All of that power is transferred through a four-speed Tiptronic automatic transaxle, which is desirable for this model. The gearbox allows for quick acceleration and bountiful power transfer and lets you enjoy some low-speed cruising. "

          " is the exterior featured in excellent condition with this sports car. It's almost unbelievable that this car is well over 20 years old. Even the interior, which you might imagine would be in rough shape, has been kept free of cracking, significant leatherwear, and carpet staining. Generally, this is a unique sports car regardless of its name, but when you consider it is one of the most desirable performance vehicles in the world, it's that much better. That's why you should consider purchasing this 1997 Porsche 911."
