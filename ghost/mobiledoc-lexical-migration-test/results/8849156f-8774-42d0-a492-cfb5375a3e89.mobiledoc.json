The MB had recessed  headlights and nine-slot grilles while the CJ-2A had larger headlights  flush-mounted in a seven-slot grille. In place of the MB's T-84  transmission, the CJ-2A was equipped with the beefier T-90 three-speed  transmission. The CJ-2A was still powered by the reliable L-134 Go-Devil  engine."
