<hr>
<p>Usually, when Hoonigan does its This Vs That series, it takes two cars which seem at least somewhat evenly matched, or at least it’s not a completely lopsided competition. So it seems odd that for the episode included with this article there’s a Time Attack 2008 Chevy Corvette Z06 versus a 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R. Yes, one is a heavily-modified race car and the other is a slightly modified street car, so it doesn’t really feel like a fair race.</p>

<p>When you look at these two on paper, everything is even more lopsided.</p>

<p>Time Attack cars can look really aggressive and this C6 Z06 is certainly no exception. That huge front splitter, massive rear wing, vented hood, front fender ports, and side-exit exhaust right behind the front wheels is enough to intimidate. On top of that, this thing has a 427ci LS7 V8 pushing 900-horsepower (on low boost or 1200-hp on high boost) and a 6-speed sequential transmission backing that up. With a curb weight of just 2,950 lbs. this would be a tough car to beat in any race.</p>

<p>The R32 Godzilla on the other hand has been modified so it’s making 600-hp using a built RB26 and a single turbo. A 5-speed transmission and the 3,153 lb. curb weight put it at a disadvantage as well. On paper, the only thing going for this Nissan is the all-wheel-drive system, which can help a car hook up in a hurry.</p>
<p>However, races aren’t determined by just what’s on paper, otherwise there would be no reason to actually run a race. In this case, the wild card is the fact Time Attack cars aren’t set up for drag racing but instead are built for getting around a road course quickly. All that aero might be a disadvantage to flat-out, straight-line acceleration. Or it might not. You’ll just have to watch the video to see what happens.</p>
<p>If you want to skip straight to the racing, go to 8:43 in the video.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVGzcowmXC8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
