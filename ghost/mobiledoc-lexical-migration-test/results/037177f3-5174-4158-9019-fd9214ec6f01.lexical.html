<p>We love <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">classic trucks</a> here on Motorious, but we usually stick to the light-duty stuff like pickups and open-top 4x4s. Today, we're going to indulge our inner child and look at a truck than can finally compete with the Tonka toys of our youth.</p>
<p>We found <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this restomodded 1967 Chevrolet C-50</a> for sale at <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/consignment">Streetside Classics</a> in Tampa, Florida. We're almost 100% certain that you won't ever have to worry about seeing another one at your local cruise night.</p>

<p>The orange and black motif reminds us of some of the limited edition Harley-Davidson pickup trucks we've seen offered over the years. However, this is <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a one-of-a-kind creation</a>.</p>
<p>It's powered by a 6.2 liter Detroit Diesel attached to a five speed manual transmission. We're sure that this thing is <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">a lot of fun to drive</a> – just in a different way than, say, a big-block Corvette.</p>

<p>In addition to the more modern drivetrain, there are a few other tweaks that stand to make <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this big truck</a> much more comfortable to drive. The restoration included air conditioning and four wheel disc brakes.</p>
<p>The truck rolls on a set of enormous 22.5" Alcoa wheels. These are the sort of wheels you might find on a big rig, and surprisingly, they don't look oversized in <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this application</a>. It's a testament to how massive this truck truly is.</p>

<p>We're not sure what <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this truck</a> did in a previous life, so we aren't sure exactly what used to ride behind the cab. Now, though, you'll find a modified Chevrolet C10 bed, with flares grafted on to accommodate those massive Alcoa wheels.</p>
<p>If this big, bad diesel truck is just what you've been looking for, <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2462-tpa/1967-chevrolet-c-50-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">it can be yours</a> for just $34,995. Just tell 'em that Motorious sent you.</p>
