<p>Minis are one of the most customised cars ever made, from coach builders that continue to take the 60-year-old car to new heights even in 2019 to those totally unique home builds, there are no two Minis alike.</p>
<p>The car featured here by <a href="https://www.thebarnmiami.com/vehicles/218/1973-austin-mini">The Barn Miami </a>is what looks to be a replica of the Paul Smith Mini. In the 1990s, there were a plethora of special edition Minis that all led up to the final incarnation (the Cooper Sport 500) before its eventual demise in 2001.</p>

<p>Paul Smith Minis were produced in 1999 and born from the 84-striped, 24-colored prototypes that appeared at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1997. Customer feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and a total of 2100 Paul Smith Mini’s were produced worldwide, albeit in single colors, sadly.</p>
<p>Being a striped offering, this car is sadly a replica, also proven by its 1973 manufacture year. That said, it comes in a fully authentic paint job like the original show cars, and sports some rather attractive deep dish alloys for some added flair.</p>

<p>Look inside and no stone has been left unturned. With fully customised leather seats and door cards adding to the cars awesome design.</p>
<p>Authenticity was clearly a priority to the original builder, with Paul Smith stickers in the rear windows along with what can only be assumed to be a replica Paul Smith bonnet badge, as the originals were made of 24-carat gold.</p>
<p>Being an earlier car, the Mini is running a single SU carburettor on the bulletproof A-Series motor. The '90s Minis tried to get up to date, and the resulting SPI and MPI vehicles are known to be troublesome with their electric fuel injected setup.</p>
<p>Although unconfirmed, we would assume that the UK registration plate – along with it being right-hand drive – proves its origins from the British Isles to add even more garnish to its already cheeky charm.</p>
