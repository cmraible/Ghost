With the might of a  thousand Italian thunderstorms, this car was quickly turned from a corner-carving track monster to an offroad beast. ",

Rather than showing off its various vehicular abilities on the autocross track on some drag strip, this raging bull barrels through the dirt at ridiculous speeds to show the pretty boys of the show truck industry how it's done. Of course, this is done via the use of a variety of modifications including a set of gigantic wheels and offroading tires, a plethora of engine upgrades, and some suspension work which gives the car a hell of a lot more ride height over its stock counterparts.

This is further driven home by the fact that the driver is extremely experienced and capable of using the car exactly how it should be wielded. However, no good build would be complete without a track day to test and showcase the car’s ability. This proved to be quite necessary for the car as the team would later find out that they need a lot more ride height and a skid plate once they hit the whoops. The car did pretty well with the jumps however it would appear that the car’s high power and awesome acceleration is going to be a bit of a challenge with the larger jumps. Overall, this car has a lot more boogying to do before it can officially hit the track but we hope to follow it closely on its journey to superstardom. ",
