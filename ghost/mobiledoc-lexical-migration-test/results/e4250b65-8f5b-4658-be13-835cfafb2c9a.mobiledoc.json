Sometimes thieves just take vehicles for some joyriding or to go steal yet other cars. But sometimes they dump a ride after it runs out of gas or is seriously damaged from driving it too hard. Maybe in this case they finally realized taking a cop car was a dumb move."

Kill switches, alarms, parking in a locked garage, and trunk monkeys are all good preventative measures. As for trackers, don’t just rely on the factory GPS system, although turning that on is still wise."
