<hr>
<p>This drag race between a heavily modified <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/nissan-r32-skyline-r35-gt-r/">Nissan R35 GT-R</a>, which rightfully is called Godzilla, and a heavily modified C6 Corvette is one of the most exciting <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hoonicorn-races-mclaren-senna/">This Vs That episodes</a> we’ve ever seen. After all, both cars are amazing in their own rite, demonstrating what’s possible when you take an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/juggernaut-worlds-quickest-viper/">impressive platform and apply the right modifications</a> for getting down the track quicker. The problem here is there can only be one winner in this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevelle-races-nissan-skyline/">import vs domestic smackdown</a>.</p>

<p>While it certainly has its critics, the R35 Nissan GT-R has more than proven itself on the track as a lethal weapon. And like the legendary <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/paul-walkers-nissan-skyline-r34/">R34</a>, the newer version of Godzilla can be modified to tremendous heights, especially if you pour in a ton of resources. That’s exactly what’s happened with this 2009 Nissan GT-R. Thanks to a long, long list of modifications, the turbocharged V6 is pushing a mighty 2,000-horsepower. Of course, all the power in the world does you no good unless you can get it to all 4 wheels, but the 6-speed DCT seems to do a great job helping manage that. Plus, with all-wheel drive, Godzilla has an advantage to hooking up to get an early lead.</p>

<p>Before you think the 2005 Chevy Corvette Z51 is outgunned, realize it has some trick up its sleeves. The most obvious one is the turbocharger the size of a platter (it’s a 98 mm) mounted right up front, well above the hood line. Sitting behind that is a 427ci LSX V8, which we’re sure has all kinds of internal wizardry we can’t see. Thanks to all this, this C6 ‘Vette is putting out a thunderous 1,500-hp. The guy claims if they dial the boost up from 10 psi to 30 it would crank out more like 2,000-hp. Helping transfer all that power to the rear wheels is a 2-speed Powerglide.</p>

<p>One thing that might be a deciding factor in this race is weight. While the C6 Corvette tips the scales at an impressive 3,200 lbs., the R35 GT-R is a little porkier at 3,500 lbs. That’s an impressive figure considering the production cars is dangerously close to 4,000 lbs.</p>
