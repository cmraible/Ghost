<p>According to local news station <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/seized-and-crushed-dodge-charger/">WTVY</a>, private investigator William “Bill” Robison <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/andrew-tates-cars-seized/">had several cars seized</a> by police in Dothan, Alabama recently. A 2023 Cadillac Escalade, 2023 Audi Q8, 2023 Corvette Stingray, 2015 Jeep Wrangler, Can-Am Defender, 2 Yamaha WaveRunners, Ranger Z 519 with Mercury Pro X 225 engine, EZ Go golf cart, and 2018 Honda Rincon ATV were all seized <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/luxury-cars-seized/">through the power of the courts</a>.</p>

<p>Robison has been charged with five counts of Theft by Deception after authorities say he received thousands of dollars from clients but never did the private investigation work as agreed. Prosecutors say more alleged victims of the private investigator have come forward since he arrest.</p>
<p>While the report says Robison is alleged to have bilked people out of “thousands” of dollars without performing the work, the list of vehicles seized would auction for big money, easily tens of thousands put probably into the six digits with ease.</p>

<p>What’s more, the article mentions authorities found almost $50,000 in cash at the guy’s house. The judge also froze his bank accounts, which we assume had more than $50,000 in them. Either this is killing a fly with a bazooka or the total amount the guy is accused of swindling people out of is much higher than is being portrayed.</p>
<p>Apparently, Robison is petitioning the court to unfreeze enough money to pay his attorney. After all, people are supposed to be treated as innocent until proven guilty. We wonder what the attorney has to say about the property seizures.</p>
<p>We also know a lot of our readers, thanks to feedback, aren’t fans of asset seizures since that power has been abused in some jurisdictions. We don’t know if that’s the case here but want to know what everyone else thinks of this case.</p>
