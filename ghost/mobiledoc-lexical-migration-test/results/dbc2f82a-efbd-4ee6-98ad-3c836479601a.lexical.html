<p>Even non-car people seem to really love seeing classic cars cruising around town, something you understand clearly after riding around in one. That’s why it’s always sad to see something like what appears to be a 1930s Ford Coupe get damaged in a crash.</p>
<blockquote><em>See a crash that took out two classic cars at once <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/colorado-car-crash-obliterates/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The incident in question happened in Lakeville, Massachusetts on November 3 just before 8 pm. According to the Lakeview, MA Fire Department, this was a single vehicle crash, so it’s not like the car was spun out by some other reckless driver. We have no idea if there was any inclement weather or if an animal or pedestrian jumped out into the road since none of that is mentioned.</p>
<p>What the fire department did announce was that one person was in the car at the time of the crash. The driver was able to get out, however when the emergency call was made it was indicated the person was stuck inside. What’s more, the classic Ford Coupe caught fire, making the situation urgent. Thankfully fire crews responded in time, were able to put out the blaze. The driver was transported to a local hospital but no update about their condition was provided.</p>
<p>We also have no idea just how extensive the damage to the car was. In the photo, which was taken at night so the lighting isn’t ideal, it looks like the fire was located in the engine compartment. The rumble seat is folded out, but the engine shrouding was either taken off before or might have been damaged in the crash. Hopefully, the car is easily repairable, but we doubt it could be considered anywhere close to a total loss.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, we hope the driver makes a full recovery. Considering the person was able to get out of the car themselves, that’s a fairly good sign.</p>
