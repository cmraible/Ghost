          "Hand-built in Milan, Italy, the Touring Sciàdipersia pays homage to the rare 1959-65 Maserati 5000 GT, which was commissioned by the Shah of Persia; Sciàdipersia is Italian for Shah of Persia. According to Touring Superleggera, this car has a '70s-inspired design that is highlighted by the sloped front end, wraparound rear glass and bright accents on the C-pillars and taillights. This rebodied exterior is distinct to the Sciàdipersia, while the interior is a fancier version of the Maserati's factory cabin. Like the interior, the Touring Sciàdipersia retains the Maserati's factory drivetrain consisting of a 454-horsepower 4.7-liter V8 giving it Italian-bred performance to back up to Milan-sculpted looks."

Only 15 examples of the Sciàdipersia will come to the U.S., although it isn't clear if that is combined or 15 coupes and cabriolets each. Either way, these bespoke Italian beauties will be sold through exclusive dealers that have yet to be announced. Likewise, pricing for the U.S.-spec Sciàdipersia coupe and cabriolet haven't been revealed, but there's no doubt these cars will cost significantly more than the $134,000 Maserati GranTurismo and $151,000 Maserati GT Convertible it's based off of."
