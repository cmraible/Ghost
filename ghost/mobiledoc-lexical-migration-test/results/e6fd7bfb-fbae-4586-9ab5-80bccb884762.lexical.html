<p>In 1989, Mazda introduced the Miata, sparking a renaissance of traditional <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-pace-cars/">sports roadsters</a> that continues until this very day. Miata fans are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/rock-or-restore-updated-swb-911/">more rabid than ever</a>, and for good reason â€“ the Miata is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1998-dodge-viper-gt2-commemorative-edition/">terrific car</a>.</p>

<p>When the Miata concept was still fresh and exciting, however, many manufacturers wanted a piece of the pie, including Ford. That's when they did something wholly unusual.</p>
<p>Ford turned to their Australian division, and their Mazda 323-based Ford Capri. Hey, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right? The car would be sold here as the Mercury Capri, and for a short while in the 1990s, they were relatively commonplace on the roads here.</p>

<p>Of course, the Mercury Capri wasn't quite a direct competitor to the Miata. For one thing, it was front wheel drive, with a greater focus on comfort and luxury than pure sports car thrills. It even had a pair of jump seats in the rear for occasional passengers.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the Capri was slow, though. In fact, there was a turbocharged version, <a href="https://buffalo.craigslist.org/cto/d/buffalo-1994-mercury-capri-xr2-turbo/7217145465.html">dubbed the XR2</a>. The XR2 was powered by a turbocharged DOHC 1.6 liter Mazda four cylinder making a very respectable 132 horsepower and 136 lb/ft of torque.</p>

<p>That was about 15 horsepower more than the Miata, although this was more or less a wash as the Capri weighed roughly 250 pounds more than the sprightly Mazda. Still, the Capri stands as an interesting automotive footnote, one that's worth a second look in a world filled with more or less identical jellybean-shaped crossovers.</p>
<p>We found <a href="https://buffalo.craigslist.org/cto/d/buffalo-1994-mercury-capri-xr2-turbo/7217145465.html">this very clean, very purple example</a> for sale on Craigslist in Buffalo, New York for $5,500.It has just 66,000 miles and appears to be in terrific shape. If you want to own a Mercury Capri of this generation, you could do a whole lot worse than this one.</p>
