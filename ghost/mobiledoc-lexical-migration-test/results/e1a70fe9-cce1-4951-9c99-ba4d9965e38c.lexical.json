The Florida-based car rental company has been a staple of American travel for years but had fallen on some tough times in 2020 due to decreased traveling. Of course, you could make the case that this led to a lack of attention to detail, leading to the company's recently brought up errors. Whatever the case, a new CEO came on board to get the company back on track, and, according to Stephen M. Sherr, it may already be there.",

The people affected by the company's error deserve to be compensated fairly, so new organizations must keep this topic alive until the dust has settled and the people's suffering has been rectified.",
