<p>Good things are happening! Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is pushing back against the fossil fuel industry, following years of activist pressure. Federal agencies including the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are flexing their muscles to stand up to bad actors. And Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is finally taking some heat for blocking her own party’s agenda.</p>

South Carolina, Arizona, and Utah all have what are known as OSHA state plans. Federal OSHA oversees workplace safety around the country, but states are allowed to handle it on their own as long as they meet minimum federal requirements.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

JPay, a Florida-based company owned by the private equity firm Platinum Equity Partners, is a dominant provider of financial services to prisons, jails, and inmates. The company provides former inmates with debit cards as they leave prison. The cards typically contain money that was seized when the former inmates were locked up, earnings from prison labor, or state benefits designed to help them get back on their feet.”</em></p>

In a four-page order, Judge Lyle Frank called the rollout of the switch ‘irrational, and thus arbitrary and capricious’ — and ordered the city to maintain the retirees’ current health care plans.” The switch was backed by municipal union leadership, which had “become parties in managing austerity” rather than standing up for their members, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/are-new-yorks-unions-selling-out-retirees/">The Daily Poster<em> previously reported</em></a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>• California Democratic Party To Vote On Banning Fossil Fuel And Police Donations </strong>— <em>In response to internal pressure, the California Democratic Party’s executive board will vote on whether to stop taking <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFKw9sQp4xc1wwAvvh9EvC8nuTklAXdP1NdF066mtFs/edit"><em>donations from police and fossil fuel organizations</em></a>, as well as from these groups’ executives and lobbyists, at their meeting this Sunday.</em></p>
<p><strong>• Sinema Starts To Take Heat </strong>— <em>If you’ve been reading </em>The Daily Poster<em>, you know by now that corporate donors are getting their way with the Arizona senator, for whom a few million in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/insurers-fight-to-protect-their-medicare-advantage-honeypot/"><em>ad buys</em></a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-pharmas-reward/"><em>campaign contributions</em></a> seems to be enough to change her views on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-pick-the-one/"><em>lowering drug prices</em></a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/kyrsten-sinemas-tax-flip/"><em>taxing the rich</em></a> and corporations. The good news is she’s finally facing real pushback. Both <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/biden-town-hall-manchin-and-sinema-agenda-516685"><em>Biden</em></a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/577873-sanders-hits-sinema-for-opposing-reforms-on-drug-prices-corporate-taxes"><em>Sen.

And five veterans on her advisory council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/us/politics/sinema-veterans-resign.html"><em>resigned</em></a> on Thursday, saying Sinema is “answering to big donors rather than [her] own people.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><strong>• <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/17/john-deere-strike-labor-market/"><strong>Workers Take Advantage Of A Tight Labor Market</strong></a></strong>(The Intercept/ Labor Notes)<strong> — </strong><em>“This strike wave isn’t the 1940s, when 1 in 10 U.S. workers went on strike in the space of a year. But it isn’t the labor lull of the 2010s, either, when large strike activity in the private sector fell toward zero. Today, workers are increasingly militant — that is, unwilling to accept bad terms of employment — but they are not particularly organized. With union density at a historical nadir, the unions are playing an inspirational role, but they aren’t the only source of the action. What we’re seeing now is strike activity beginning to rise from a decadeslong trough as the ‘essential’ worker — a new category of worker born of the coronavirus pandemic — challenges the boss to make good on that designation.” Employers need to work harder to attract workers, and some are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-shortage-missing-workers-jobs-pay-raises-economy-11634224519?mod=article_inline"><em>raising pay</em></a> or <a href="https://time.com/6103798/workplace-drug-testing/"><em>getting rid of drug testing</em></a> (while many others just continue to whine).</em></p>
<p><strong>• <a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/keep-the-oil-in-the-soil-a-massive"><strong>Keep The Oil In The Soil!</strong></a></strong>(The Crucial Years) — <em>“The news from DC, headquarters of the world’s first or second largest economy, is vague and depressing; Joe Manchin continues to do Big Oil’s bidding. But the news from Sacramento, headquarters of the world’s fifth largest economy, is profoundly different. A few minutes ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that after many years of pushing from environmental justice advocates, the state was ready to dramatically restrict oil and gas drilling. Advocates had demanded setbacks of 2,500 feet from homes and schools; Newsom went them one better, setting a 3,200-foot limit.”</em></p>
<h3 id="reader-comment-of-the-week">Reader Comment Of The Week:</h3>
<p>“I have to say, <em>The Daily Poster</em> has been spot-on, but I’ve become a bit used to it, in that I’ve found myself skimming and reacting with ‘es, correct as usual.’ But today’s email has literally compelled me to read it start to finish. I’m rarely tuned in to corporate news, but when I am, I find myself wondering what is it about these people that just seems wrong, but I can’t quite put my finger on it. What I read from you all this morning cleared the fog.” </p>
