One obviously possibility is the car was stolen and ditched, but more likely is that it’s a used-up prop from Six Flags or some other theme park. If you look closely at the photos, in the background are some round boat-like vessels with seats like what you find on many rides."

The paint looks to be in good condition, the cockpit is also incredibly clean and nothing is obviously broken. Unlike a Batmobile found in the woods last year, this one is in such good shape it would probably sell in a hot minute if placed on the market, and for good money, even if it’s not running. The fact it’s just sitting in a field is pretty shameful."
