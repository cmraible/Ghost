<p>Recently, I purchased a 15-inch Late 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, but I was faced with a conundrum — what external drive should I use for my backups? I own a WD Passport Ultra, which has faithfully served me in the past for backups, but it isn’t a native USB-C drive. I mean, sure I could use my USB to USB-C dongle that I purchased from Apple for $19, but that found its home on the tail end of my Yeti microphone and honestly, I like it there. And while I do carry the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multi-Port adapter whenever I use the MacBook, the decision as to what external drive I would be using for backups hinged more on allowing myself to move forward into the dongle-free world of the future.</p>
<p>At the time of purchase, my options at the Apple Store were limited to USB-C external drives manufactured by LaCie or G-Drive. Both companies offer external drives that look sleek and are extremely slim and portable. I was also eyeing the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/t3.html" target="_blank">Samsung T3</a> but in the end I bought G-Technology’s just released 500GB SSD G-Drive that sports USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKQR2ZM/A/g-technology-500gb-g-drive-slim-ssd-usb-c-portable-drive?fnode=5f" target="_blank">retails for $172</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I go with the G-Drive? </strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-46186" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/12/g-drive-500-ssd-profile-300x300.jpeg" alt width="300" height="300" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/12/g-drive-500-ssd-profile-300x300.jpeg 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/12/g-drive-500-ssd-profile-150x150.jpeg 150w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/12/g-drive-500-ssd-profile.jpeg 572w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Well for starters the G-Drive is slightly cheaper than the 500GB Samsung T3, which retails for $199. And even though the T3 series by Samsung has a 6 ft drop proof enclosure and the drive is about the size of a credit card, it still can’t overcome the speed benefits of the G-Drive slim SSD. The G-Drive is optimized to take advantage of Apple’s use of Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port technology in the new MacBook Pro’s, providing users with a USB-C capability of 10/Gbps (USB 3.1 Gen 2), meanwhile the Samsung T3 is rated for 5/Gbps (USB 3.1 Gen 1)</p>
<p>In terms of real world usage, my G-Drive was able to do a fresh backup of 91GB of encrypted data in well under an hour. That’s fast. I never have had a drive this fast. I wanted to see what kind of sorcery was occurring, so I fired up Blackmagic Disk Speed Test.</p>
<p>My results were impressive. On average I was getting about 300MB/s for write speeds and about 520MB/s on read speeds.</p>

<p>Overall I am glad I chose the 500 GB G-Drive slim SSD and I highly recommend it.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
