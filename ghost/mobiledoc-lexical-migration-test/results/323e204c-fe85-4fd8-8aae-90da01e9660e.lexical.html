<p>It's one of those scary days on the web for journalists and publishers ‚Äî Google is rolling out a major new update. The Helpful Content update (I miss the days when Google gave major updates cutesy names like ‚ÄúPanda‚Äù or ‚ÄúHummingbird‚Äù) started rolling out this morning, and will take around two weeks to fully implement. </p>
<p>I've written some initial thoughts about <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2022/08/major-google-update-incoming-the-helpful-content-update-is-imminent/">how to cope</a>, and what to watch, and will write more about it when we know more about how it's impacting publishers. </p>
<p>Do bear in mind that we won't know its true impact for some weeks, because Google will be constantly tweaking it as it rolls it out. These sorts of updates always have some unexpected side-effects that the search giant will be trying to correct as quickly as possible. That might be why they've chosen to roll it out in what's the dog days of summer for many of us in the English-speaking world. By the time traffic picks up again in the autumn, they should have it sorted and working well.</p>

<p>In the meantime, be slightly sceptical of advice that's too detailed. Most people bashing out their hot takes are just guessing, and a guess written in an authoritative tone is still a guess. </p>

<h3 id="heres-the-tldr-of-the-helpful-content-update-for-you">Here's the tl;dr of the helpful content update for you:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you've been writing articles that are based on reader need, you'll be fine (eventually)</li>
    <li>If you've been targeting intents or keywords where there's no useful information to deliver yet (<em>What we know about the GoPro Hero 11</em>, for example: the answer is ‚Äúnothing yet‚Äù, bar a few guesses), then you might be hit, and need to watch your analytics closely.</li>
    <li>If you see an impact, but don't think you're guilty of that sort of SEO-first strategy, don't panic ‚Äî Google will be tweaking this update for some months to come, so expect some instability in your search traffic.</li>

<p>As I mentioned above, Google is rolling out a really big update from today. We won't know the true impact of it for some weeks, but you should be cautious. If the history of past updates teaches anything, it's that what Google <em>says</em> will happen isn't always what <em>actually</em> happens.</p>
<p>This piece from last week, just after the announcement, has some advice for you:</p>

<p>After a year of riding a PR wave, things are getting tough for newsletter platform Substack. It's had a burst of bad publicity, and is quietly closing down some of the schemes that earned it so much attention last year.</p>

<h3 id="the-lost-city-of-twitter">The lost city of Twitter</h3>
<p>Twitter's going through a rough time, between the Musk shitshow, and now the revelations about its potential security issues. But the deeper problem might be a slow exodus of communities to other spaces:</p>
<blockquote>Imagine that Twitter is a city whose corrupt government and potholed streets are pushing residents out. Slowly you‚Äôll start to see more ‚Äúfor rent‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôve moved‚Äù signs in shop windows. As city workers leave and budgets are slashed, the potholes will get worse.</blockquote>
<p>This is how social networks die. Twitter could recover, with the right leadership. But leadership has always been Twitter's problem.</p>

<h3 id="why-vox-is-winning-on-youtube">Why Vox is winning on YouTube</h3>
<p><em>Vox</em> is succeeding on YouTube, which has been for many a money pit into which too many publishers have shovelled money for very little return. This piece starts to dig into why.</p>
<p>There's still huge untapped potential for traditional publishers on YouTube ‚Äî but they need to stop doing ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù TV content, and start doing truly profession, YouTube native content. </p>

<p>Try to get access to it as an academic, and you'll be met with stony silence from Meta. The reason that happens is the same reason Facebook is slowly smothering the tool: it's far too revealing of what actually happens on Facebook. </p>

<h2 id="and-finally%E2%80%A6">And finally‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>If you were even mildly geeky and young in the 1980s, then you would have been deeply familiar with <em>Crash</em> and <em>ZZap!64</em>. They were part of the first wave of computer <em>gaming </em>mags<em>, </em>in a field largely dominated by more serious hobbyist mags. They were brash, swashbuckling, rude and huge fun.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/Crash18.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="588" height="840"></figure>
<p>I was a loyal reader of <em>Crash</em>, and it deeply shaped the way I think about publishing. At the heart of that was the artist Oli Frey, who created most of the covers, and a good chunk of the interior art. He passed away recently, and this is a lovely obituary of a man who was a genuine trailblazer in magazines.</p>
