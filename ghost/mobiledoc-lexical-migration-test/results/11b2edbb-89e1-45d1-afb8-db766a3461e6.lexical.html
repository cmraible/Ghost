<p>Friends:</p>
<p>If you are looking for a Mother’s Day gift, we’ve got a great one for you — one that your mom will love, that’s good for the planet, and that helps fund <em>The Lever’s</em> journalism.</p>
<p>You should use <a href="https://sheetsgiggles.com/lever">this special discount</a> for our subscribers and get your mom some of the famous cooling eucalyptus sheets from our friends at Sheets & Giggles. As you will see in the photo, we use them in my household — and they are terrific:</p>

<p>Sheets & Giggles was founded by one of <em>The Lever</em>’s first subscribers, Colin. He’s a longtime friend and progressive activist who I first got to know when he was leading the fight for major health care reforms here in Colorado. His company donates 1 percent of their profits, time, and products to local charity — <strong>and every sheet set you purchase through this special discount supports <em>The Lever</em>’s journalism.</strong></p>

<p>This is a win-win: When you get a sheet set with <a href="https://sheetsgiggles.com/lever">this special link</a>, you help us build our newsroom, and you can get your mom a great gift.</p>
<p>And when I say great, I really mean it: These sheets are naturally cooling and sustainably produced, requiring far less energy to produce than cotton sheets, a fraction of the water, and zero insecticides. They are also super soft. As I’ve often joked, they are softer than the Democratic Party, which means they are <em>really </em>soft.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled that Sheets & Giggles is supporting <em>The Lever</em>’s work and helping us build our newsroom that is holding power accountable. And I really appreciate them offering <a href="https://sheetsgiggles.com/lever">this big discount to our subscribers</a>. I hope you’ll use it.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
