<p>Motorious would like to thank <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com">FindingOldCars.com</a> for providing content on vehicles left in fields, barns, wrecking yards, swamps, and backyards that are a homage to days gone by. In some cases <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com">there is value</a> to the wreckage left in the boneyard for restoration, and then in other cases it's simply the artistic value of the photography. <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com">Finding Old Cars</a> is on a mission to give these cars a place in the modern world.</p>
