          "The FD generation of the Mazda RX-7 was sold in the U.S. from 1992 through 1995, and many were raced, abused and/or modified. This 1993 Mazda RX-7 is 100 percent original right down to the factory wheels, and it survives today with just over 21,000 actual miles. And best of all, this RX-7 comes in the best color combination you could get this car in with a Vintage Red exterior paint job complemented by a tan leather interior."

          "What made the RX-7 so entertaining was its light curb weight and its peppy rotary engine. These cars used a 1.3-liter two-rotor, twin-turbo rotary engine to produce 255 horsepower, which made for impressive acceleration capabilities from the sub-3,000-pound sports car. About the only thing this particular 1993 Mazda RX-7 has going against it is that it has an automatic transmission, but we're sure even the most hardcore enthusiasts will give this gorgeous, well-kept RX-7 a pass on that."
