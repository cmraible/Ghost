          "When it comes to the off-road, there is nothing quite like a mean machine that is more than capable of taking the road less traveled and look incredible doing it. GR Auto Gallery is offering the chance to snag one incredible 1985 Chevrolet Blazer with plenty of upgrades. This truck hailed from a private collector, and there's no doubt that plenty of time and money were spent building this incredible behemoth Blazer."

          "This retro Blazer shines like a diamond in gleaming black paint, and both the finish and body appear to be in perfect shape. Even more, this truck has a sturdy front bumper complete with a winch to ensure that nobody remains stuck in a rut for too long. This monstrous truck has been given plenty of upgrades inside and out."

          "Tucked inside the massive engine bay of the truck is a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine topped with a twin screw supercharger, so there is plenty of power on tap. Power is shifted to the ground via a stout TH400 automatic transmission. Kick this gargantuan Blazer into 4-wheel-drive for some off-road fun with no clearance woes thanks to a heavy-duty full suspension lift kit. Power disc brakes on all four corners allow for easy stopping, and power steering makes navigating those turns a breeze. Even the undercarriage looks brand new and displays purple touches that perfectly pop against its black exterior."

          "Behind the doors of this large truck is an immaculate interior in mostly black, but aesthetically pleasing purple accents break up the monotony. Also installed inside the truck are two-tone performance-inspired seats with bright purple harnesses. Power windows bring in fresh air with just the push of a button, and working heat warms up the cabin when temperatures are a bit chilly."
