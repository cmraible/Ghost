He faced charges for leaving the scene of a crash with a death, vehicular homicide, and racing on a highway. Panos’ attorney argued before a judge that since his car didn’t actually hit the Escalade charges should’ve been dismissed. Shockingly, that maneuver worked as Panos’ attorney argued that his client was actually racing the Camaro. We don’t have all the details of the courtroom proceedings, but that’s pretty interesting."
