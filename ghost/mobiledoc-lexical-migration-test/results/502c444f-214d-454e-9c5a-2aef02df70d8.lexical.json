Two C5-Rs (chassis 001 and 002) were built ahead of Daytona, and this saw success right out of the gate with chassis 001 scoring a second-place finish wearing the No. 3 and a black-and-silver GM Goodwrench livery. Corvette Racing participated in five races in the 1999 season, and chassis 001's worst finish was fifth place at Road Atlanta.",

In this livery wearing the No. 63, chassis 001 achieved its biggest accomplishment by racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June 2000 â€“ this marked the first Le Mans race for a factory-backed Corvette team. Le Mans also proved to be chassis 001's final race as this car was retired and sold to private auto museum. Chassis 001 and 002 were replaced by chassis 003 and 004, which offered better handling thanks to dimensions that were three inches wider. Only 11 C5-Rs ever built, and while the factory teams switched to the C6.R in 2005, the C5-R is still racing today.",
