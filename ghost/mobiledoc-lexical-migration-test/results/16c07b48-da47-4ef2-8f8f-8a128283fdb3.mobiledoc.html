<p>The Pokemon company have been quite vocal about their new games’ success, and the sales figures continue to impress. Coming directly from The Pokemon Company themselves via Twitter, the games have confirmed to have hit THREE MILLION units sold worldwide within its first three days of being on store shelves.</p>

<p>The tweet also doesn’t specify as to whether this includes digital sales but if we were to venture a guess, we’d suggest that it would.</p>
<p>Not only is this an impressive achievement on its own merit, but it is also confirmed to be the fastest selling Nintendo Switch game to date. But how long will that record last with <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> just on the horizon?</p>
