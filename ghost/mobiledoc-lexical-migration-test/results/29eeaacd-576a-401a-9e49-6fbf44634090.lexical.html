<hr>
<p>This year, the world has taken a drastic turn of events rather quickly due to this coronavirus that has most of us contained to our houses as we try not to let this modern day plague spread even further than it already has. Almost everything has been cancelled, and there's a world-wide shortage of toilet paper among other things. While many of us have to stay contained to our residences, companies are giving virtual tours so we don't lose our minds. One of those companies is <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Nissan">Nissan</a>, and they spent some time to give everyone a glimpse into their 400-car heritage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/how-covid-19-is-affecting-collector-car-auctions/">collection</a> in Japan. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://nissan-heritage-collection.com/">heritage collection</a>, widely known as the Zama Warehouse, has recently closed to outside visitors at this time thanks to the coronavirus. While everyone is quarantined and likely losing their minds, Nissan has decided to host a video tour of the vintage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1995-mitsubishi-3000-gt/">JDM</a> cars for those needing a fix.</p>
<p>A two-hour tour was hosted by a spokesperson for the automaker as well as a "company history officer", according to <a href="http://japanesenostalgiccar.com/">Japanese Nostalgic Car</a>. The tour featured all kinds of Nissan and <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Datsun">Datsun</a> automobiles with the age ranging all the way back to the 1930s to present day. With about 400 cars in the warehouse to check out, each one has its very own story and personal history, a tour that could take well over two hours if one were to delve into each one.</p>
