This well-maintained 1980 Datsun 280ZX 10th Anniversary Edition Coupe with just 43,000 actual miles up for bids through Premier Auction Group."

Only 3,000 of these 10th anniversary coupes were produced, and 2,500 of those were cloaked in black and gold while the other 500 cars were painted in red and black. This example is car number 53 out of 2,500."

Unique dash plates grace the dash of each car, but the number does not indicate the order of production since these were applied after groups of cars were already built. This special edition also has plenty more trunk space than its predecessor."
