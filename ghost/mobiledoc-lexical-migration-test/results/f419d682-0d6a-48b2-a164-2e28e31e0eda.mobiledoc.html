<p>Although the 2020 Dodge Challenger 50th Anniversary Commemorative Edition doesn't get the Limited Edition's shaker hood or numbered dash plaque, it does have a bold muscle car attitude. The most notable additions are the satin black accents on the hood and taillight lettering as well as the 20-inch "Gold School" wheels. Special 50th anniversary headlights add a nice little Easter egg to the design, while the "Challenger 50" logo is added to the grille, rear spoiler and instrument panel. The Commemorative Edition is offered in the following colors: Granite, Indigo Blue, Octane Red, Pitch Black, Triple Nickel, White Knuckle and the all-new Smoke Show hue, which is also available on the 2020 Dodge Charger.</p>
<p>Inside, the 50th Anniversary Commemorative Edition adds a few throwback cues like the white-faced instrument gauges, a 1970 Challenger displayed on the gauge cluster's startup screen and sepia accents throughout the cabin. There's also a modern theme to the interior, though, with Alcantara on the seats and door panels and real carbon fiber on the dash.</p>
<p>The 50th Anniversary Commemorative Edition will be available on the Challenger's R/T, R/T Scat Pack and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-dodge-charger-scat-pack-widebody-review/">R/T Scat Pack Widebody</a> trim levels with prices ranging from $4,995 for the standard R/T to $5,995 for the Scat Pack models.</p>
