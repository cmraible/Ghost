          "In addition to being able to control whether a single light is on or off as well as the brightness for each light, you can also customize each light's color manually. When viewing the lights in a particular room via the app, tap on the multi-color tear drop-shaped icon on top right of the app. This will bring up a color palette where you can manually adjust the color of each light. I've found this functionality to be more difficult to use than allowing the lights to automatically pull colors from a particular scene. The reason being because it's hard to precisely move the lights around the color palette, which can make it tricky to pin point the exact color you're looking for. It would be really cool if you could input a specific hex code–a feature I'd love to see added. "
