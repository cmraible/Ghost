Being developed for more standard high-powered consoles such as the PS4, there was some fear from fans that the performance of a Switch port would not be up to par. That could not be further from the truth: the optimisation of the game for the Switch is all but flawless. There are no moments of noticeable lag, frame rate drops, or struggle of the console throughout the game. In fact, the graphics hold up just as well as they do on the bigger consoles, with barely any noticeable drops in quality and a butter-smooth experience."
