<p>Once you fire up that amazing 5.2-liter supercharged cross-plane crank V8 engine, which sounds like nothing else, you’ll understand why so many people want to get their hands on this car. It belts out a solid 760-horsepower and 625 lb.-ft. of torque for plenty of tire-smoking fun. Through the dual-clutch transmission, gear changes come so quickly you might not even notice. If you plan on using <a href="https://shelbyamericancollection.tapkat.org/wina2020ShelbyGT500?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">this car</a> at the strip, launch control will help you achieve optimal quarter mile times.</p>
<p>The performance goodness doesn’t stop there. A MagneRide damping system keeps the ride quality comfortable and yet responds to steering inputs with incredible speed. Brembo brakes exceed anything used in a production Mustang before, bringing this ride to a dead stop like a true champion.</p>
