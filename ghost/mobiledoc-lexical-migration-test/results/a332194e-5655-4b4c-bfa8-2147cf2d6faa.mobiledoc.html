<p>We don't write about motorcycles very often <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/year-two-1954-chevrolet-corvette/">here on Motorious</a>. We're primarily <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1951-mercury-custom-coupe/">a car site</a>, and while <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/harley-davidson-pulls-out-india/">we love motorcycles</a>, there are other sites that cover bikes better than we ever could.</p>
<p>That means that on those rare occasions when we <em>do</em> write about motorcycles, you should pay attention, because it's bound to be something special. Take, for example, this customized Triumph Bonneville, inspired by none other than Steve McQueen.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/absolut-motorcrafts-triumph-bonneville-steve-mcqueen-edition-keeps-it-classy-149783.html#">Auto Evolution</a>, the bike seen here was built by the Spanish custom cycle shop Absolut Motorcraft. Founded by Federico Cerdá in Bercelona, the firm has a knack for making just about anything with wheels and an engine faster, prettier, and altogether cooler.</p>
<p>As a result, they were particularly well-equipped to build a bike inspired by the King of Cool himself. Triumph themselves actually produced a Steve McQueen edition of the Bonneville, but Absolut Motorcraft took it to the next level.</p>

<p>It's well known that McQueen liked off-road motorcycling. Scrambler-type bikes were popular in his day, and they've enjoyed a renaissance over these past few years. </p>
<p>Absolut Motorcraft took the roadgoing Bonneville and transformed it into a dual-purpose machine that would be equally at home on the dunes or parked in front of a dive bar.</p>

<p>Big, knobby tires, abbreviated fenders, and a custom exhaust are the most easily identifiable deviations from the stock bike. All of them combine to make for a bike that looks far more aggressive than it was in its previous iteration.</p>
<p>In true custom bike style, everything unnecessary was chopped down or removed altogether. The bike has a lean, purposeful look, much like McQueen himself. We think he would have liked this one.</p>
