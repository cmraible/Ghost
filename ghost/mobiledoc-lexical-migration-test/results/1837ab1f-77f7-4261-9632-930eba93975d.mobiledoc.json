Seriously, how many spoiled rich guys can use daddy’s money to abuse a supercar and just laugh it off to get millions of views? That’s why this Chevy C10 with six tires, and LSX and supercharger immediately got us excited. You don’t see something like this every day."

What’s even better is the suspension and chassis are rigid enough to allow for zero wheel hop under load, meaning this truck hooks up in a hurry."

At a time when it seems like so many media outlets diminish dads and the role they should be playing in their children’s lives, seeing these two work together to overcome all kinds of frustrating difficulties, achieving something so awesome is just great. That and we also realize the son probably started out holding the flashlight."
