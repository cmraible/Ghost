That’s what we have with this car fire authorities responded to in Fife, Washington in the early morning hours of July 13. It involved a stolen car, road rage, and a shooting."

The other driver decided to start tailgating the Bimmer as both cars began driving down the road. That’s when someone in the BMW pulled out a gun and started shooting at the other vehicle, which then rammed the Bimmer from behind."

Forensics can match spent rounds from a gun, too. Hopefully investigators are still able to figure out who was driving the other vehicle and track down the female passenger from the BMW. Obviously the driver should know who was riding with him, but that’s not a guarantee considering the kind of lifestyle he’s likely living."

While some are chopped up and sold for parts, others are shipped off overseas, the thieves sometimes sell them to other criminals so they can have some fun and/or use them to commit more crimes. In other words, car thefts fuel other violent crimes so they’re absolutely a big deal."
