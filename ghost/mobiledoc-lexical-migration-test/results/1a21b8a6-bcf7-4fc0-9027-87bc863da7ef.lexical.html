<p>Let’s get one thing straight, the Rambler Classic is called a classic for a reason. It was the name given to an intermediate-sized automobile that was built and sold by AMC (American Motors Corporation) from 1961 through 1966. Upon its initial introduction, the Rambler featured six-passenger four-door sedan and station wagon versions. And right here right now, you can get your hands on a 1963 AMC Rambler Wagon 770 Cross Country LS model.</p>
<p>Classic Car Liquidators is offering up this beautiful classic car in Sherman, Texas. This 1963 Rambler wagon features a stunning gold exterior that matches up well with the custom gold interior. It has 3.70 gears with a posi differential and a 2-link rear suspension with a panhard bar. The vehicle drives on a smooth RideTech air ride suspension with Ride Pro-X air ride controller. It is also equipped with Moser Engineering third members and axles for improved ride quality. Under the hood sits an aluminum radiator with an electric-powered fan.</p>

<p>This Cross Country beauty is powered by a 5.3-liter LS-swapped engine for impressive performance that is effectively stopped via the superior disc brakes. Power is sent to the wheels via a 4L60E automatic transmission with overdrive. This model features manual steering with manual brakes and a manual tailgate window. Out back, the wagon sports a dual exhaust and an aesthetically-pleasing roof rack to hold additional cargo.</p>

<p>The third-gen Rambler wagons incorporated a slew of engineering solutions and innovations. Among these was curved side glass and a “uniside” door surround made from single steel stamping techniques. This process replaced 52 separate parts, simultaneously reducing both weight and assembly costs. It also improved the structural rigidity of the vehicle and allowed for better door fitment overall. AMC’s smart engineering tactics earned it the <em>Motor Trend</em> Car Of The Year Award in 1963.</p>
