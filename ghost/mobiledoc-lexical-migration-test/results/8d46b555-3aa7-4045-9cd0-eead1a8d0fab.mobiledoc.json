That’s not surprising considering the guy and his famous Freedom Factory are in the Tampa Bay, Florida area right where the storm ripped through. Thankfully, nobody was hurt and it looks like Cleetus will get things up and running without many issues."

          "The first big casualty came from a pole barn Cleetus thought would be safe because it had zero walls for the wind to push on. In hindsight, the wind also pushes on structural supports and the roof itself, so the massive roof came down. While he moved one vehicle before the storm, trapped underneath was the Bald Regal, the rafters crushing its roof. Several other cars were also trapped inside, but honestly none were nearly as much of a loss."

In all honesty, the damage could’ve been so much worse. Thankfully, a ditch on the side of a road captured plenty of the water, so flooding didn’t seem to be much of an issue."

His family was also just fine and they didn’t even lose power, so count those blessings. After all, losing your house in a hurricane is a much bigger deal than a few so-so cars getting damaged, along with fences, signs, and a pole barn."
