          " is an amazing, special car people rightfully are excited to see and even more enthusiastic about owning. However, if you want to get one of the original models and not a continuation you better have some healthy financing, because they don’t go for cheap. Even more out of reach for your average shopper is this 1967 Shelby Cobra 427 CSX 3000 that’s seeking a new owner. Car CSX3281 not surprisingly has been owned by notable collectors and is extremely well-documented, which only increases its value."

It originally had a 428ci Police Interceptor big block V8 engine from the factory, but that later was replaced with a 427ci by former owner Rick Reese, who was a Cobra Performance employee, so the guy knew what he was doing. It also features a 6-speed manual transmission."

This Cobra rides on Sunburst knock-off wheels for a genuine presentation."
