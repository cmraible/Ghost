Apart from this LJ20 having plenty of sentimental value for the owner (more on that later) they genuinely don’t make them like they used to."

Being so small definitely has its advantages. For starters, just like the old Willys Jeeps used in WWII, it can fit through really tight spots. Also, it’s so lightweight it doesn’t sink into sand, mud, etc. like our portly trucks of today. Suzuki says it weighed just over 1,300 lbs. which is crazy. You’ll see during the recovery at one point these guys actually pick up and move the Jimny."

For those who do, the old guy is a favorite with his wry humor and can-do attitude, always saying “we’ll get ‘em out” even when a job is next to impossible."

The fact it was trapped by a landslide which buried the trail he used to get it to his plot of land in the mountains could be a good reason why. The terrain is especially rugged, especially since nobody has traversed it in any machine for decades. It’s not exactly what you would call ideal conditions, but these guys are highly experienced and crazy enough to try such a thing."

Still, it’s such a tight squeeze that the Jeep takes some damage, both going in and coming out. Since they’re getting ready to do some big modifications on the thing they’re not so concerned about the dents and scrapes, but it’s still cringe-inducing to watch."

          "One area of the makeshift trail is particularly technical, so these guys decide to float the Suzuki in the river and pull it upstream to where the trail isn’t so challenging. It’s not a bad idea, but I honestly thought they were going to build a raft, load the LJ20 on, then pull it along using a winch. Instead, they just pull the thing through the water using the winch, and it doesn’t go as well as they had hoped. I don’t want to spoil too much because the three videos, one of them checking out the area and planning, then two of them doing the actual recovery, are entertaining. Sure, it makes for a lot of watching, but what else are you going to do? This is far and away better than the slop on TV and streaming services these days, especially since none of this is scripted, so you get reality with all its blemishes."
