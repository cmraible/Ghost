<p>Earlier this week, BlackRock Inc. chief executive Larry Fink made headlines with the release of his <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter?cid=ppc:blk:ll:na:ol:goog:na:v2:bhv:tl&gclid=CjwKCAiA55mPBhBOEiwANmzoQr2upz1QMEO875DunkktiHQa5IL2OssZTsEqHn-EeS9aI9vRa9ZneRoCluMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">2022 annual letter</a> to CEOs. “Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world,” Fink wrote, asserting the weighty responsibility companies have to focus on their carbon footprint. “The question is, will you lead, or will you be led?”</p>
<p>While the CEO of the global asset management giant has proven adept at co-opting the language of environmental advocates, his greenwashing rhetoric may be running up against his real-world behavior.</p>

<p>“If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God’s children to have the basic necessities of life, she, too, will go to hell.” — Martin Luther King, Jr. in his speech <a href="https://www.beaconbroadside.com/broadside/2018/03/the-50th-anniversary-of-martin-luther-king-jrs-all-labor-has-dignity.html">“All Labor Has Dignity,”</a> which he delivered to striking sanitation workers on March 18, 1968 at Bishop Charles Mason Temple of the Church of God in Christ in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>On Monday, BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink released his latest <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter?cid=ppc:blk:ll:na:ol:goog:na:v2:bhv:tl&gclid=CjwKCAiA55mPBhBOEiwANmzoQr2upz1QMEO875DunkktiHQa5IL2OssZTsEqHn-EeS9aI9vRa9ZneRoCluMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">annual letter</a> to leaders of the companies that BlackRock — the world’s biggest asset management firm — is invested in. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients,” Fink <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/business/dealbook/larry-fink-blackrock-letter.html">wrote</a>, earning major coverage — including on the front page of the <em>New York Times</em> — arguing that reducing a company’s carbon footprint is a strategy to boost profits and long-term corporate resiliency.</p>
<p>While Fink’s calls to chief executives in recent years to adopt a greater environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/business/dealbook/blackrock-laurence-fink-letter.html">have reportedly shifted several businesses</a> toward the goal of becoming carbon-neutral or carbon-negative, the truth is that the Wall Street giant’s words don’t quite carry the same weight as its actions.</p>
<p>Just last month, <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/aramco-agrees-15-5-billion-gas-pipeline-deal-with-blackrock">reported</a>: “A group co-led by BlackRock Inc. will invest $15.5 billion in Saudi Arabia’s natural-gas pipelines as the kingdom opens up more to foreign companies and looks to fund a huge increase in fossil-fuel production.” This move aligns with Fink’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html">greenwashing</a> earlier this week, when he said that BlackRock avoids widespread divestment of holdings from the fossil fuel industry because there are oil and gas companies critical to achieving net-zero emissions. </p>
<p>Maybe Fink should have mentioned in his letter that investing in gas pipelines undoes any good done by brands moving toward carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>“BlackRock’s new deal with Saudi Aramco throws all of Fink’s climate rhetoric from the past 2 years into question,” <a href="https://blackrocksbigproblem.com/actions-speak-louder-than-words-blackrocks-attempt-to-greenwash-a-15-billion-pipeline-deal/">noted</a> environmental advocacy group BlackRock’s Big Problem in December. “It seems clear that the world’s largest asset manager is not yet on the pathway <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits">the </a>[International Energy Agency] and [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] have outlined for us to stay within somewhat manageable degrees of global warming.”</p>

<p>BlackRock’s Big Problem isn’t the only group of activists challenging Fink’s misleading rhetoric. Yesterday morning, New York Communities for Change took their message all the way to BlackRock’s headquarters: <a href="https://twitter.com/nychange/status/1483509923342426112">“Larry Says Don’t Look Up,”</a> a sign held by one protester said.</p>

<p>In 2020, CVS Health — which owns health insurer Aetna — <a href="https://cvshealth.com/sites/default/files/cvs-health-trade-association-and-coalition-participation-2020.pdf">donated</a> $5 million to the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF), a dark money group created to oppose Medicare for All and other legislation that would grant Americans greater health care access. According to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/21/cvs-lobby-health-insurance-medicare-for-all/"><em>The Intercept</em></a>, “The seven-figure donation from CVS is the largest known contribution to PAHCF.”</p>
<p>In a stunning <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewperezdc/status/1483143329986527236?t=EFyoPQztnpkvfKkJLMhDdw&s=19">display</a> of performative activism two days ago, CVS tweeted that “Health care is a right” to commemorate late civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal holiday honoring his life.</p>
<p>Perhaps CVS needs a reminder of Dr. King’s words before lining the pockets of a front group fighting universal health care: "Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results in physical death.”</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-clicks">TODAY’S CLICKS:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>POLL SHOWS SUPPORT FOR CONGRESSIONAL STOCK TRADING BAN: </strong>To House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s dismay, new online <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/67-percent-support-stock-trading-ban-congress-pelosi-data-progress-2022-1">polling</a> from progressive firm Data For Progress reveals that most voters support banning members of Congress and their senior staff from buying or selling stocks. The poll, which captured opinions of more than 1,200 likely American voters last week, found that 67 percent support a ban on trading stocks — with 74 percent in support and just 19 percent opposed when given arguments for and against the idea. The poll is timely, given <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/08/jon-ossoff-could-snub-nancy-pelosi-with-ban-on-congress-stock-trades/">recently introduced proposals</a> to ban stock trading in Congress. Just last month, Pelosi — who has <a href="__GHOST_URL__/midday-poster-pelosi-loves-the-market/">benefited immensely</a> from stock trades — dismissed the idea. “No… we are a free-market economy,” she responded when asked whether she supports such a ban.</li>
    <li><strong>RICH AMERICANS’ OUTSIZED ROLE IN ELECTING REPRESENTATIVES:</strong> A new <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/study-one-fourth-of-maxed-out-campaign-contributions-come-from-the-richest-1-of-zip-codes/">report</a> finds two-thirds of all “maxed-out” campaign donations to members of Congress came from the richest 10 percent of zip codes across the U.S., and 25 percent of all maxed-out contributions were from the wealthiest one percent of zip codes. The study, authored by consumer watchdog group Public Citizen, also shows that zip codes with mostly white residents gave five times the amount of maxed-out contributions per capita as zip codes with mostly Black residents. “This study confirms that the very wealthiest Americans play an immensely greater role than regular voters in choosing our elected officials, and that members of Congress have a strong incentive to align their positions with wealthy donors’ interests,” said Taylor Lincoln, Public Citizen’s Congress Watch division research director and author of the study. The Freedom to Vote Act — one of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/18/1073021462/senate-voting-rights-freedom-to-vote-john-lewis-voting-rights-advancement-act">two federal bills under debate</a> that creates stronger protections for voters — would offer a six-to-one match on political contributions of $200 or less and allow congressional candidates to raise campaign cash without relying on the wealthiest donors, as long as they agree to forgo donations over $1,000.</li>
    <li><strong>MASSIVE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN COVID-19 TREATMENT: </strong>According to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103e1.htm">recent study</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), patients who are Black, Asian, and “other” races (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and more) — as well as ethnically Hispanic patients — received lower rates of monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment for COVID-19 than white and non-Hispanic patients. “Hispanic patients received mAb 58% less often than did non-Hispanic patients, and Black, Asian, or Other race patients received mAb 22%, 48%, and 47% less often, respectively, than did White patients during November 2020–August 2021,” noted the report. While racial and ethnic disparities were greatest among patients receiving monoclonal antibody treatment, smaller disparities by race and ethnicity were also seen for inpatient remdesivir and dexamethasone administration.</li>
    <li><strong>MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR FILIBUSTER REFORM:</strong> New <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/19/a-majority-of-americans-support-fixing-the-filibuster-to-pass-the-freedom-to-vote-john-r-lewis-act">polling</a> from Data for Progress, in partnership with Equal Citizens and Un-PAC, found that 63 percent of likely voters support the voting rights package being debated by Democrats in D.C. this week. The survey further found that 53 percent of likely voters support changing the filibuster's 60-vote requirement to allow the voting rights legislation to pass by simple majority, with 35 percent opposed.</li>
