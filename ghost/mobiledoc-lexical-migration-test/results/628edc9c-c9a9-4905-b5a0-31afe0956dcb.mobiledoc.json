On the night of November 19, the Tesla app which owners use as the key to unlock and start their car went down. That meant there was no getting inside the cars since having a manual override would be stupid and backwards. Welcome to the future of driving."

But why would the media want to make the problem seem smaller than it actually is? What could they possibly gain by downplaying problems with electric cars?"

The extra keys were in the house, but my parents were on a trip, so I had to walk to my sibling’s house to get the extra house keys, to then walk to my house to get in and get the extra car keys, then walk back to my car. It took all morning to to do that, but the entire fiasco was due to my stupid mistake, not the failure of an app."

Maybe people will remember to keep the key on them in the future? But the most important takeaway from this is that electric  cars and snazzy apps to unlock your doors are perfect, so don’t question and especially don’t criticize them of you will be labeled an obstacle to progress."
