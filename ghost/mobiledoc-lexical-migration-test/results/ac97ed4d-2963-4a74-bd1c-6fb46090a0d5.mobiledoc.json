That’s fitting, considering Carroll Shelby is such a legendary name which should be remembered with nothing less than superior finish. The Grabber Lime paint really punctuates all this along with high-contrast stripes, trim, and wheels. This car no doubt will cause everyone, both car people and normals, to stop and stare in silent awe."
