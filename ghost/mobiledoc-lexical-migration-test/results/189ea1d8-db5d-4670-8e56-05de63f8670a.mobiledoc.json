This economic shift will play havoc with the supposed switch to electrification because if people are struggling just to keep an old car on the road, they’re sure won’t have cash for a $50,000 EV. Plus, if electricity prices and blackouts keep being all the rage in the UK in the coming years, electrification will be far less attractive."
