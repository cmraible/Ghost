<p>The IRS budget has been <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriel_zucman/status/1336521904648146945?s=21">cut in half</a> since 1992, draining the agency of the resources it needs to audit wealthy individuals, who are <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-now-audits-poor-americans-at-about-the-same-rate-as-the-top-1-percent">far less likely</a> to be audited today than they were a decade ago.

<p>It was less than two years ago that Sen. Dianne Feinstein <a href="https://twitter.com/_waleedshahid/status/1099076130089459712?s=20">disparaged young activists</a> from the Sunrise Movement who were asking her to commit to the Green New Deal. Feinstein asked the activists how old they were, and then told them, “I just won a big election” and “I know what I’m doing.” Last week, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/dianne-feinsteins-missteps-raise-a-painful-age-question-among-senate-democrats">New Yorker questioned</a> whether the oldest member of the Senate’s age is impeding her capacity to do her job.</p>

    <li><strong>PROFITABLE COMPANIES LAY OFF WORKERS, ENRICH SHAREHOLDERS: </strong>Poverty rates in the U.S. have grown faster this year than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/16/poverty-rising/">any other</a> year in recorded history, while 45 of the nation’s 50 largest public companies have turned a profit. How are they spending the cash? At least 21 of those profitable companies have laid off thousands of workers, according to a new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/50-biggest-companies-coronavirus-layoffs/?tid=ss_tw">Washington Post investigation.</a></li>
    <li><strong>THIS WEEK IN CLIMATE FINANCE: </strong>This week has been a mixed bag for action on climate from the government’s top financial regulators. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/008a12d2-7736-4db0-af9c-e063a0bcdd7a">Fed joined</a> the world’s largest central banks in committing to the goals of the Paris climate agreement, while the SEC <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-disclosure-resource-extraction/u-s-sec-votes-to-relax-requirements-on-companies-resource-extraction-disclosure-to-foreign-governments-idUSKBN28Q2CQ">finalized</a> a rule to help shield oil, gas, and mining company payments to public officials from the public eye, which we <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-oil-and-trump-are-trying-to-gut/">first reported </a>on last week.</li>
    <li><strong>HOUSE SPEAKER ELECTIONS: </strong>Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/nancy-pelosi-one-woman-congress/">valiant efforts</a> to block progressives from influencing the proceedings of the House of Representatives. Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/16/aoc-nancy-pelosi-needs-to-go-but-theres-nobody-to-replace-her-yet/">says Pelosi needs to be replaced</a> as speaker — but doesn’t know who should replace her, and is instead recommending progressives extract concessions in exchange for a vote for Pelosi.</li>
    <li><strong>STIMULUS TALK WHIRLWIND: </strong>Negotiations over an end-of-year stimulus package have been all over the place this week, will a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/16/congress-stimulus-checks-relief/">deal expected</a> soon. We’ve been tracking provisions that lawmakers are fighting over, like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/senate-proposal-would-retroactively/">blanket legal immunity</a> for corporations (which doesn’t seem to be in the final package) and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/stimulus-bill-bails-out-defense-contractors/">bailout</a> for defense contractors.</li>
