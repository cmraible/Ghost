<p>Last week, corporate media pundits were pretending to be outraged about media misinformation. But as our video shows, that very same week, NBC News and CNN hired two of the pundits who played a pivotal role promoting the fictions that pressed the country into the worst foreign policy disaster in modern history. They hired these pundits amid rising fears about a new war. Our new video is based on our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporate-media-is-the-misinformation-problem/">report last week</a>.</p>
<p>This is the kind of accountability journalism we do — but we can only do it because free subscribers have pitched in to become supporting subscribers.</p>
