<p>Two legendary muscle cars offered by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/learn-about-dodge-chargums/">Dodge</a>, the Challenger and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-charger-crashes-bus/">Charger</a> were first introduced to the world for the 1966 and 1970 model years, respectively. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/it-would-be-super-to-win-this-1969/">Dodge</a> still offers these two popular models decades later, and throughout its life in many different trims. Some were rowdy road models while others were barely street-legal. Check out the limited-production and special editions of the Charger and Challenger cars.</p>

<p>Back in February of 2005, a limited-production Dodge Charger was unveiled at Daytona International Speedway during Speedweek. Fans waited impatiently for the Charger's return to NASCAR Nextel Cup racing. Clad in a bright paint in either Metallic Orange or Top Banana with unique black Daytona and Hemi decals, the 2006 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ends-tomorrow-get-more-entires-to-win/">Dodge</a> Charger Daytona R/T featured special badging, a black trunk lid spoiler, a black honeycomb grille, and a unique front fascia and chin spoiler.</p>

<p>For the 2009 model year, the Dodge Challenger R/T Classic was introduced, which was reminiscent of its classic years but given modern styling and engineering. A new 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine was tucked under the hood and backed by a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission. Drivers had world-class handling at their fingertips along with tight turning and easy steering. Other features included the full independent sport-tuned suspension, dual exhaust, and alloy wheels wrapped with high-performance rubber.</p>

Only 22 Charger Super Bees were powered by a 426-cubic-inch Hemi V8 engine, and that number is narrowed down to 13 when paired with an automatic transmission. </p>

<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1969-dodge-charger-daytona/">1969 Dodge</a> Charger 500 Hemi could reach a top speed of 172 mph thanks to engineers making it more aerodynamic by adding a flush-mounted rear window over the recessed back and a Coronet grille to the nose to keep the car planted to the ground.</p>
<p>Only 392 examples of the '69 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-dodge-charger-500/">Dodge Charger 500</a> were built this way in compliance with NASCAR qualification rules.

<p>Not many people will be graced by the presence of the rare 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T Hemi Convertible considering just 9 were built for the model year. Created to rival the Pontiac Firebird and Mercury Cougar, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-challenger-r-t-is-both-show/">'70 Challenger</a> R/T Hemi Convertible was one of two cars to sit atop Chrysler's E-body platform.

<p>For the 1969 model year, the Dodge Charger Daytona was created to compete in the world of NASCAR. With a massive wing out back, the car looked like a Charger that was ready to take flight. After its last race in Charlotte in 1970, the Charger Daytona was retired as a race car, but varying engine options were available during its production run.</p>
<p>And that sums up our list of special edition Challengers and Chargers to ever roll off Dodge's assembly line in the Motor City. From classic muscle to new-school powerhouses, you can't go wrong with any of these amazing Mopar models.</p>
