Players will assume the role of an ace spacecraft pilot as they fly about the milky way, battling pirates and enemy combatants while buying and selling goods at different ports to earn a profit. Fans of dogfighting games might be looking towards this game as the newest entry into the genre but unlike some of its competitors, this game advertises an in-depth economy to liven its world a bit."

Attacking will be especially frustrating in the early game as your weapon options are limited and they will overheat before defeating a single person. A weapon overheating will drastically reduce it’s firerate to an annoyingly slow speed and can only be solved by simply waiting for the gun to cool down, which can lead to awkward situations of following your enemy in a way that doesn’t feel like a chase at all and waiting for you to be able to open fire again.

The game takes place in the far future and every planet has its own governing body, or at least it seems that way as one could argue this is already a fictitious setting, just with the planets named “Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars” and so on.

It honestly feels like something one could buy from a royalty-free site. As far as the sound design goes, the sounds of the ship engines and energy weapon fire are convincing enough. However, the voice acting isn’t great at all. Your pilot will often react to the situation, growling when hit by enemy fire, commenting on the quality of the take off from a port (arbitrarily since you have no control over that), and so on. The actor doesn’t do a great job and I find his commentary more of a hindrance on the immersion than it assists it. "
