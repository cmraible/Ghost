<hr>
<p>Nobody likes being pulled over by the police. After all, the situation is nerve-wracking as you wonder how much a ticket will cost and what other consequences you might be facing. For the cop, it’s also a stressful situation because it’s one of the most dangerous things they can do. That was clearly illustrated when 38-year-old Delaware resident Milton Jermaine Lewis dragged a Virginia State Police trooper for three miles.</p>

<p>According to Virginia State Police, the incident in question started just after 4 pm on December 2 when the trooper clocked Lewis going 97 mph in a 70-mph zone on southbound Interstate 295. After the trooper pulled over Lewis’ 2021 Mazda CX-30, the trooper wisely approached the passenger side so he wouldn’t be hit by other drivers. Little did he know he was about to go on a wild ride.</p>
<p>Virginia State Police say Lewis “was non-compliant” but didn’t get specific about what the man was or was not doing. At some point the trooper opened the passenger door, maybe because Lewis wouldn’t roll down the window? We don’t know.</p>
<p>Lewis decided speeding off instead of just talking civilly with the trooper was the best course of action, so he gunned it, causing the passenger door to close and pin the trooper. Probably panicking because he knew he’d really stepped in it, Lewis pushed the little Mazda grocery getter to 115 mph as he drug the trooper for three miles.</p>
<p>While giving the trooper a wild ride, Lewis also hit two semi-trucks and crashed. You can see in the photo provided by police that the front end of the Mazda is pretty well crumpled. After the vehicle was disabled, Lewis took off on foot. It took authorities about two hours to track down and arrest him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the trooper only sustained minor, non-life-threatening injuries. If you think that’s a miracle, the situation could’ve been much worse. Police discovered a handgun in the Mazda. Thankfully Lewis didn’t pull that out during the altercation or the trooper might not have survived. Still, he’s facing a long list of charges including reckless driving by speeding, felony eluding of a police officer, having a concealed weapon, altering a serial number on a firearm, felony assault of a law enforcement officer, abduction, attempted capital murder, failure to maintain control of a vehicle, no seatbelt, felony hit and run.</p>
