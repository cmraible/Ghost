See, the thing a lot of people don’t realize is the smaller automakers are struggling to make electric vehicles because they’re expensive to develop and produce. If you think consolidation in the auto industry has made all cars look the same for a sea of blandness, electrification will make that problem far worse."

The report does mention a “recapitalization” effort, but since nothing is official the details are murky.

After all, we need more independent, creative automakers instead of more of the same."
