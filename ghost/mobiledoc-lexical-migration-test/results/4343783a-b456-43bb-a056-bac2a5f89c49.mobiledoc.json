Held at the impressive Dapitan City Government Center, vehicle owners, locals, and tourists all flocked to check out the many rides and rub shoulders with other enthusiasts."

Among those he showed off was a Porsche 356, plus a Land Rover and a Volkswagen, although we’re not sure of the models for those two."

This may not be the first that Dapitan facilitated and held an auto moto show competition but this the grandest so far,” said Apple Marie Agolong, Dapitan tourism officer."

Apparently Dapitan is a big tourist destination for the province and region, with the car show helping to draw people in and add to the city’s status. While some people might not understand why, we certainly love to visit car shows in different places, especially when on vacation. It’s a great way to see how the car culture is both different and the same all over."
