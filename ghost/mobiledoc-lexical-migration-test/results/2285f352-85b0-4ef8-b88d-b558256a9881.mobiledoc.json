          "Kevin Hart has impeccable taste in cars, especially muscle cars, with an affinity for Dodge muscle car, specially old school Dodge muscle cars. The comedian first became a subject of Motorious coverage back a few years ago when he gifted his touring entourage their favorite collectible cars, and went on to captivate our readers with his saga of the 1970 'Cuda, known as \"Menace\", both when he bought it, when someone else wrecked it while he was in the passenger seat, and the chaos that unfolded. Now, Kevin Hart has embarked on a new automotive journey behind the wheel of a 1000-horspower 1970 Dodge Charger."

Stopping power comes from Brembo brakes, and the impressive Dodge muscle car rolls on a set of HRE S201 3-piece wheels, wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires."
