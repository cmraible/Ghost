The naturally aspirated four-cylinder has an output of 94-bhp and a maximum torque at 91 lb/ft and can reach a top speed of 115 miles per hour.  A four-speed manual transmission shifts power down to the rear wheels."

Porsche introduced the new 911 this same year but continued to sell the 356 in North America through 1965 due to high demand. While the Porsche 911 was a capable car, it was heavier and not yet established like the 356 at the time."
