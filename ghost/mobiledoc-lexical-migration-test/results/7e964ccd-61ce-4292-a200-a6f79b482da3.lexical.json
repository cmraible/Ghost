Then we’d love to see you at Hacks/Hackers Brighton, because there are some great things in store:*\n\nThe next Hacks/Hackers Brighton meet-up is tomorrow (**Tuesday, 4 September, 6pm at The Eagle**). All are welcome. (Here’s the [meet up group](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Brighton/) if you’d like to tell us you are coming)\n\nIt’s an extra special meetup with an excellent speaker, it’s part of the Brighton Digital Festival, plus you will hear about how Hacks/Hackers Brighton will be part of the Mini Maker Faire on Saturday 8 and you’ll find out about a Hacks/Hackers UK event in November.\n\n**Joanna Geary, digital development editor at *The Guardian*, will be speaking about community clinics, among other things.**\n\n*The Guardian*‘s approach to open journalism sees the news outlet reach out to its readers in many different ways, including through soon-to-launch** community clinics**.\n\nWe are also planning a “**pop-up digital newsroom**” on Saturday 8 September. We’d like as many people as possible to get involved. We will explain more at the meet-up.\n\n**Pop-up newsroom**: Hacks/Hackers Brighton is becoming a Maker at the Mini Maker Faire. From 10am-2pm the Founders Room at the Brighton Dome will become a digital newsroom, allowing those who attend the Maker Faire to learn skills in digital news production. The event is free and all are welcome.\n\n\n## What is the Mini Maker Faire?\n\nMaker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth – a family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity and resourcefulness, and a celebration of the Maker movement. It’s a place where people show what they are making, and share what they are learning. Activities for all ages include arts & crafts, robots and engineering, wood and metalwork, electronics, science, tech, music and more amazing do-it-yourself creation.\n\nOver 5,000 people piled into the Dome for the first Brighton Mini Maker Faire in 2011, to witness the mind-boggling home-made creations of the best inventors, crafters, hackers and DIY-ers from across the UK – and they got involved: making, experimenting, playing, learning and interacting.\n\n*Brighton Digital Festival is a celebration of digital culture. It is run by members of Brighton’s arts and digital communities, administered by Wired Sussex in association with Lighthouse and supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.*\n\n\n"
