<hr>
<p>A number of automakers (including Ford, Chrysler and General Motors) have already announced a transition from car manufacturing to the production of medical supplies such as ventilators and respirators, and now the aftermarket industry is stepping up as well to help boost production of life-saving equipment. <a href="https://glickenhausracing.com/">Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus</a>, Ford-tuner <a href="https://www.steeda.com/">Steeda</a> and Michigan-based <a href="https://truck-hero.com/">Truck Hero</a> are just a few examples of companies that are providing help during this challenging global Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On March 21st, boutique exotic car maker Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus came forward on social media and offered to let the nearby hospital utilize its brand-new factory in Danbury, Connecticut. This 40,000-square-foot facility was scheduled to start building 100 SCG004 supercars per year, but instead this space could be used as a makeshift hospital to help doctors and nurses treat patients who test positive for Covid-19.

<p>Then on March 24, the company revealed that it is developing a low-cost solution for hospital masks that can be sterilized. A prototype mask is already well into development, and if approved, Glickenhaus will be able to quickly manufacture "hundreds of thousands" of masks for health care professionals.</p>
<p>That same day, Georgia-based Steeda said that it is willing to help build just about anything required to help doctors, hospitals and those afflicted by the coronavirus. Normally, Steeda is cranking out high-performance aftermarket components for Ford products (especially the Mustang), but the company's recent post on Facebook suggests Steeda has the ability and capacity to build anything from ventilators to hospital beds.
