<p>While it is no secret <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2007-ferrari-f430-13/">that Ferrari</a> makes a beautiful car the real appeal of <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2007-ferrari-f430-13/">the F430</a> is all in the drive. Finished in Ruby Red Mica over a Cuoio leather interior, this Ferrari appears to be almost just as it was when it was delivered to Scottsdale Ferrari of Arizona back in 2007. It came equipped with polished 19″ split-spoke wheels, Scuderia <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2007-ferrari-f430-13/">Ferrari fender</a> shields, parking sensors, Daytona-style seats, carbon-fiber trim, a Hi-Fi stereo system, and of course a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed F1 automated manual transaxle and an electronically controlled differential. 13K miles from new, the car shows and as displayed by the driving video, drives as would be expected from mile one. </p>

<p><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2007-ferrari-f430-13/">This particular car</a> most recently changed hands in 2018, when it was acquired by the current owner who added 3K of the 13K miles on the odometer. It has since been serviced in anticipation of the sale and comes complete with service records, a tool kit, an owner’s manual, a Carfax report, and of course a clean title. According to the Carfax report, the car's front bumper was refinished in 2008 though it is not noticeable today. </p>
