<p>A crash involving a 1957 Chevy Bel Air and a modern Ford F-150 in Wiggins, Mississippi left one dead. According to a local report, the husband and wife in the Tri-Five were headed to Cruisin’ the Coast, a classic car festival which has been running since 1996.</p>

<p>The local report says the ’57 Chevy was traveling south on Highway 49 on the afternoon of October 5 when the Ford F-150 started to cross the highway to reach a service road on the other side. The Bel Air T-boned the pickup. If that was at speed, the crash had to have been quite violent.</p>
<p>Authorities say the deceased, 67-year-old Sherry Arrington of Terry, Mississippi, was a passenger in the Chevy. Her husband, who was driving, was transported to the hospital and was in stable condition. The driver of the Ford was taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries while a child passenger was unharmed.</p>
<p>By now you’ve probably seen controlled crashes between classic and modern crashes. If not, you can check out a compilation <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/are-old-cars-unsafe/">here</a>. Thanks to all kinds of innovations, cars made in the past couple decades or so overall fare much better in crashes. Even with all those innovations, if you’re in a car and T-bone a full-size truck, you’re lucky to walk away. It’s an even worse scenario in a classic car like the ’57 Bel Air.</p>
<p>Police were still investigating the crash, so no blame has been assigned yet. Still, this is a potent reminder that whenever you’re driving you need to remain vigilant. That’s harder to remember when you’re pleasure cruising in your classic on the way to an event, but unfortunately you can be involving in an accident even if you don’t do anything wrong.</p>
