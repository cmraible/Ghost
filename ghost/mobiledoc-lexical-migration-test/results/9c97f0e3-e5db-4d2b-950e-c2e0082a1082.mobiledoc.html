<p><em>The Daily Poster</em>’s David Sirota was the featured guest on last week’s edition of <em>The Intercept’s</em> podcast <em>Deconstructed</em>. Sirota talked with reporter Ryan Grim about his new series <em>MELTDOWN</em>, and the cautionary lessons the Obama era should have taught Democrats about the current moment. They discussed those lessons in the context of the ongoing battle in Congress over whether to scale back Democrats’ promised economic agenda.</p>
