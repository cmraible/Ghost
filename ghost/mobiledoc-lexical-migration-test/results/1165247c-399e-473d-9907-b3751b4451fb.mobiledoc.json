The reasons people don’t like when their neighbors own cool vehicles can vary and we don’t like to read minds, but we think deep down inside these lovely individuals are really jealous. After all, they typically drive some boring toaster and lead a life of misery, so when they see someone having fun they just have to bring them down. Misery certainly does enjoy the company."

Apparently, there’s a feud going on with some of his neighbors who just don’t like his vehicles. We haven’t watched all his videos, but we get the impression they complain about any noise above the level of what a Prius makes."

To make a point, the YouTuber ditched it an bought a second-gen Camaro he knew the neighbors would find far more annoying."

Seriously, if you have speakers on your computer and are around other people who are easily disturbed, you might want to hook up headphones before giving the video a whirl, it’s that loud."
