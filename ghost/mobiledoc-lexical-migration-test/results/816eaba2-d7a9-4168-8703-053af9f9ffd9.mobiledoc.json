It all started when the stolen vehicle’s Bosch system automatically reported it was involved in an accident. When officers arrived they found the Audi had fled the scene."

We’re guessing the kids panicked at seeing police, because they hit a patrol car, which thankfully wasn’t occupied at the time. That’s when a second officer turned on his emergency lights to pull the Audi over, but that’s when the driver tore out of the hotel parking lot."

Now, one paid with his life and at least one other is facing the possibility of spending a long time incarcerated."
