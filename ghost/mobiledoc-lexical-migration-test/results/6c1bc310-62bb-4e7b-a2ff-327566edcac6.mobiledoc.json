Complementing this hellacious engine are other upgrades such as the six-speed manual gearbox, four-wheel coilovers, a Ford nine-inch rear end and Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes with drilled and slotted rotors, while those massive 335/30ZR18 rear tires mounted on custom wheels lay down a solid contact patch. This Mopar is more than just a show car, too, as it participated in the 2018 Hot Rod Power Tour spanning several events across the Southeast."

That's why this '74 Barracuda looks like an earlier model with the dual headlight grille of a '71 and the horizontally slotted taillights used on the 1970 and 1971 models. The bright orange paint job and exposed carbon fiber accents makes this car hard to miss. As custom as the exterior is, the inside of this Mopar goes full stock car with removable windows, a roll cage with racing harnesses, a massive fuel cell mounted in the trunk and a custom console with an assortment of switches."
