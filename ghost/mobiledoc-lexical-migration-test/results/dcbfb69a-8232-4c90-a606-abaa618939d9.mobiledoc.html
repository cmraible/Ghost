<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-1943-willys-mb-jeep-travel-550-miles-off-road/">Adventure is calling</a> and it’s your decision to heed it or remain in boredom. One great way to head into the outdoors without <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/interactive-off-road-driving-videos/">feeling insulated from your surroundings</a> is to drive a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/off-road/">off-roader</a> that’s nice and open, like this Toyota FJ43. It features a removable soft top and fold-down windshield, so you can feel the wind blow through your hair and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2016-land-rover/">enjoy the beautiful outdoors</a> without any obstructions.</p>

<p>While you no doubt are familiar with the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/bid-on-this-1976-toyota-fj40-restomod/">Toyota FJ40</a>, one of the most sought-after classic off-roaders on the market, you might not know as much about the FJ43. A quick glance will let you know there’s more than a passing resemblance with the FJ40. In fact, the FJ43 is essentially the same rig, only with a longer wheelbase and more room in the rear. Their production was limited, especially in North America, making them even more valuable than the mighty FJ40s today.</p>
<p>This particular FJ43 uses that extra room in the rear to fit two bench seats, making this the perfect safari vehicle. The seat bottoms can fold up to make more room if you need to haul more gear, providing quite a bit of flexibility. Of course, up front there’s seating for up to three people, although the middle passenger will have to sacrifice legroom to the floor-mounted transmission and transfer case shifters.</p>
<p>A full restoration by Vintage Land Company adhered closely to factory specifications, with the OE chassis, engine, and drivetrain all used. In other words, this is not a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/bid-on-this-1976-toyota-fj40-restomod/">restomod</a> but instead is a pure representation of what Toyota built half a century ago.</p>
<p>The Cygnus White paint looks fantastic, pairing nicely with the included Uran Red canvas top and leather seats. Even the smallest details have been restored with care, including all the interior lights and gauges. A tool roll and jack are included, along with a book detailing the restoration work.</p>
