<p>Do you realise that the moonbase-and-space-travel future of <em>Space 1999</em> should have arrived <em>21 years ago</em>?</p>
<p>I feel cheated.</p>
<p>(I do still have the Eagle Transporter model I bought as a child, though…)</p>
<p>OK, I know you came for the fresh SEO updates, not personal ramblings. Sorry. I'm slipping into my anecdotage. </p>

<h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-intent">It's all about the Intent</h2>
<p>If you've been trained by me, you'll know this. But this reinforces what I've been saying - think less about keywords, more about <em>intent</em>.</p>

<h3 id="mummy-don-t-take-away-my-keywords-">Mummy, don't take away my keywords…</h3>
<p>The article below feels a little bit like clutching at straws. It's clear that the direction of travel is towards <em>intent</em> being the critical element of search not keywords. I've said that before in this very post. I might yet say it again. </p>
<p>But a whole industry that has built up around keywords isn't going to let go easily. So, here they find a crumb of comfort in an official video from Google. </p>

<h2 id="new-google-core-update-13th-january">New Google core update: 13th January</h2>
<p>New year, new core update. On January 13th Google made one of its major core updates - but we don't have any information on specific changes yet. That'll come in the next few days, as SEOs analyse what they see:</p>

<p>When this happens, you want to pay careful attention to your search analytics, to see if you've been impacted.</p>
<h2 id="how-google-uses-sub-headings">How Google uses sub-headings</h2>
<p>This is a wierd one (as seems common with SEO blogs). The main article makes a bunch of assertions that aren't really backed up by the quotes from the Google employee he uses. In essence, the core message here is twofold:</p>
<ol>
    <li>No, just putting keywords in headings won't help you rank better</li>
    <li>However, well-written sub-headings, which are informative to the reader, will also help Google understand the content better, and thus rank it for appropriate keywords.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words: use subheadings - but write them for the reader's benefit, and get the SEO benefit for free.</p>
