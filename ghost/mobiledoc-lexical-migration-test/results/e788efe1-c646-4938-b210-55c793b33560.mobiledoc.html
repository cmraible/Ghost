<p>The Chevrolet Impala seems to have been around for ions, and despite a couple of hiatuses, GM still produces a current <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevrolet-impala-1958-2020/">Impala</a> model to this day. While the car may not have been around for ions, per se, but it has been around for quite a few decades considering that 1958 was its very first model year. Let's talk about the 1964 model year, the last model of the third-generation as well as the final year to sit atop GM's X-Frame. <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/inventory/dealer/Ideal+Classic+Cars">Ideal Classic Cars</a> is excited to offer the chance to own this gorgeous <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/196633/1964-chevrolet-impala-ss-409">1964 Chevrolet Impala SS 409</a> with a powerplant that has been stroked into something more sinister. </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/1964-impala.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="<img src=" 1964-impala.jpeg" alt="A 1964 Chevrolet Impala 409 built into a 482 stroker">" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>For 1964, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1996-chevrolet-impala-ss-collectible/">Impala</a> was updated to show off a rounder and softer appearance, and the SS (Super Sport) model became its very own series. Sprayed in a glossy Tuxedo black in pristine condition, this elegant <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ride-low-and-slow-in-this-1964-chevy-impala-wagon/">'64 Impala</a> SS is bound to steal the show whether it's cruising down main street to the grocery store or participating in any car show. A set of custom 20-inch wheels are bolted all around and add that perfect pop of chrome against its dark aesthetic. Behind the doors sits a stealthy black interior complete with bucket seats and a console.</p>
<p>Although this gem features the 409 badging on the side, the big-block V8 offered for this model year, something more menacing lurks underneath the hood of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1960-chevrolet-impala-production-video/">Impala</a>. The 409-cubic-inch V8 has been built into a massive and powerful 482-cubic-inch stroker. The 482ci is fed by two four-barrel carburetors and features a ISKY camshaft, forged crank, Offenhauser finned aluminum valve covers, and spent gases exit through electric exhaust cutouts. Power is sent down through a Posi-traction rear end stuffed with 3.31 gears via a 4-speed manual transmission that is mated to a Hurst Competition Plus shifter.</p>
