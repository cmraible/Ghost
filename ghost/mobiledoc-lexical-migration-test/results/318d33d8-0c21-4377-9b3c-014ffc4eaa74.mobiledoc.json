One grannie decided to celebrate a century on this planet by taking a ride in a convertible C7 Corvette and we think that’s great. After all, even at 100 we imagine the need for speed, despite the inability to drive a vehicle any longer, is still alive and well in those who are still truly living."

While she got a nice birthday crown, a cake, attendance by a color guard plus legion riders and other veterans, plus plenty of fanfare for the large celebration, the highlight was when her nurse granted her wish, taking the centenarian for a spin in his very own Corvette."

          "We imagine Marian and her nurse Robert had many conversations about the American sports car. A local news report says that when Marian’s family visits daily, she always points out the ‘Vette when it’s sitting in the parking lot. In other words, she’s had a long love affair with the Chevy and finally realized the dream of riding in it."

Technology has come a long way, with vehicles getting bigger, more powerful, and more complicated over the decades. No wonder she’s been so fascinated with the C7 Corvette."
