<p>We don't see a lot of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/where-left-it-84-porsche-911/">convertible</a> muscle cars, and there's a few good reasons why. They tend to be heavier and less rigid than <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-find-1969-dodge-charger-r-t-magnum-440-has-been-parked-for-22-years/">their enclosed counterparts</a>, which puts them at a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-this-1967-pontiac-gto/">performance</a> disadvantage.</p>
<p>As a result, droptop muscle cars are pretty rare compared to their coupe counterparts. That's especially true for the upper echelon of the segment.</p>

<p>In 1971, just 11 Plymouth 'Cuda convertibles were built with the might 426 Hemi. These rare machines have been known to fetch millions of dollars at collector car auctions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0121-444541/1971-plymouth-cuda-convertible/">This 1971 Plymouth 'Cuda convertible</a> is expected to reach seven-figure territory, even without Hemi power. It's one of just 17 built with the 440 Six Pack under the hood.</p>

<p>"Six Pack" refers to the big engine's induction setup â€“ a trio of two-barrel carburetors. It was the next best thing to Hemi power, and offered similar performance.</p>
<p>The Hemi boasted 425 horsepower and 490 torque, while the 440 Six Pack boasted the same torque with less peak horsepower. Either engine in a 'Cuda made it a formidable opponent on the street or the strip. Droptop or not, 440 Six Pack 'Cudas had no problems dispatching lesser machinery.</p>
