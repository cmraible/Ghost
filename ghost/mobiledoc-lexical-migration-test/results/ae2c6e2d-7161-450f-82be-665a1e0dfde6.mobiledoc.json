While that’s not the end of the world, it certainly will hurt the company’s revenue and is liable to make some people eagerly awaiting their new bike at least a little upset."

The only thing the company will disclose is that the info had something to do with “a regulatory compliance matter relating to the supplier’s component part.”"

It could be something about emissions. It could be something regarding safety. Or it could be something else your average owner would never even notice. Whatever it is, Harley brass thought it was important enough to bring everything grind to a halt for 14 days."

After a few months, the company had to lay off some workers as production resumed but was reduced in response to a drop in demand. Then in October of 2020 Harley announced it was leaving India, the largest motorcycle market in the world. Many predicted it would spell the ultimate doom for the company."
