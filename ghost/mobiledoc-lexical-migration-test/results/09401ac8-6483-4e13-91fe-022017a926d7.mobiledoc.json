In this case, Chevy's signature Hugger Orange hue is paired with white racing stripes and a white vinyl roof, but the best part about this car's look is the lowered stance with three-piece wheels (19 inches front and 20 inches rear) filling out the wheel wells. The interior is equally spotless with only a few modern touches (like the stereo and shifter) to break up the otherwise original-looking cabin."
