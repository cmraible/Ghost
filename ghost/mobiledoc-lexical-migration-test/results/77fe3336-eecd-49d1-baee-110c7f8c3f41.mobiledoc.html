<p><strong>Developed By </strong>Funselektor Labs<br><strong>Published By </strong>Funselektor<strong><br>Genre </strong>Racing / Simulation / Arcade<strong><br>Rating </strong>E<strong><br>Players </strong>1<br>This self proclaimed zen game is something really special and presents a welcome challenge. Get ready for precise driving and lots of crashing/practice in this arcade style driving game focused entirely on the automotive art of drifting. It breaks the mold of most driving games and what you wind up with is a game that's fun and challenging but never feels unfair or overly technical. The simplicity is where it really shines: the controls, graphics and concept are all bare bones and better off for it.</p>

<p><strong>Developed By </strong>Raredrop Games<br><strong>Published By </strong>PQube<strong><br>Genre </strong>Strategy / RPG<strong><br>Rating </strong>E10+<strong><br>Players </strong>1 - 2<br><em>WARBORN </em>is a simpler version of <em>Fire Emblem</em> set in space, and that’s not a bad thing. It takes the fun head-scratching combat that makes the genre great and takes away the extraneous fluff like an arbitrary overworld and overly complicated story. Things like this may add to the complexity of a game, but they don’t always add to the enjoyment. <em>WARBORN </em>strips that away and keeps the bones intact.</p>

<p>Snuggle up with your switch and a nice cup of hot cocoa and a blanket overtop this holiday season with <em>WINGSPAN - </em>you won't regret it one bit. For all intents and purposes, this bird-themed board game makes the leap from coffee table to small screen in spectacular fashion - it's infectiously cute in all the right places, and is intuitive to a T. If there's a card game to get on the Switch, or a board game for that matter, then <em>WINGSPAN </em>is the one to nab.</p>
