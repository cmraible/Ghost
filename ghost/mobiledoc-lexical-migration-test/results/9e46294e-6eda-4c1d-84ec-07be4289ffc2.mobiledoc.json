This car was actually the co-creation of Shelby and Dan Fitzgerald, whom you might know because of Fitzgerald Motorsports. They planned on make 50 of these, with 25 being coupes and the other 25 roadsters, but thanks to Shelby’s medical issues and subsequent hospitalization the project was scrapped. That’s how this is the only GTS CS in existence."

Most know the Cobra was the original inspiration for Dodge’s snake, but this car makes an even stronger connection with details like an open grille and similar racing stripes. Adding to the flair is a red exterior and red interior, because this prototype wasn’t built for subtlety."

They also installed 3.73 rear gears and 18-inch lightweight wheels for less unsprung mass. For good measure, this car comes with racing harnesses, signaling it’s not just another Viper."
