<p>Inside the engine bay, atop the engine, are performance upgrades that add to the clean engine compartment, like chrome valve covers and air cleaner, a aluminum 360 intake, a Holley double pumper built by the Carburetor Shop, with competition heads, breathing through Hedman hot jet coated headers, and Flowmaster triple chambered mufflers. The drivetrain feeds in to a 3:73 positraction rear end with traction bars, and gets stopping power from front disc brakes with rear drums.</p>
