Speaking of the track, there is a need for safety concerns in this car either because it's also got a full cage to provide rigidity and safety. The suspension is fully adjustable RideTech suspension and the engine is also mated to the T56 Magnum. The exterior is meant to look as much like a stock 1966 Mustang as possible, however, the wheels and tires on this thing are almost impossible to fit without rubbing stock so it does have some minor body modification. The front is a Maier Racing fiberglass front end with a 2-inch flare and a 3-inch flare in the back.",
