<p>This was the first passenger car from Europe to use a turbocharger, and that alone makes it notable. The 2002 had already earned a reputation for excellent road manners, but BMW engineers decided to spice things up by adding a turbo to the 2.0-liter engine, producing 170-horsepower. You can drive it at lower RPMs and the car is actually quite tame, but let the engine rev to 4,000 rpm and the turbo dials things up to a new level of performance.  A 4-speed manual transmission allows for proper performance driving</p>
<p>For a purist presentation, this 2002 Turbo wears the correct Chamonix-White paint after a thorough professional restoration. On the exterior are also the turbo and tri-strip graphics, plus original badges. Styling elements which make this Turbo immediately distinguishable from other 2002 models include the more muscular wheel arches, trunk lid-mounted spoiler, and sportier front air dam.</p>
<p>To look at the black vinyl interior, you’d think the pictures were straight from the original BMW sales brochure. Everything from the carpeting to the headliner is absolutely immaculate. All factory controls are present, plus you get a bright red gauge cluster bezel which contrasts with the rest of the interior.</p>
<p>Thanks largely to the global oil crisis at the time, BMW only made 1,672 2002 Turbos. That means these rarely exchange hands, so the opportunity to own one is quite exceptional. This particular car comes with a BMW Classic Certificate and original documentation.</p>
