Some might mockingly suggest that means this classic is a has-been, but fools toss away valuable treasures all the time. We think you all can appreciate this real gem of a classic American muscle car."

The last owner had it for 40 years, and as you can see from the photos it looks to have been cared for tenderly. Mostly original with one repaint in the original factory color, this Pontiac is almost like a time capsule."

Even better, the dealer indicates the engine runs strong, plus it comes with an upgraded QuadraJet carb, HEI ignition, headers, and dual exhaust for plenty of fun on the go. A Turbo 400 is bolted up to the engine, while the 10-bolt rear comes with 3.73 gears. Whoever buys this car should be able to start enjoying it immediately instead of having to diagnose all kinds of vexing mechanical problems."

Even better, the second owner kept it in a climate controlled barn, so it was living the good life even in the frigid winters."
