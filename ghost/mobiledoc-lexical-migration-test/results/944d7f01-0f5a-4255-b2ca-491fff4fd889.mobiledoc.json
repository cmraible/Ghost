A combination of great performance and unforgettable looks made the car a legend to car people everywhere. However, even the best cars of the 1960s are subject to the aging process of all cars. This particular example has somehow been kept in pretty good condition despite having only been built while the Firebird was in its first generation."

Everything about the car, right down to the shine in its paint looked perfect and, after some quick consideration it was time to see what kind of company it keeps. Along with the Firebird a very handsome looking Mercury Cougar can also be seen. This car would have been the pinnacle of Ford/Mercury luxury performance cars in its time."
