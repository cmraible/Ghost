By the time August 2014 rolled around, Aston Martin rolled out some changes to the Aston Martin Vanquish, including technical modifications. These advancements included an all-new 8-speed Touchtronic III transmission. The AM29 V12 engine was also upgraded and had a power output of 568-horsepower and 465 lbs-ft of torque. These upgrades vastly improved the performance characteristics, including an acceleration of 0 to 62 mph of only 3.6-seconds and a scorching top speed of 201 mph."
