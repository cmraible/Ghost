This is just something for my regulars, if you like, and those they choose to share it with.\n\nI’m going to start doing a newsletter in the next few days, which will be called the Digital Publishing Irregular.\n\nIt will be, as the name suggests, about digital publishing, and it will be irregular. It will be more opinionated and broad than posts on this blog, and will represent, in many ways, the first draft of ideas that will eventually make their way here.\n\nIf you’re interested in this, feel free to sign-up below:\n\n<form action=\"https://tinyletter.com/oneman\" method=\"post\" onsubmit=\"window.open('https://tinyletter.com/oneman', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;padding:3px;text-align:center;\" target=\"popupwindow\"><label for=\"tlemail\">Enter your email address</label><input id=\"tlemail\" name=\"email\" style=\"width:140px\" type=\"text\"></input><input name=\"embed\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\"></input><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\"></input>[powered by TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com)\n\n</form>Expect occasional missives thereafter…\n\n\n"
