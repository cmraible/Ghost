<h2 id="the-footnote-that-says-it-all">The Footnote That Says It All</h2>
<p>By <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/andrew-perez/">Andrew Perez</a></p>
<p>With the Supreme Court beginning to issue new rulings as part of a term that features cases that could end affirmative action at colleges, allow businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ+ customers, and give state legislatures full oversight of federal elections, it’s worth re-reading a footnote in a recent book by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) that explains how exactly we got here.</p>
<p>In October, Whitehouse published his book, <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/scheme"><em>The Scheme: How the Right Wing Used Dark Money to Capture the Supreme Court</em></a>. The book lays out in great detail how conservatives used a network of dark money nonprofits, fueled by anonymous cash, to install right-wing justices on the Supreme Court and build a lasting 6-3 majority.</p>
<p>Among other revelations, Whitehouse’s book includes a lengthy footnote that offers an important mea culpa and confesses truths that Democratic politicians almost never admit: that they deserve significant blame for the state of the American judiciary:</p><!--members-only-->
<p>“While the focus of this book is the Republican-backed dark money scheme that has captured the court, a moment of reflection — and confession — on our side is in order,” he begins. “On a great many occasions, Democrats at many levels failed to fight as the scheme progressed. It was worse than appeasement; it was acceptance.”</p>
<p>The issue of dark money in politics arose out of the Supreme Court’s 2010 <em>Citizens United</em> decision, which allowed corporations and nonprofits, which are not required to disclose their donors, to spend unlimited sums on politics. The decision helped open the floodgates for ultra-wealthy individuals to influence elections and remain anonymous.</p>
<p><em>The Lever</em> has reported extensively on the Supreme Court scheme laid out by Whitehouse. President Donald Trump’s judicial adviser Leonard Leo helped select Trump’s high court picks while <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dark-money-went-in-supreme-court-rulings-are-coming-out/">leading a dark money network</a> that boosted their confirmations with TV ads and bankrolled the politicians and nonprofits bringing and supporting precedent-shaping cases before the high court — such as the decision last year overturning federal protections for abortion rights.</p>
<p>Whitehouse notes that Democrats gave up on fighting climate change in the Obama era, and did little as Republicans scandalized efforts at the Internal Revenue Service to scrutinize whether politically active dark money groups should maintain their tax exempt status.</p>
<p>“For years, we didn’t force a vote on DISCLOSE,” he writes, referencing legislation that would compel companies to publicly disclose their donations to politically active nonprofits as well as to dark money groups spending on judicial confirmation fights.</p>
<p>Democrats finally held another vote on the DISCLOSE Act last fall. But the measure <a href="__GHOST_URL__/disclose-act-fails/">failed along party lines</a> again — just as it did in 2010 and 2012 — because Democrats have refused to end or reform the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation</p>
<p>Whitehouse notes that Democrats said little over the past decade as the Supreme Court issued “donor-friendly” ruling after ruling. “In confirmation hearings, we concerned ourselves more with nominees’ stances on ‘the issues’ than on the machinery that put them there,” he continues. “We were sleeping sentries.”</p>
<p>The senator further adds that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had only spotlighted the issue of dark money one time each during the first year of their administration. “Worse, the President’s Commission on the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SCOTUS-Report-Final-12.8.21-1.pdf">papered</a> over this entire problem without a mention,” he writes.</p>
<p>He concludes, “Our sins were of omission not commission, for sure; we were the sleepy guard, not the crafty burglar. Nevertheless, they must be faced, and I acknowledge them here.”</p>

<p>In an interview on our<em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/lever-time-battle-to-end-dark-money/"><em>Lever Time</em></a></em> podcast, Whitehouse said that Democrats “have not blown the whistle” on the dark money corrupting our elections and the judiciary. He argued that Democrats could have — and should have — been spreading the message that “people you never see are spending billions of dollars to make sure you’re not heard.”</p>
<p>“We just didn’t,” he said. “We just couldn’t be bothered.”</p>
<p>Democrats no longer have full control of Congress, meaning they have once again missed their opportunity to end the scourge of dark money in politics. We hope that next time Democrats have the power to act, they actually do so.</p>
<p>To that end, Democratic lawmakers should read Whitehouse’s book — specifically the footnote that starts on page 132.</p>
