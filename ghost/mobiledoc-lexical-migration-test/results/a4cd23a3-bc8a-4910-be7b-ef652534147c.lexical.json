            "text": "Katt Williams is possibly one of the funniest and most underrated comedians to ever find a home on stage with a mic in their hand. Combining his extravagant nature with the flamboyant lifestyle of hip/hop, he created a character that had audiences rolling for decades. One of the most iconic aspects of that style has always been unique custom cars that show off the driver's wealth and status. Typically, these vehicles are called lowriders, but that is certainly not the only sort of car capable of presenting the \"baller\" life. Mr. Williams has recently acquired a vehicle that proves that trucks can be just as baroque.",

Powering this enormous beast is apparently a 3.0-liter eco diesel V6 engine that has a strong focus on low-end torque figures. Essentially, the truck is built for towing and offroading which it does exceptionally well with 600 ft/lbs of torque. With that in mind, it's a hilarious thought to imagine the 5' 5\" comedian bouncing up and down in his massive kevlar-coated turbo-diesel truck as he transverses rough terrain. This performance is impressive, but what makes it unique from other Apocalypse vehicles? ",
