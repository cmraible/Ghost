          "On Wednesday, President Joe Biden made headlines supporting Amazon workers trying to unionize and declaring, “Amazon, here we come.” But after Amazon-linked campaign cash has flooded into Democratic coffers, the president has refused to follow his own labor task force’s limited unionization recommendations, and he has failed to reinstate an Obama-era rule requiring companies like Amazon to disclose all of their union-busting spending. Such disclosures could help expose the anti-labor tactics of major law firms — including those that previously employed a key member of Biden’s labor task force."
