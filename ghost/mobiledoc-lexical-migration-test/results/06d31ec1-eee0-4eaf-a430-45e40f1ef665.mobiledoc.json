Inside, a stunning Turquoise interior is beautifully accented with wood trim and the seats appear to still be in their original packaging. Under the hood is what appears to be a well-maintained 500-cid engine that's appearance once again supports the ultra low mileage claim. It is unclear why someone would buy such a luxurious car to not drive it but regardless this car is in incredible condition and would make the perfect addition to the Cadillac enthusiasts collection or it could be used as a daily driver."
