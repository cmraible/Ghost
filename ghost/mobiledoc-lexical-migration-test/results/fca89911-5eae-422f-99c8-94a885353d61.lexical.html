<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As my metro area went up in flames last week, I’ve been in the media talking about why journalists must stop being nice and start holding climate villains accountable. And so I’m writing with a specific request: </p>
<p><strong>Can you please <a href="__GHOST_URL__/4-99monthly"><strong>click here</strong></a> and use this special discount to subscribe to <em>The Daily Poster</em> to help us hire reporters to hold Big Oil and their political puppets accountable?</strong></p>

<p><strong>You also immediately get access to a replay of our recent <em>Don’t Look Up</em> live chat with Adam McKay.</strong></p>
<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> has already done a ton of climate reporting exposing how politicians in both parties are helping their fossil fuel donors make this existential crisis worse. Our goal is to significantly expand that reporting as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>As a reader-supported news outlet, the only way we can do that is if you <a href="__GHOST_URL__/4-99monthly"><strong>click here</strong></a> and subscribe right now.</strong></p>
<p>Today, politicians can get themselves bankrolled by fossil fuel donors, pass policies making the climate crisis worse — and know that they will face almost no media scrutiny at all. We have to change that dynamic ASAP — and with your help, I’m confident <em>The Daily Poster</em> can help do that.</p>

<p>Thanks for considering this request — I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
