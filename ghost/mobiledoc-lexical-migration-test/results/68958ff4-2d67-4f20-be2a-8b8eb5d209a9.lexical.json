And, by “cluetrain”, I mean [Cluetrain Manifesto](http://cluetrain.com), of course.\n\n(I find the Cluetrain Manifesto to be a useful bozo test – if the “digital expert” or “social media guru” you’re talking to has never heard of it, there’s a fair chance they’re a bozo.)\n\nWell, Cluetrain is *back*.\n\n\n## New Clues\n\nTwo of the original authors of the Manifesto, [Doc Searls](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2015/01/08/cluetrain-rides-again/) and [David Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2015/01/08/new-clues/), have written [New Clues](http://cluetrain.com/newclues/) – some new clues for today’s internet. And some of it is just biting:\n\n> 60 – Ads that sound human but come from your marketing department’s irritable bowels, stain the fabric of the Web.\n> \n>  61 – When personalizing something is creepy, it’s a pretty good indication that you don’t understand what it means to be a person.\n\nIt’s well worth taking the time to read in full. And I suspect I’ll be doing “Clues of the day” here for a little while…\n\n*[Image by Loco Steve](https://www.flickr.com/photos/locosteve/4467347340/), and used under a Creative Commons licence*\n\n\n"
