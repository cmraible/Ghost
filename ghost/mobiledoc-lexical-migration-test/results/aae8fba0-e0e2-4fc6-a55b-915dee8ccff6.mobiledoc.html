<h3 id="just-101-of-these-special-edition-cars-were-built-and-sold-exclusively-through-the-neiman-marcus-christmas-catalog">Just 101 of these special edition cars were built and sold exclusively through the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog.</h3>
<p>The Cadillac XLR was a real show of force from the historic American marque. Designed and engineered with parent company General Motors’ resources behind it, this model was to take on the dominant Mercedes-Benz SL500. However, if you wanted your XLR to be even more special, you might have ordered one of 101 Neiman Marcus <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/neiman-marcus-special/">special edition cars</a>.</p>
<p>Set to go under the hammer at <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/as19/auburn-spring/lots/r0164-2004-cadillac-xlr-neiman-marcus-edition/773787" rel="noopener">RM Sotheby’s Auburn spring sale</a>, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/special-edition-cars/">limited edition car</a> could only be ordered from the Neiman Marcus luxury catalogue. The first 101 examples of this convertible were exclusively available via the Christmas shopping book, with the NM XLR Edition sold out in just 14 minutes!</p>

<p>Every XLR is based on the Chevrolet Corvette C6 platform and wields a 320-horsepower 4.6-liter Northstar V8 engine, but the Neiman Marcus received a few unique options. Aside from being amongst the first to get the keys to Cadillac’s latest model, the 101 cars also possessed special Ultra Violet paint, bespoke interior trim, and a numbered identification plate. Each NM XLR Edition cost $85,000 when new, with 99 quickly finding homes and the other two being donated to charity.</p>
<p>This 2004 Cadillac XLR Neiman Marcus Edition appears to be in excellent condition, despite previously branded as a Salvage Vehicle. The necessary repairs were made and the car is now attached to a Rebuilt Vehicle title.</p>

<p>The retractable metal top is certainly an alluring feature of this car, giving occupants greater refinement at higher speeds and a bit more insulation during the winter months. Despite the added weight of this mechanism, Cadillac worked hard to prevent the sports car from becoming too heavy. In fact, the XLR undercuts the kerb weight of an SL500 by some 180kg thanks to a lightweight body.</p>
<p>The interior is opulent with cream leathers and wood finishes lining the passenger space. Cosseting passenger seats and a five-speed automatic transmission should make for a great long-distance cruiser — one that isn’t short on character. A light bit of restoration would see the cabin returned to as-new condition, ready to be enjoyed this summer.</p>
<p>The car will hit the auction block on June 1, 2019 with an estimate of $30,000 - $40,000.</p>
