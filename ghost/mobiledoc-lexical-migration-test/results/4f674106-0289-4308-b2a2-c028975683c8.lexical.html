<p>On Tuesday 11/30 at 7 pm ET (4 pm PT), <em>Daily Poster</em> subscribers will speak with the stars of <em>MELTDOWN, </em>Sirota’s new hit podcast series that explores how the 2008 financial crisis and the Obama administration’s tepid response to it helped create the conditions for the rise of Donald Trump, and how Democrats risk repeating the same history today. </p>
<p><strong>Like all our live chats, the event is exclusively for <em>Daily Poster</em> paying subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcast live, ask questions in real time, and watch a replay of the event. </strong></p>
<p>Sirota will be joined by a series of guests featured prominently in the podcast series: Brad Miller, former Democratic Congressman from North Carolina; John Nichols, correspondent for <em>The Nation</em>; Neil Barofsky, former inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program; and Lisa Epstein, a nurse turned mortgage industry whistleblower.</p>
<p>Note that during the live event, Sirota and his guests will be discussing the 8-part podcast series, not listening to it. You can find the <a href="https://adbl.co/meltdown">entire <em>MELTDOWN</em> series here</a>. Audible offers a free 30-day subscription, which you can use to listen to the <strong>entire series for free</strong>.</p>
<p>To further prepare for the discussion, please feel free to read the following articles on the series: “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/democrats-fdr-new-deal-financial-crisis-1248615/">Democrats’ Betrayals Are Jeopardizing American Democracy</a>” and “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/28/financial-crisis-2009-meltdown-joe-biden-democrats">The 2009 Financial Crisis Taught Us Hard Lessons. Have Democrats Learned Them?</a>”</p>
