<p>It's already been three years since the current <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford/GT">Ford GT</a> was introduced, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Ford">Ford</a> is planning just three more model years for this supercar before  wrapping up production. For those who have yet to snatch one up yet, the  wait is most certainly worth the wait. Not only is the 2020 Ford GT  getting numerous improvement that will make this supercar even faster on  the track, there are also new appearance upgrades in store for this car  as well.</p>

<p>The biggest news for 2020 is that Ford has managed to squeeze an  extra 13 horsepower from its 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 to bring the GT's  power output up to an even 660 hp. On top of this boost in power, the  engine has also been given a broader torque curve and revised  calibration, while upgraded internals include new pistons and ignition  system. Finishing off the performance upgrades, Ford has also improved  engine cooling through redesigned air intakes and larger intercooler as  well as a premium Akrapovič titanium exhaust now standard, which helps  shave nine pounds from the curb weight.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news for the 2020 GT, though, is the addition of a  new Liquid Carbon Edition. This option strips the GT of its paint  resulting in a gorgeous bare carbon fiber body and carbon fiber wheels,  and customers have optional features like titanium lug nuts, six-point  racing harness anchors and five caliper colors. Ford has also given the  available Gulf Racing livery paint job subtle tweaks with black lines to  separate the colors and a switch from the no. 9 to the no. 6 for the  optional carbon fiber number that can be added to the hood and doors.  The no. 6, of course, pays homage to the two-time Le Mans winning GT40  chassis no. 1075.</p>
<p>Even with these upgrades, Ford is still planning on ending production of this generation GT in 2022.</p>
