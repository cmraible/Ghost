It adds a whole new layer of intrigue and while the cliche of solving problems with the power of friendship is still heavily relied upon, those that don’t get enough friendship attention can end up being brutally murdered infront of the character’s very eyes. There is roughly 40 hours of gameplay per playthrough as well with four different endings in total, so there is plenty of story to get through, although players will repeat much of it within the early game."
