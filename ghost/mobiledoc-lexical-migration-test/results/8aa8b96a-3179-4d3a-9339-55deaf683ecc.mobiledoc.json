So, off we went.\n\nI used to like Bluewater. I used to think it was a cut above other British shopping centres (which it still is), but then two things happened. First of all, it became more of a hang-out for chavs (for want of a better phrase), with the [cinema](http://www.showcasecinemas.co.uk/pages/bluewater.phtml) in particular suffering badly from this. And second, I visited a real American mall, the [Galleria](http://www.galleriamall-fl.com/) in Fort Lauderdale, and now I know I see Bluewater for the pale imitation it is.\n\nStill, it has an [Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/bluewater), so the day wasnâ€™t entirely wasted.\n\n\n"
