Arnold was a known car thief and criminal in the area, but the Chevelle is still missing."

The owner of the picture Monte Carlo, Garrett Alexander Reed, was fortunate enough to get the car back two months later, in seemingly unharmed condition. "

Stolen from the Austin Hatcher Foundation’s Education Advancement Center's secured warehouse, the two custom vehicles were found in the woods, stripped of most of their pricey parts - the vehicles were also significantly damaged during the parts chopping. To salt the wound, these special SUVs were designed and built by pediatric cancer patients and their families as part of the foundation's therapy and recovery program, and were set to be auctioned off before the thefts - proving there is no limit on how crummy a criminal can be."
