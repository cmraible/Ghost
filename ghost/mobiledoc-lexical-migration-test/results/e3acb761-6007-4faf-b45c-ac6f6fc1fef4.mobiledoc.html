<p>Adding further to the desirability of these muscle cars is they’re all slightly different from each other, thanks to Oldsmobile not only including the Hurst conversion package one each one but also allowing buyers to add any parts from the Cutlass 442.</p>

<p>As you can see from the pictures, this <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/hurst-olds?promo=MOTORIOUS10">’69 Hurst/Olds</a> is absolutely stunning. That’s thanks to a no-expenses-spared frame-off restoration. Each and every part of this car has been gone over in fine detail. Plus, a fresh application of Cameo White and Hurst Gold with hand-painted black pinstripes add to its authenticity. This concours-level restoration even includes a black grille, dual racing mirrors, factory badges, and the fiberglass hood with functional scoops.</p>

<p>About that ram air hood, the scoops feed an original, numbers-matching W-46 high-output 455ci V8 with 380-horsepower and 500 lb.-ft. of torque. The engine bay is perfect for showing off at the most competitive events. There’s also a Turbo 400 automatic transmission with a Hurst shifter. A Positraction 3.23 rear helps put that power to the road for plenty of get-up-and-go.</p>
