What’s also amazing is it pulls in some styling cues from the rat rods, while also mixing in some cleverly-hidden comforts. This is the kind of vehicle you could enter into the "

          "First, the looks. It’s obvious someone really thought out the design of this street rod. That low-slung look is achieved by channeling the cab over the frame and running the suspension through the bed, which is hidden when you open the cover. Matte gray paint gives a little bit of an industrial vibe, while the red insert in the factory grille, plus matching pinstriping and flames inject some chaotic fun. Really switching things up are the lime green wheels, the same color used to outline the flames. A minimalist approach means the interior matches the vibe of the rest of the truck. This professional build was only completed in the last two months, so everything is extremely fresh."

Among the details are Indy heads, Lunati Voodoo camshaft, Edelbrock intake, Indy headers, and a 4bbl Holley carb. A five-speed manual transmission backs that, sending power to the Ford 9-inch rear. You’ll also spot the Champion aluminum radiator with electric fan, MSD ignition, and Wilwood brakes."

If you have a keen eye for detail you might have spotted some, like the padded vinyl roof and bed cover, carpeted bed, and exposed roof insulation which looks like a fashion statement. While the aluminum door panels have pulls which look like window cranks, the power switches are hidden in the center console so nobody needs to know you’re living it up."
