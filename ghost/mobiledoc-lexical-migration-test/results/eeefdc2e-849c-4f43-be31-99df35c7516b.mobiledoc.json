          "It was last December when I was browsing online portfolios and gathering referrals to do one thing I never thought I’d do: hire someone else to detail my car. Since I bought my first car at 17, the Navy Blue Metallic Firebird Formula I still have, I’ve been detailing my own car. Actually, when my son was a baby, I’d let him roll around in his baby walker toy in the driveway while I spent hours buffing and cleaning - if I wanted the car I raced on the weekends to stay in show shape, I had to do it, plus it was therapeutic."

I am the kind of person who hasn’t had great luck with service, I’m not a complainer, but the window tint guy my friends raved over left bubbles in the tint, the alignment shop everyone told me to go to for my lowered car took off some paint on the lip, and so on. Having bad experiences with your cars, when you love them so much, will leave you pretty sheepish, and I wasn’t going to mess around."

Let me stop here and say that I am not being paid, nor is anyone at Motorious to endorse this company, nor are we specifically endorsing the business. I paid full price for the detailing of both of my vehicles, and later one the ceramic service of the Hellcat."

Joe breaks down why it looked better than sitting on the showroom floor, as well as answering some of our questions about weird things he’s had to clean up, and tips for at-home detailing in this special episode of the Motorious Podcast."
