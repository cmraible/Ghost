<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at Soda Den's <em>Roots of Pacha</em>. The game is slated to release in April 2022 on Windows PC (via Steam) and Nintendo Switch, followed up by releases on Mac OS & Linux (via Steam), PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Here's the overview:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Roots of Pacha </strong>is a co-op farming and life simulation game set in the stone age. Help your once nomadic clan settle in a promised and fertile land. By connecting with nature you’ll develop <em><strong>Ideas</strong></em> to evolve, enrich your culture, relationships, and discover the mysteries of Pacha, mother nature.<br><br>Roots of Pacha is first and foremost a farming sim. But that doesn't mean it has a seed or animal shop. Part of settling means exploring the wildlands to discover new plants and improving them, making wild variants more nutritious and valuable.<br><br>By adding to the Clan's seed storage and gaining knowledge about plants, you'll also discover new, more domesticated varieties.<br><br>Throughout the world and seasons, you'll encounter families of animals, which at first appear to ignore you. By slowly approaching and enticing them, you'll befriend them and even invite them to live with you. Animals are a core part of Roots of Pacha as they have also been in our human history: sources of nourishment, protection, and friendship.<br><br>Caring for your furry and feathery Clan members will eventually let them breed and evolve into new species.<br><br>Start fishing the shallow waters, ankle deep, waiting for the fish to come near you for the right moment to catch them. As you evolve, you'll invent new tools and techniques for fishing to reach deeper waters with larger fish.<br><br>Venture deep, through the cracks of the world to find resources needed to evolve and also encounter the spiritual world. Will you accept the challenges of the Wise Owl Totem? Solve puzzles to gain access to their powers and reach places hidden in the world.<br><br>Share your adventure with baby animals you’ll find around the world that just don’t grow any larger!</blockquote>
