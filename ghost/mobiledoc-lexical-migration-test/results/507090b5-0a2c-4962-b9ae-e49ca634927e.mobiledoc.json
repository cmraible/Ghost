He apparently had others, including a 1911, but the media really focused in on the scary weapon used by socialist revolutionaries to topple free governments around the globe. Also, we know from personal experience many guns are mistakenly called AK-47s by other journalists who don’t know the difference between a communist and capitalist weapon, but apparently this info is from CHP so maybe it’s accurate?"
