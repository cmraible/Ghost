          " has been on a bit of a kick recently about buying incredibly high-value classic cars and all sorts of other expensive automobiles. At first, the whole idea started around building a car show, and dare I say a community of enthusiasts. Nowadays, it's expanding Beyond anyone's wildest dreams with hundreds of cars in the Rick Ross collection, most of which are unlike any scene in normal shows throughout the country. The artist and car Enthusiast entrepreneur has been looking into purchasing a new car, but it might not be exactly what you expect."

Mr. Ross is no novice when it comes to acquiring high-level vehicles but Bugatti has always been sort of a major goal for anyone looking to make it big. Needless to say, Ross has certainly done that and now has acquired a bit of a taste for one special-looking black and white Bugatti Chiron."

          "Being a larger gentleman, Mr. Ross questioned the employee initially as to whether or not he would be able to fit in the vehicle. When asked about this, the man behind the counter quickly responded that he could get the keys and they would find out together. Luckily, he did fit in the driver's seat despite the vehicle sitting fairly low to the ground. Over the last few years, Bugatti has proven itself as more of a luxury brand than anything else, so Rick may fit in there quite comfortably. As the camera pans throughout the interior of the vehicle, the artist reflects on the incredible life, and career, that he's lived recanting how it was a major goal for him. Hopefully, this will mean that we all will get to see the black and white Bugatti added to the collection, but only time will tell. "
