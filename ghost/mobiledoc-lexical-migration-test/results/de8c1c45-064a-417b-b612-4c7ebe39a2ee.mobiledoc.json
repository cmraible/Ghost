This is easy at first thanks to the computer holding your hand and telling you what to input, but what it doesn’t tell you is that your machine will get stuck on obstacles and you’ll constantly need to supervise them in the early part of the game. See, your robots need equipment to work, which means you’ll need to gather resources, craft them an item and then give them the item you’ve made. However, if it breaks (and it will) or if he gets stuck on a tree or in a hole, your robot will stop working immediately. I found myself doing most of the work myself as it takes time to sort out new equipment and continuously move your robot to a clear space somewhere so it won’t get stuck.
