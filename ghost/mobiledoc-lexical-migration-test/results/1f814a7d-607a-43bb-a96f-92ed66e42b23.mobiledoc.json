Bernie Sanders’ 2020 campaign, is working in concert with state lawmakers, labor unions, and issue-based organizations to build left power by training organizers and building consensus around popular policies, including public housing investments.

The state has no dedicated funding stream for affordable housing, and a shortage of homes has driven up prices in recent years."
