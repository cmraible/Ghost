<p>Some people want to impress everyone by pulling up in a supercar. Other guys are more into something that might not look fast, but then blows everyone away when it smokes rubber. This <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/168346/1968-chevrolet-nova-restomod">1968 Chevrolet Nova restomod</a> is a great sleeper. Unlike some modified Novas, it doesnâ€™t have a big blower protruding out of the hood or some crazy stance that almost mimics a Funny Car.</p>

<p>The big key to speed with this Nova is the massive 5.7-liter LS1 V8 sending plenty of horsepower and torque to those back wheels. Like any proper muscle car, restomodded or not, this Chevy uses a Borg Warner 6-speed manual transmission. Just mashing the accelerator and letting the computer have the fun of shifting really saps the fun out of these cars. Completing the setup is a hydraulic clutch and an 8.5 10-bolt rear. With great power comes great need to keep that power in check. Fortunately, Cal Trac bars combined with power rack-and-pinion steering, tubular control arms, QA1 coil over shocks, and power four-wheel disc brakes.</p>

<p>While not as smoking hot as that powertrain, the body on this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/baddest-novas-on-motorious/">Chevy Nova</a> is in great shape, making it an attractive sleeper. The seller claims there are zero signs of rust, and examining the photos that certainly appears to be true. Slathered on each panel is a lustrous Torch red paint that almost looks wet when the light hits it just so. This car rolls on 17-inch Billet Specialties wheels up front and 18-inchers in the rear.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get an awesome powertrain and exterior, but the interior leaves you feeling letdown. This car has a nice, all-new interior with bucket seats and center console. An American Muscle dash houses the decidedly modern gauge cluster and a modern sound system.</p>
<p>The Chevy Nova has been a popular car for engine swaps, thanks to its lightweight yet solid construction. Because they have a good reputation and the LS1 is a fantastic engine, this setup is a surefire hit with crowds. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Old+Toen+Automobiles">Old town Automobiles</a> is offering this Chevy Nova restomod to fulfill your need for speed.</p>
