<p>With the Miata celebrating its <a href="__GHOST_URL__/slideshow/features/304556/why-the-mazda-mx-5-miata-is-still-an-icon-30-years-on">30th birthday this year</a>, prices have been on the rise for original first generation cars for some time now. Gone are the days of being able to pick up clean cars for a handful of notes, sadly, and the prices seem to be continuing on this upward trend.</p>
<p>Not only are values becoming slightly concerning for the budget conscious amongst us, but Mazda has even unveiled a restoration program. Yeah, like how Aston Martin and JLR take back any car of their past and will rebuild it, it’s just that this is a Mazda. Go figure.</p>

<p>Although prices may not be heading towards XKE territory yet, perhaps it’s time to shift our sights to another generation of Miata. A generation without popup headlights, even. Perhaps in the form of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/163587/2003-mazda-mx-5-miata-2dr-conv-cloth-5-spd-manual">this</a> 2003 example, offered by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Skyway+Classics">Skyway Classics</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the second generation car losing its rocking lights, the chassis is exactly the same as the one you fell in love with, just without perhaps quite as much rust or such a leaky engine. The car featured here is a late second-generation model being a 2003, a whole 14 years younger than the first Miata’s - now that makes a difference.</p>

<p>Along with age being firmly on this second generation models side, it also benefits from the peppier 1.8-liter engine featuring variable valve timing. Finished in silver over black leather, the combination is classical, and barely suggests the 91,000 miles on the odometer.</p>
<p>If manual transmissions aren’t your thing then this really is the perfect example. Featuring a rare but smooth automatic transmission, you can get the best out of this epic little sports car without worrying about clutch control.</p>
<p>Could this be the youngest mass produced modern classic on our roads today?</p>
