<hr>
<p>Among the many cars which look like they should be fast but are really slow pieces of turd, the DeLorean is one of the prime examples out there. Thanks to the Back to the Future trilogy, most of the public thinks these 80s sports cars are pretty hot. In actuality the V6 engines not only propelled the thing from 0-60 in over 10 seconds, they’re known for being pretty unreliable. For the movie, the film crew did an engine swap on the stunt car, dropping in a Porsche V8 for that extra gusto.</p>

<p>What we have here is something even better: a DeLorean with a twin-turbo LSX swap. Sweetening the deal further, this build is a widebody to accommodate beefy rear tires. As you’ll see in the video interview, the guy who built this car had to do a lot of trailblazing work to make it happen.</p>

<p>Does that mean he or someone else will start offering conversion kits? Probably not, unless there’s some tremendous untapped interest in doing this to many of the surviving DeLoreans. For the most part, people who own the cars like to keep them stock and get pretty angry at people who chop them up, so we’re guessing they’re not a fan of this guy at all.</p>
<p>The story is that the guy found the cheapest DeLorean for sale in the United States at the time, scooping it up for $11,500. The thing wasn’t pretty and had collision damage, so he wasn’t cutting apart a perfect car to make this creation. Also, someone painted it red to cover up the Bondo in the panels.</p>

<p>There are other cosmetic changes, like the crazy headlights and taillights, aero, etc. We don’t expect everyone to love all that, but we sure do love the more potent powertrain.</p>
<p>We’re definitely grateful for 1320video which shared this amazing build at the SEMA Show. Check it out for yourself.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r0MA2nd3EU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
