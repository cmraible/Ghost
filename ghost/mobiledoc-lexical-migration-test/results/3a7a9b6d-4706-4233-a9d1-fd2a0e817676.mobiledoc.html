That being said, this 1969 Ford Mustang convertible that just popped up on Bring a Trailer may be one of the rarest we’ve seen.</h3>

<p>According to the Marti Report, less than 6,000 <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1969-ford-cobrajet-428-converitible/">1969 Mustangs</a> featured a black power top with the rear glass, 276 were built with the  paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, and just 70 were <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1969-ford-cobrajet-428-converitible/">finished in Candyapple Red </a>with the aforementioned car’s trim package. This reportedly equates to just ten examples being produced with all of these features and this is one of them. Thanks to being used as a daily driver, the exterior has picked up some signs of wear in what is believed to be its 121,883-miles but the premium white interior has been well-preserved.</p>

<p>On top of having only changed hands once before and both owners being very open about the work performed to the car, this rare Mustang is well documented to be built how it came from the factory with the exception of some engine and drivetrain modifications. Despite this information, the comments on this car have sparked quite the debate over small seemingly insignificant aspects. With some going as far as to say that they’ve never seen anything like it.
