The zombies travel from the top of the table to the bottom as they try to attack you, all the while hiding beneath the flippers. Because of this, there are times when a massive hoard will be at the top with your ball, constantly ricocheting between them, but a few stragglers will make it past and wail on you while you’re desperately waiting for your ball to return so you can hit them, making you feel helpless at the whims of the pinball’s physics."

The ball slows down considerably when in contact with the flippers; I understand that this was included to help with more accurate shots to trigger some character skills but it’s pretty common for the zombies to run down the table faster than the ball rolling down the flipper, making the slowdown a little redundant and more of a hindrance."
