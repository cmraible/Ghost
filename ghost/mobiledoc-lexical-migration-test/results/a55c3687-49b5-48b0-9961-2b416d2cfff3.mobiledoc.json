With a price like that, one could reasonably expect greater performance from their brand new pony car and they’d be right but not in the way you’d think. The package comes with a stunning set of carbon fiber wheels and improves on the mustangs, already top tier, handling and "

The base mustang’s tires were designed with the idea that because this is a Pony Car, that their customers would most-likely be drag racing these cars if anything. With that thought in mind, they made a car that could conquer the drag strip while also being able to keep up in other kinds of racing and the customers with proficiency for track racing could opt for an endurance focused package if they felt the need to do so."

This is compared to the CFTP which has a 0-60 of 3.4-seconds, a 0-100 of 7.1-seconds, and a quarter-mile of 11.4-seconds however the car does also come with reduced weight, better handling, higher endurance tires, and some sweet aesthetic upgrades so it just comes down to what you're looking for in a car. Regardless of which you pick the GT500 is still an amazing car and a great choice for any kind of racing."
