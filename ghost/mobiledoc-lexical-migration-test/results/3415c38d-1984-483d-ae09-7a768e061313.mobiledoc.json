Because Shaq is 7’ 1'' tall and 325 lbs, the factory fuel tank was removed in favor of a font-mounted model. This allowed for better legroom and more even weight distribution. Overall, this, along with the Lamborghini Gallardo are both pretty wild options considering Shaq’s stature."

Under the hood is a Turbodeisle V8 engine putting out 300 horsepower which certainly isn't the fastest powerhouse on the road but still gets the job done. Finally, you have to admire the Charger Hellcat, a stark contrast to the aforementioned truck with 707 horsepower bursting from its 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8. Overall, Shaq has good taste when it comes to cars which is exactly what makes his collection special."
