These days, a classic vehicle that is running and driving is at least worth more than the several hundred dollars a scrap yard would pay for the vehicle, but instead of focusing on the money, Sportal focused on what the truck meant to Leenstra and sold the truck to him for just $75. Yes, 44 years after negotiating the sale with Leenstra's late grandfather, Sportal sold the truck back to his family for the same price. That wasn't exactly a wise financial decision, but it's a great story of paying it forward in the classic car community and, perhaps more importantly, keeping your wife happy."
