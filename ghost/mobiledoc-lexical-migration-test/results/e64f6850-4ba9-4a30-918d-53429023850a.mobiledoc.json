I'm trying to practice what I preach and iterate on how I do these, based on reader feedback and analytics. And I'm trying to find things that aren't the same old links that are in <em>every</em> media newsletter out there. It's edging towards the point where I can't tell some of them apart, and that's not a healthy ecosystem, is it?</p><p>Talking of which, there's two things I'm on the fence on writing about:</p><ul><li>The sale of <em>Quartz</em> — the fact that <em>everyone</em> has written about it is putting me off. I actually had an email the other day whose piece on <em>Quartz</em> was basically extracts from two other newsletters who wrote about <em>Quartz</em>, and I felt like I was in some sort of media newsletter Inception hell. I do feel I have a different and, moreover, useful take. But do we really need another one?</li><li>Facebook semi-accidentally driving the critics-led Real Facebook Oversight Board off the web.
