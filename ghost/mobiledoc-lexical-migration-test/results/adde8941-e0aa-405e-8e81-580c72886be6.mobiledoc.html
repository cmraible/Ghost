<p>Throughout its storied history, Porsche has produced a long list of impressive cars. Even with that solid reputation, people were floored when this <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20183&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">2018 Porsche GT2</a> RS was first revealed. With monstrous power and a dizzying array of advanced performance features, it’s set to carve up any road or track with extreme precision. What’s more, this car is more than just a fantasy since it’s headed for the auction block through <a href="https://vicariauction.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Vicari Auction</a>.</p>

<p>With a 3.8-liter twin-turbo flat-6 engine pushing an earth-shattering 700-horsepower, this car moves you in a hurry. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission ensures gear transitions happen at lightning-quick speeds and with exacting precision. That leaves your hands free to grip the steering wheel while guiding this performance monster through turns with absolute ferocity.</p>
<p>Since this car comes with the optional Weissach package, <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20183&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the 911 GT2 RS</a> shaves a precious 40 pounds through means like magnesium wheels and additional carbon-fiber components. That means this ride tips the scale at just over 3,200 pounds, making the aero components necessary to keep it glued to the track at higher speeds.</p>
