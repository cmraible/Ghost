<p>Monday's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/07/facebook-is-an-accelerator-of-our-toxic-times-not-its-cause/">piece on Facebook</a> got some interesting responses. It was one of those pieces that was well-read, but not well-shared, which is can be a sign of many things: people disagree with it; people agree, but don't feel it should be shared; it has a good premise but is rubbish and so on.</p>
<p>I miss the old days when the comments section made that easy to figure out… </p>
<p>However, there was at least some pushback, and I think this was a good articulation of the basic challenge to my piece:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the information age, I see Facebook as an arms dealer. The defence of, "If we didn't develop these tools that allow the accurate dissemination of misinformation to a highly targeted audience then someone else surely would have," doesn't hold much sway with me.</p>— Stef (@st3f) <a href="https://twitter.com/st3f/status/1280232943588380673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a>
    </blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure>
<p>I don't disagree. If anything, I'd say that my argument was as simple as "closing down the arms dealer won't, in of itself, stop the war".</p>
<p>That doesn't mean, of course, that we shouldn't look askance at people profiting from stoking culture wars, and <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2020/07/08/why-facebook-advertising-boycott-different?utm_campaign=Newsletter_Daily_EuropePM&utm_source=pardot&utm_medium=email">making money from hate</a>. As I said in my original piece, I wasn't defending Facebook, merely trying to remind people that there's more to the problem than just the social network itself. </p>
<p>And if I had a solution to stopping that war, well, I probably wouldn't be sitting here writing this, would I?</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-heat-out-of-online-conflict">Taking the heat out of online conflict</h3>
<p>That said, there are some interesting solutions in active development to some of the problems . Use of machine learning to spot and highlight problematic posts looks like a promising way forwards. For example:</p>

        <div class="kg-bookmark-content">

    </a></figure>
<p>LOLA, as the system is named, can analyse around 25,000 texts per minute. And some of the findings are interesting:</p>
<blockquote>In a recent use-case on fake news about Covid-19, LOLA found that this misinformation has strong components of fear and anger. This tells us that fear and anger are helping disseminate the fake news. Predictably, emotive language motivates people to pass on information, before giving it a second thought. For LOLA, it is straightforward to pinpoint the originators of the misinformation. In this way, we can reduce online harms.</blockquote>
<p>There are some bold claims right there, but certainly using machine learning to support and direct human intervention could be one way of start to restore civility to online discourse. </p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://memex.naughtons.org/monday-6-july-2020/30465/">John Naughton flagged up an interesting piece</a> from last year that flew under my radar:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/let-juries-review-facebook-ads/601996/">
        <div class="kg-bookmark-content">
            <div class="kg-bookmark-title">A Jury of Random People Can Do Wonders for Facebook</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-description">No one, including the social-media giant itself, trusts the company to decide which ads are false. But somebody has to render judgment.</div>
            <div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/a/theatlantic/img/lacroix/apple-touch-icon-ipad-retina.398a2c61e146.png" alt><span class="kg-bookmark-author">The Atlantic</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Jonathan Zittrain</span></div>
        </div>
        <div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_LKZ12UQ1uMs2PdLmHo2AiFD8TQ=/5x0:3499x1820/960x500/media/img/mt/2019/11/RTX12SBA/original.jpg" alt></div>
    </a></figure>
<p>Juries are a remarkably good system for addressing complex issues. As John put it:</p>
<blockquote>I was once a juror on a really serious criminal case and I was blown away by the way in which a group of twelve ‘ordinary’ people was able to sort through a maze of contradictory and flawed evidence and patiently and thoroughly come to a decision. And then to discover afterwards that it was exactly the correct conclusion, because the previous criminal record of the accused had — of course — not been disclosed to us.</blockquote>
<p>Charles Arthur <a href="https://theoverspill.blog/2020/07/07/facebook-twitter-hongkong-requests-start-up-1346/#c1fcb22bb37b85c5f4b1e368ad6d33ad">picked up on the theme</a>: </p>
<blockquote>There would be tons and tons and tons of ads, so I guess people would have to be instantly co-opted into juries to make decisions</blockquote>
<p>However, I can't help thinking about the other area of Facebook where the public are co-opted to review things: the places information. The area I live — Shoreham Beach — keeps moving, and people vote for it to be in the US, Australia or the UK. If Facebook can't build a system that reliably allows three places with the same name to exist, I'm not sure they can build a jury system that can cope with political nuance… </p>
<p>I suspect that any solution that works at scale will require an intelligent mix of automated machine learning systems and human intervention in the most difficult cases. And if that accelerates the journey from abusive behaviour to consequences, all the better. </p>
