<p>There's a rather odd wee theory circulating called the <em>Dead Internet Theory</em>, which more-or-less posits that the human internet has been largely replaced by algorithmically-generated, commerical content. It's <em>not true</em>, but it feels true, as this piece explores:</p>
<blockquote>When we are engaging on the web, we don’t feel engaged anymore. The clicks and swipes no longer <em>spark joy</em> (as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AvWs2X-bEA" rel>Marie Kondo might say</a>). We feel force-fed, manipulated, unfulfilled.</blockquote>
<p>I supect that, much like the “social media is dead” idea we looked at yesterday, that this just marks a weariness with the attention-driven metrics of the big platforms. The <em>interesting</em> stuff is happening in newsletters, blogs and other platforms. We're riding the roller-coaster from big to small again. </p>
