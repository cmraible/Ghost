Although, when you look at it against the contemporary vehicle designs, which were blocky and angular, and you keep in mind this was a concept car and not a production model, it’s not as bad.

The side windows are an obvious thing to note, but the more subtle one-inch-wider track and 5.6-inch-shorter wheelbase made a larger impact on the performance characteristics of the concept. Since it was shorter, the rear seats had to be ditched, and at least that cut down the curb weight some. Plus, who’s riding in the backseat of a rally racer? The concept also had a taller ride height, a necessary change for rolling over obstacles on an off-road stage for European rally races."

At least it had a four-speed manual transmission, but the suspension was just the stock setup from the production Mustang, so it wouldn’t have handled aggressive driving well at all. However, the 16-inch wheels with Pirelli P7 tires were a nice upgrade."

Thickly-padded leather bucket seats with red trim would definitely keep the driver and navigator from feeling stiff, even after hours of wheeling. The steering wheel hub was even padded and had leather upholstery – how about that? In true rally-car style, the shifter was located at the bottom of the center stack, making the driver’s right-hand movements shorter and thus quicker."
