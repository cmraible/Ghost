As if the standard 442 didn't already offer enthusiasts enough performance, the W-30 delivered even more power and represented the high-water mark for performance from GM's Oldsmobile brand. The 1970 442 W-30 was a limited-production model with less than 300 convertibles being made, and this white-on-blue convertible will be up for grabs next month through "

The result of these modifications was a minor bump in power output over a base 442 with the W-30 models rated at 370 horsepower. This convertible is equipped with the Turbo 400 automatic transmission making it just one of 168 1970 Oldsmobile 442 W-30 convertibles built that year; another 96 were equipped with a four-speed manual gearbox."

Not only is it in excellent shape, but it also has detailed documentation that dates back to when it was new.  This car shows extremely well with its beautiful blue paint job accented by the bright chrome, white hood stripes, white convertible soft top and the Magnum wheels. The interior of this W-30 is just as nice with white bucket seats up front separated by a center console, and this car even has the Hurst Dual Gate Shifter for a manual-driving experience."
