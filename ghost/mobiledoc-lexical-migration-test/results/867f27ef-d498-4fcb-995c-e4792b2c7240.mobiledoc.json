Still, as you can clearly see with this C10, it wasn’t a bad year for Chevrolet styling. This flareside truck looks tough with a short bed, squared-off lines, and a no-fuss attitude. The silver paint is perfect for showing all this off without pretense."

The period-style radio helps with the effect of a factory setup. You also get to enjoy air conditioning in the cab, making for greater comfort on a hot summer day."
