          "With major classic car auctions underway this week in Arizona, some classic car buyers and sellers might be a little on edge about the reports of stolen collectibles, especially from the out of towner folks. If you do get your car stolen during auction week, there is some hope it might be recovered, as one Phoenix man’s 1968 Chevy Camaro actually did turn back up after it got swiped from the owner’s apartment garage."

He has provided the police with videos and photos of the person believed to have stolen the Camaro. A man with a big yellow backpack is said to be pictured, who stopped to talk to a construction crew right before swiping the car."

At the very least, the ignition was damaged when the thief rammed something in it to get the Camaro to start. This is a rare story of recovery, please know these people, even this particular crook, is out there eyeballing your car right now."
