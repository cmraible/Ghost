In the capture, he apparently claimed the Model S “flats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time.” The Tesla in the pool looks like it might be a Model 3, maybe a Model Y, but we’re pretty sure it isn’t a Model S. Still, the person who posted a screen capture of Musk’s tweet was wondering if the driver/owner of the Tesla in the pool has some sort of truth in advertising claim. We’re not attorneys, so we can’t comment on the legal viability of such a thing, but as car enthusiasts we find the Musk claim and this possibility equally ridiculous.",
