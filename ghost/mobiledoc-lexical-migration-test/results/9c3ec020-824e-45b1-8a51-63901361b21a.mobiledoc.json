That’s what’s so great about sleepers like this multi-colored 1973 Chevy C10. Yes, there’s a nice layer of rust on the square body’s front bumper and other obvious imperfections, but what’s under the skin counts most."

For starters, the huge intercooler visible through the factory grille indicates aggressive forced induction. Peeking between the spokes on the front 20-inch wheels are slotted and cross-drilled rotors, something you wouldn’t expect to see on this kind of ride. While it doesn’t absolutely mean this is a performance ride, the lowered stance is another slight tip."

A turbocharged, high-powered truck might seem like an odd choice, but performance nuts often can’t just leave anything with wheels alone."
