Under the hood is the factory 289ci V8 equipped with a factory Paxton SN90 supercharger. This engine was rated at 289 horsepower at 4860 pm. Things look much brighter on the GTOâ€™s side with it sporting the infamous 400 cubic-inch V8 and a higher compression ratio, 10.75-1 vs 9.0-1. That massive powerhouse was capable of pushing out 366 horsepower at 5100 RPM. Another bit that may end up securing the win in the GTO's favor is the presence of a stuffed tiger in the back seat, unfortunately, this is not a stock component so we won't include it on the list.",

It is also worth noting that factory horsepower ratings in that time were notoriously incorrect as they did not cover the full rev-range of the vehicle, this means that the Studebaker may have more power than factory spec tells us. As round two comes around we see the GTO pick up some speed and take the lead, however, this was short-lived as the Studebaker quickly caught up and won round two. In the final round, both drivers begin to pick up speed but the Studebaker takes the win and even breaks into the 13-second range. So there you have it, straight from the horse's mouth, the Studebaker is the faster classic.",
