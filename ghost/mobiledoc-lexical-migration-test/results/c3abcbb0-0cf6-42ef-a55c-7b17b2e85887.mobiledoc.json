For starters, unlike the Model A and Model T, the Model B offered a V8 engine making it instantly popular among racers and customizers. Aside from that, the 1932 was a one-year-only design with 14 different bodies, and the most unique part of these cars is that the exposed frame was actually part of the overall styling. Foose points that no other car has ever done and only performance motorcycles have done since."

It's hard to complain about the looks of any '32 Ford hotrod, but Foose favors the five-window due to the door size and just-right body proportions. Despite his preference toward the looks of the five-window body, he draws a couple takes on the roadster including cartoonishly cool picture as well as look at what made Boyd Coddington's Boydster so ground breaking."
