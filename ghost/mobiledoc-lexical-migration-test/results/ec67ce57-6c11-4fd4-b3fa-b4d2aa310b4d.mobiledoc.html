<p>After three years and 4,500 hours of work, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-pontiac-firebird/">1968 Pontiac Firebird</a> was transformed into a far more potent and drop-dead gorgeous restomod. Heading to the auction block <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/top-10-no-reserve-cars-at-gaa/">at no reserve</a> as part of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barrett-jackson-returns-live-auctions/">2020 Barrett-Jackson Fall Auction in Scottsdale</a>, this muscle car is sure to make a splash. It combines good looks and potent modern performance, plus even some luxuries, making for an excellent representation of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tyler-hoover-sings-praises-for-restomods/">what a restomod should be</a>.</p>

<p>At the heart of this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> is an LS3 tuned to push out somewhere north of 550-horsepower. To reach that lofty output, a host of upgrades had to be installed, including upgraded pistons, connecting rods, and a more aggressive camshaft. That 6.2-liter V8 is enough to make anyone’s day far brighter and ensure you’re good friends with a local tire shop.</p>
<p>A good engine needs something just as solid backing it up, and that’s where the GM 6L90 6-speed automatic with 3.73:1 gears comes in. Yes, we’re fans of handmade shifts, but if you’re going to let the transmission do all the shifting you should at least get something as good as this. A 12-bolt rear end finishes things properly.</p>

<p>This Firebird screams with the best of them, thanks to a pair of ceramic-coated Sanderson headers. Those connect to a custom exhaust to do this setup justice when you turn the key.</p>
<p>Power is great, but keeping a car going in the right direction is even better. A modernized chassis includes Detroit Speed coilovers, QUADRALink rear suspension, plus a fully revised tubular front suspension. Subframe connectors help provide the kind of torsional rigidity necessary to keep this Pontiac handling tight. Baer disc brakes at all four corners help with superior stopping performance.</p>

<p>Everyone notices that beautiful Viva La Red, a formula developed by PPG to really captivate the eye. A redesigned front fascia, shaved door handles and drip rails, plus custom rear decklid spoiler and front splitter punch things up several more notches.</p>

<p>That’s enough to have most people sold, but the builder didn’t stop there. A completely custom interior includes bucket seats donated by a 2006 Pontiac GTO with Douglass European leather upholstery and the classic Firebird logo embroidered into each one. A center console, infotainment system, AC, and more make this a space where you won’t suffer one bit.</p>
