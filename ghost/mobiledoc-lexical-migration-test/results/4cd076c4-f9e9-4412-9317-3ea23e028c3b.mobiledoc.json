This might be in the form of higher prices, fewer services, shorter operating hours, etc. While an insurance policy might cover some of the stolen items, too many claims from a business will increase their premium payments. That increase is also passed along to consumers. So, in the end we all end up paying the price for thieves’ crimes, quite literally."
