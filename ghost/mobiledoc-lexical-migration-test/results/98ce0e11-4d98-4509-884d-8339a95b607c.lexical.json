It reportedly took a couple of months to complete the customizations. Having the muscle car at the dealership generated a lot of online buzz and Mike Monicatti says people showed up just to get their picture taken with it. The fact the muscle car was then swindled away through apparently fraudulent means is heartbreaking.",
