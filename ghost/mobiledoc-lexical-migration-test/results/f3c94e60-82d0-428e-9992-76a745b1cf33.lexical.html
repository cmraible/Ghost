<p>To celebrate Collector Car Appreciation, Motorious is holding a Digital Happy Hour this Friday, July 10 from 5-6 pm EST. Everyone is invited to join the discussion about collector cars of every kind, which will be broadcast on Zoom, per-register <a href=" https://us04web.zoom.us/j/75640632477">here</a>. </p>
<p>As the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thefts-are-becoming-more-common-during-lockdown/">coronavirus lockdowns</a> are lifting in certain areas and car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/instead-of-a-vacation/">enthusiasts</a> are looking to socialize once more, everyone should keep in mind the upcoming Collector Car Appreciation Day being organized by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1983-chevrolet-c30-camper-sema-show-truck/">SEMA</a>, the Automotive Restoration Market Organization, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/hotrods/">Hot Rod</a> Industry Alliance. Set for July 10, 2020, this will be the 11<sup>th</sup> annual celebration of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-restored-cars-on-motorious/">automotive restoration</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/300-car-collection/">collecting</a>. In other words, you should start figuring out how you want to observe this important date.</p>
<p>Officially, the date of the 2020 Collector Car Appreciation Day was announced back on December 19, 2019. However, considering the past few months have felt like a few years of chaos for many, you’re completely forgiven for not remembering.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day. Different automotive-related businesses will be doing “holiday sales,” people will be out driving their collector cars, and a whole range of gatherings will be held.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-1970-challenger/">SEMA</a> has been compiling a list of all the events set for July, including virtual gatherings. They’re scattered all over the country, from Philmont, New York to Escondido, California. See the entire list <a href="https://www.semasan.com/collector-car-appreciation-day/2020-events">here</a>.

<p>While we here at Motorious certainly love cool cars and preserving them, as well as amazing collections, it’s also important to focus on the economic impact this hobby has. Many high-skilled jobs are funded by car enthusiasts seeking to restore or customize their rides just so.</p>
<p>What’s more, car collecting helps preserve history. We remember our national past by maintaining these admittedly fun historic vehicles for future generations to enjoy.</p>
<p>Part of the purpose of this annual observation is to “raise awareness of the vital role automotive restoration and collection plays in American society,” according to SEMA. The organization is once more trying to get a Congressional resolution to recognize the day, which would no doubt draw more public attention.</p>
