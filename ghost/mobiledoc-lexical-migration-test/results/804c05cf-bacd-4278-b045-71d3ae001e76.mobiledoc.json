Basically, fraudsters send an authentic-looking email from a business like Instagram with some urgent action you need to take. If you click on the link in the email, it will take you to a website which looks legitimate, but in fact isn’t. Of course, you’re logged out of your account, so you input your username and password, only it doesn’t work. That’s when the fraudsters have your login info for the real site, which they use to get into your account and change the password before you can get in. Dual-factor authentication should stop this from happening, but never clicking on links in emails and instead going directly to the website which supposedly sent a alert is even smarter. Learn from Bring A Trailer’s mistake."
