This will be a product of the automaker’s new one-off department and will surely raise awareness of the program in a hurry – that might be the plan. We already saw two cars from the department, the Monza SP1 and SP2 Speedsters in 2019."

If true, the new F40 would have 710-horsepower on tap, up from the original 477-hp. Without knowing curb weight we’re not exactly sure what kind of performance the new F40 will be pushing, but no doubt it will be impressive. It wouldn’t be a tribute to make a slow, sloppy modern version of such an amazing supercar."
