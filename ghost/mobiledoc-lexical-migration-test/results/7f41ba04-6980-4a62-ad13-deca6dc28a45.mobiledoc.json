Even in factory spec, a Viper GTS is a potent car, but this one has about 300 pounds of weight reduction to boost performance all around. The engine has been modified and as you can see in the photos, there’s a roll cage installed. This Dodge rides on an adjustable competition suspension, uses big slotted disc brakes, 18x12 wheels, and a gear-drive limited-slip differential to reign all that in."
