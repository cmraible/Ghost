          " MkII BJ7 went through an exhaustive restoration. That process began back in 2017 and involved the body being stripped to bare metal. Thankfully, the required rust repair was minimal. What you see now is Colorado Red over black, the original color scheme this car had when it was brand new. Just like back in the day, this car wears wire wheels and the appropriate amount of chrome, which all shines perfectly in the sunlight. A black tonneau cover ensures this roadster can be enjoyed in questionable weather, although you’ll probably not want to take it out during a storm lest it suffer any damage to that show-stopper exterior."
