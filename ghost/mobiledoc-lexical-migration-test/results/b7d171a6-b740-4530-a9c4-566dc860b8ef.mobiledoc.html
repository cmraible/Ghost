<h3 id="how-billionaires-shape-the-news-they-own">How Billionaires Shape The News They Own</h3>
<p>By David Sirota</p>
<p>In 2019, Bernie Sanders was the target of a corporate media feeding frenzy for what pundits deemed an unforgivable crime: After his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-raises-minimum-wage-to-15-dollars-2018-10">successful battle</a> to shame Amazon into raising workers’ wages, the Vermont senator dared to note that the company’s chairman, Jeff Bezos, owns the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the paper had been highly critical of Sanders’ presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Though Sanders made clear that he wasn’t claiming “Bezos is on the phone, telling the editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> what to do,” his <a href="https://fair.org/home/media-want-evidence-of-anti-sanders-bias-here-it-is/">statement was</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/bernie-sanders-washington-post-amazon-jeff-bezos/index.html">roundly</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/media/2019/08/13/bernie-sanders-bezos-washington-post-response-nr.cnn">condemned</a> for insinuating that Bezos has any editorial influence at his newspaper.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/13/washington-post-editor-attacks-bernie-sanders-conspiracy-theory-1460597">insisted</a> then-executive editor Marty Baron.</p>
<p>You can debate whether Bezos’ ownership specifically resulted in <a href="https://fair.org/home/washington-post-ran-16-negative-stories-on-bernie-sanders-in-16-hours/">consistently slanted <em>Post </em>coverage</a> against Sanders. But on the larger question of media ownership’s influence and independence, there shouldn’t be any dispute, as evidenced by what happened this week. Three years after the Sanders spat, news broke that Bezos was present in a <em>Washington Post</em> morning editorial meeting — one of <a href="https://twitter.com/CorbinBolies/status/1616083722247278592?s=20&t=OZaSb_HZt0-ufg37aiHTZA">“a number”</a> of times he has sat in on such meetings over the years. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/business/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post.html">reportedly</a> met with the newspaper’s national editors and one of its top political reporters.</p>

<p>The spectacle validated the central truism Sanders was attacked as a “conspiracy theorist” for voicing: Yes, Bezos does appear to have at least some influence at the newspaper he owns, as do all corporations and billionaires that own the media empires dominating — and distorting — the discourse.</p>
<p>In Bezos’ case, he has always been a looming presence at a news outlet he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizen-bezos-logs-on/">said</a> he bought because…</p><!--members-only-->
<p>In Bezos’ case, he has always been a looming presence at the news outlet he <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizen-bezos-logs-on/">said</a> he bought because it is “the newspaper in the capital city of the most important country in the world” and “has an incredible role to play in this democracy.” And if you thought Bezos was just philanthropically motivated rather than influence-focused, remember: His purchase of the newspaper playing that role shaping the capital city’s discourse just so happened to coincide with a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2022&id=D000023883">six-fold increase</a> in Amazon’s lobbying expenditures in Washington.</p>
<p>Bezos’ latest visit to his newsroom illustrates how billionaire and corporate influence often operates in legacy media.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2012/09/the-only-game-in-town/">documented</a> in a <em>Harpers </em>magazine exposé a decade ago, it’s less the heavy hand of a Citizen Kane <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YwAhDXCYJk">line-editing copy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs5lwqHf3Ls">bullying reporters</a>, and more the softer touch of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizen-bezos-logs-on/">Citizen Bezoses</a> subtly reminding journalists who they work for and what their priorities are. Under the ever-present threat of mass firings, reporters know that if they want to stay off that layoff list, they should try to make the owner happy.</p>
<p>In Bezos’ case, context sends a message. His visit came a few months after <em>Washington Post</em> management <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/14/washington-post-announces-more-job-cuts-next-year/">announced</a> layoffs. It also followed him making clear some of the<em> Washington Post</em> content he most appreciates. For example, he recently touted one of his paid pundits slamming Democrats for suggesting that corporate profiteering is fueling inflation (it <a href="https://foxchattanooga.com/news/nation-world/price-increases-inflation-economy-wages-spending-power-costs-rising#:~:text=Economists%20with%20the%20Federal%20Reserve,%2C%20while%20inflation%20was%205.8%25.">most</a><a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/">certainly is</a>, including at <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60252907">Amazon</a>).</p>
<p>This is but one form of discourse control in the current news ecosystem. Add to it elite media outlets routinely producing content <a href="__GHOST_URL__/pfizer-pays-to-change-the-story/">“presented by” corporations</a> and hosting <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/17/sam-bankman-fried-to-appear-alongside-volodymyr-zelensky-at-exclusive-nyt-event/">high-dollar</a><a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1616435347273154567?s=20&t=kU5LwvFGbSCSqsSpoAhSEw">conferences</a> with corporate executives they are supposed to be holding accountable. Then add billionaires using <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-lawsuit-that-could-freeze-speech-against-billionaires/">lawsuits</a> to threaten punishment against speech they don’t like. And then add <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-partisan-ghost-in-the-media-machine/">The Algorithm</a> that promotes and suppresses facts based on their ideological utility.</p>

<p>All of it sums up to today’s system of newspeak that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Oceania’s information ministers</a> could only have dreamed of.</p>
<p>And whether it’s Sanders or anyone else, those who dare mention the concerning state of affairs are instantly flogged for their blasphemy — all while corporate media outlets explain away any concerns. For example: As some <em>Washington Post</em> reporters rightly <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/washington-post-guild-jeff-bezos-layoffs-nyt-report/">freaked out</a> about their job security, The <em>New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/business/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post.html">insisted</a> that Bezos’ visit to the <em>Post</em> newsroom he owns “was seen internally as an indication of his commitment to the future of the publication.”</p>
<p>Honest reporters can still produce valuable journalism inside this dystopia (and we try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnYzT7ztUJs">feature some of them on <em>Lever Time</em></a>). But they are the bug, not the feature of the corporate media system — the lonely few exploiting rare glitches in the matrix.</p>
<p>Our mission here at <em>The Lever</em> is to build an entirely different model from scratch — a reader-supported independent news outlet whose reporting holds the powerful accountable, whether in corporate media, in executive boardrooms, or in the halls of government. In the two-plus years since our launch, we’ve achieved proof of concept — we’ve broken open <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">huge</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-secretive-billionaire-handed-his-fortune-to-the-architect-of-the-right-wing-takeover-of-the-courts/">stories</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/state-officials-warned-buttigieg-about-airline-mess/">about power brokers</a> in both parties, which has intensified pressure on public officials to act in the public’s interest.</p>
<p>That has won us no fans among billionaires, CEOs, elite media pundits, and both parties’ sycophants who want their politicians defended from — rather than subjected to — accountability.</p>
<p>For a reader-supported outlet, this catch-22 — impactful accountability reporting engendering mass backlash — remains one of the major obstacles to expanding from successful concept to larger scale. When we are mercilessly attacked for holding politicians accountable, or our content is effectively shadowbanned because it doesn’t toe a corporate or partisan line, it can drive away some reader support, making it more difficult for us to expand our reporting.</p>
<p>Then again, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403166/americans-trust-media-remains-near-record-low.aspx">surveys</a> show Americans have lost faith and trust in corporate media — so clearly a large audience senses corporate media is deeply corrupt and is looking for something more than what Citizen Bezos and his ilk are offering. The opportunity is there.</p>
<p>Thanks to your support, <em>The Lever</em> is seizing the moment and building that alternative independent media. It won’t be easy and it won’t be overnight, but we’re already doing it — and with our paying subscribers’ ongoing support, we can and will do more.</p>
