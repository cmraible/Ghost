While it's pretty easy and quite fun to make fun of electric cars, some of those lighting power beasts are indeed a sight. One exciting sector is the performance electric utility market which capitalizes on the instant torque and high output of four motors to provide speed on and off the road. So naturally, this means that automotive manufacturers everywhere have been jumping at the opportunity to corner the market and build the best in electric truck tech. So who better to make the world's most significant new generation truck than Hummer?",

This is a perfect-looking utility vehicle for any automotive enthusiast who needs something with a bit more carrying capacity than your typical car.
