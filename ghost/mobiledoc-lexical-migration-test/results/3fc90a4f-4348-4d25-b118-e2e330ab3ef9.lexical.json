One would be hard-pressed to find a Biscayne as nice as this, especially one with such a high-quality and aesthetically pleasing exterior finish. The main body glows in an attractive light green hue with the roof portion finished in a contrasting darker neutral tone.

Both charcoal and chrome trim adorn the exterior, and the tucked wheels in a charcoal finish and chrome lip complement the green exterior perfectly.",
