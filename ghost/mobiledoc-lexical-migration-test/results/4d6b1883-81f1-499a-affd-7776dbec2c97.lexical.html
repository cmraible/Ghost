<p><a href="https://gpkauctions.net/">GPK Auctions</a> is excited to welcome Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) and Hot Rod Industry Alliance (HRIA) to the Atlantic City Auction & Car Show which will take place at the Atlantic City Convention Center, February 10th – 12th, 2022!</p>
<p><a href="https://gpkauctions.net/">GPK Auctions</a> and SEMA/HRIA have teamed up to create a powerhouse event in Atlantic City! This notable partnership will emerge with the upcoming 2022 Atlantic City Auction & Car Show at the Atlantic City Convention Center.</p>

<p><a href="https://gpkauctions.net/">The 2022 event</a> will represent a “preview” of the changes on the horizon. The SEMA/HRIA footprint will begin as the Title Sponsor of the Deuce’s Wild Custom Build Competition featuring the “SEMA/HRIA - Best Build of the Show” Grand Prize Award of $15,000 and will spill-over into the event with the inclusion of numerous noteworthy SEMA/HRIA member companies displaying within the Hot Rod Alley section of the Automotive Vendor Mart.</p>
<p>With the addition of the SEMA/HRIA partnership, the NEW Atlantic City event will offer the unique combination of not only a Collector Car Auction but also a Car Corral, the Custom Build Deuce’s Wild Competition Car Show, the Joker’s Wild Competition Car Show, the Atlantic City Invitational, and the enhanced Automotive Vendor Mart for automotive addicts along the Eastern Seaboard, as well as the Ohio Valley “hotbed” of <a href="https://gpkauctions.net/">enthusiasts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gpkauctions.net/">GPK Auctions</a> has quietly been changing the driving direction of the Atlantic City event away from the “one-lane road” of classic cars and constructing a “multi-lane” event with all roads leading to an ALL-INCLUSIVE event for automotive enthusiasts of all genres to enjoy! As the SEMA/HRIA sphere of influence grows dramatically each year within the Atlantic City event, with its sponsorship of the Deuce’s Wild and its member presence (Hot Rod Alley) within our Automotive Vendor Mart, the SEMA/HRIA impact will continue to drive this event into an East Coast automotive “highway” that will undoubtedly bridge the gap between the hobby as we’ve known it, and the emergence of the next generation of enthusiasts!</p>
