Others include Junior Johnson, Ned Jarrett, Ralph Earnhardt, Jack Ingram, and Harry Grant. However, Junior Johnson was the most successful Grand National competitor at the Hickory Motor Speedway, racing up seven wins."

          "Three different times the track at Hickory Motor Speedway was reconfigured. The first big change came in 1955 when it was shrunk to 0.4 miles but kept the dirt surface. In 1967 it was paved, ending the days of dirt racing. Just like at other tracks which were converted, some think it should have been kept the way it was. Then in 1970 the track was shortened to .363 miles, its present-day length."

Others would follow, including Richard Petty, Herb Thomas, and Junior Johnson. Later, the track was featured prominently in the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Series and when that was transformed into the Budweiser Late Model Series (called the Busch Grand National Series and now the Nationwide Series). As time wore on, Hickory was featured in the series schedule less. 1998 marked the final time the Busch Grand National Series visited the track as more Winston Cup Series tracks were added to the schedule and the short track was no longer fashionable."

Often hosted on the same night are CARS Tour events with Late Model and Super Late Model touring series cars. Crowds still show up to cheer on the racers and enjoy a more intimate motorsports experience."
