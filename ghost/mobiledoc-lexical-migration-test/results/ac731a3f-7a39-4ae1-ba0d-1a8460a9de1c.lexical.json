Although the engine produced decent power for what it was, it did not do the Corvettes reputation of being a solid contender to the Cadillacs and Jaguars of the time any favors. 1955 marked the roadster’s first V8 engine option and it was that 195-horsepower 265-cid engine that nudged Chevy in the right direction with many upgrades coming the following year.

For the first year ever, the Corvette was now available with outside door handles, roll-up windows, and an optional removable hardtop. 1957 saw the introduction of a new 283-cid engine and a Fuel Injected option that produced a national record of 1-bhp per cubic inch. Nearly 7,000 examples were produced that year. Styling, power, and production numbers continued to rise before peaking for the final year of the C1 Corvette.

Although the car was still being used by GM to roll out new technology, the C5 Corvette did not change much visually from year to year after the 1999 model year. Some of the changes included a gradual bump in power output, peaking with 405-horsepower in 2004, and the addition of a heads-up display. The generation was a highly successful one that proved the Corvette could both keep up with Ferrari and be fuel-efficient enough to avoid the Gas-Guzzler Tax. In keeping with tradition, there were many special editions of the C5 Corvette. This included the Z06, an Indy 500 car, a 50th Anniversary Edition, and a Commemorative Edition. ",
