<p>If you ever fantasized about owning your very own 3D-printed <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mustang-mach-e-pace-car/">little pony</a> sculpture, you should’ve just ordered the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/crashed-mustang-mach-e/">Ford Mustang Mach-E First Edition</a>. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wichita-police-backfiring-mustang/">Blue Oval</a> just revealed the abstract printed sculptures it will be giving to every owner of the First Edition, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-mustang-57th-anniversary/">made specially</a> by the Ford Advanced Manufacturing Center.</p>
<blockquote><em>Meanwhile, police are on the hunt for a backfiring Mustang. Learn more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wichita-police-backfiring-mustang/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>Each wireframe little pony sculpture looks just like the galloping pony badge <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/mustang-mayhem-ponies-on-the-parkway/">Mustang enthusiasts</a> have grown to love, only it’s in 3D. The sculpture matches the exterior of each Mach-E Frist Edition. Instead of painting the statues, each one is dyed Carbonized Grey, Grabber Blue, or Rapid Red Metallic, the only three paint options for the First Edition model.</p>

<p>An included baseplate has an inscription reading “Ford Mustang Mach-E Launch Team, Thank You For Your Support.” The vehicle VIN is also inscribed in the base. Ford describes the statue as a “collectible.” We’re wondering if in 20 years or so any will be auctioned as automobilia.</p>
<p>Ford also says the little pony statues are “allowing additive manufacturing to establish a new-use case with the enterprise.” That might be a little bit of an overstatement, but sure.</p>

<p>Anyone who paid close attention to the Mustang Mach-E reveal event back in November 2019, which seems like it happened approximately 5 years ago, might remember this wireframe pony statue. It was on the display for the reveal, giving a more modern feel to the familiar Mustang logo.</p>
<p>If you didn’t grab a Mach-E First Edition, don’t fret. Ford has revealed the new Mach-E GT and GT Performance Edition models. While they don’t come with a little pony statue, they do have illuminated pony badges. BlueCruise, the new Ford hands-free driving tech for highway cruising is also included. Also, the GT Performance Edition does 0-60 in just 3.5 seconds. Just know the new Ford Mustang Mach-E GT and GT Performance Edition are expensive, starting at $59,900 and $64,900 respectively. Or, you could take that money and buy a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">really cool classic Mustang</a>. We know you’ll choose wisely.</p>
