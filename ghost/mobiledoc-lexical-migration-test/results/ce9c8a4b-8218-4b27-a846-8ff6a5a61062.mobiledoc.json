A well-polished coat of white paint contrasts nicely with the black convertible top, with both in good repair. Body panels are straight and free of major blemishes. Freshly redone chrome sparkles in the sunlight, highlighting areas like the front grille, bumpers, and rear luggage rack. The Packard Adonis decorative radiator cap, which depicts a partially reclining woman, is complete and polished to show off details. All the glass is free of cracks, including on the headlight lenses. Red wire wheels wear a fresh coat of paint, while polished hubcaps, wide whitewall tires, and black covers for the spares mounted to the front fenders complete the period looks on the exterior."

It was also known to be reliable, so owners enjoyed all that power without having to fix the engine as often, which was a nice bonus you also get to benefit from today. What’s more, the porcelain manifolds have been restored, taking the engine compartment back to its original condition."
