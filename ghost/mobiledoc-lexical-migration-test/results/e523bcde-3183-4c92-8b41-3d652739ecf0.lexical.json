Tacchi did all the necessary work on the bike. Then, in 1972 it was purchased by Bud Ekins, a stunt rider who was friends with Steve McQueen. California motorcycle collector Richard Morris purchased it next, who sold it to Dale Walksler, who runs the Wheels Through Time museum in North Carolina. It’s still in the museum, so if you want to see the Traub in person, that’s the place to go.",
