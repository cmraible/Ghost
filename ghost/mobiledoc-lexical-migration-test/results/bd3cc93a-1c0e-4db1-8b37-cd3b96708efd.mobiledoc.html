<hr>
<p>It’s hard to believe it, but 20 years ago this past September the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">Porsche</a> Carrera GT concept was first revealed to the world. It was the beginning of not only a new decade and century but also a new millennium and Porsche wanted to show off a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thief-takes-porsche-911-gts-on-a-shockingly-short-getaway-drive/">moonshot car</a> to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-the-official-porsche-birthday-party-unfold/">celebrate</a>. It certainly looked dramatic enough for the role, but what really made the Carrera GT unique was its raw, uninhibited driving dynamics.</p>

<p>The car that helped herald Porsche’s arrival in the 21st Century was visceral and free of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/crashes-ferrari-812-superfast/">electronic nannies</a> which have typified vehicle development of the past two decades. While it helped put on display plenty of cutting-edge designs, the production car marked many lasts for the German automaker. For these reasons and many more we celebrate the 20th anniversary of its reveal.</p>
<p>Held on a rainy night in Paris at the Place de l’Étoile, Walter Röhrl had the difficult task of keeping full control of the unbridled, brutal <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/exotic-car-collections-arent-cheap-to-own/">supercar</a> in less-than-ideal conditions in front of the international automotive media. A seasoned driver, Röhrl did so beautifully and, as they say, the rest is history.</p>

<p>A hard-hitting V10 sits mid-mounted in the Carrera GT. Never again has Porsche made a production vehicle with such a setup. Closest has been the 918 Spyder, although that used a V8 paired with an electric motor. And while we love the hybrid supercar, the Carrera GT was Porsche’s last primal supercar before electrification took over.</p>
<p>Porsche at first didn’t intend to turn the Carrera GT into a production supercar. It was really a race car, developed from modules of a racer that was bound for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-this-mini-movie-about-the-1955-le-mans/">24 Hours of Le Mans</a>. That’s partly what’s made the production vehicle so wonderful, because like many great supercars it was designed for unparalleled track performance, not real world practicality.</p>

<p>With no stability control, traction control, and no electronic “helps” to speak of as well as the presence of carbon brakes, manual transmission, and a carbon clutch, the Porsche Carrera GT is a notoriously difficult vehicle to handle. But, without those additional hinderances jumping in, drivers say the supercar is highly rewarding for those with the proper skill.</p>
<p>Even without the controversy of Paul Walker dying as a passenger in a Carrera GT, not to mention an infamous track day death which resulted in a multi-million-dollar settlement and Jay Leno famously spinning one out at Talladega, the Porsche supercar is an automotive icon and will continue to be one for some time.</p>
