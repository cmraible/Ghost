<hr>
<p>Street racing is a stupid thing to do, even though some enthusiasts at least once in their life fall for the allure. Some street racers learned the hard way just how dumb it is when they ran from Michigan State Police, then hid in a dumpster. There are better ways to get your thrills behind the wheel.</p>

<p>According to a local news report, the incident in question went down on the night of January 8 at about 12:30 am. Someone called police in Highland Park about 40-plus cars participating in street racing on Woodward Avenue. Responding officers saw several Dodge Chargers speeding away from the scene as they approached, giving chase to one of them in particular.</p>

<p>That one red Charger led Michigan State Police troopers on a high-speed chase, blowing through red lights and blacking out to lose the law. That maneuver worked for a bit, however troopers later spotted it in Detroit, chasing it westbound on I-94, eventually successfully deploying Stop Sticks near the Washtenaw County line.</p>
<p>The car disabled, the driver and two passengers bailed. They tried hiding in a dumpster, probably thinking they were super clever and that the cops would never look there. Little did they know a police helicopter was overhead, using infrared camera technology to easily track their every move.</p>
<p>If you want to race, great, go to a track. That might mean getting serious and investing some money into the sport, but the financial toll of getting chased down by the cops, paying numerous fines, doing time in jail, posting bail, possibly losing your vehicle, etc. isn’t worth the risk. Legitimate racing is where it’s at, plus tracks need all the support they can get these days.</p>
