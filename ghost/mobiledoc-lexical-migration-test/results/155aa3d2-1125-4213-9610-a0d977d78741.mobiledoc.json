Anyway, on the social media site there’s a car-related video which has gone viral. Apparently, a woman in Malaysia decided to share with the world the moment she surprised her husband with a new Lamborghini Huracan Evo. Understandably, many people are amazed and keep watching it to vicariously live some unfulfilled fantasy."

Yeah, we’re wanting to know what their parents do that these two kids can afford a $650,000 Italian supercar, especially since they’re from Malaysia. Actually, the wife is some sort of cosmetics entrepreneur, or so we’re told, so apparently she just has all kinds of cash. But wait, there’s more to this story."

Then the wife makes the husband put the mask he is wearing in the car over his eyes so he can’t see. Plus, the guy is wearing a designer murse. And the wife makes duck lips while posing for the camera. Just watching it requires a thorough washing of the eyes after."

With the keys to the Huracan Evo in hand maybe he doesn’t need a job anymore. After all, his wife seems to be making plenty."

Sure, there will be time for that later, after he gets through all the items on the honey-do list we just know is going to be a mile long. But is a free supercar worth this level of control – we mean devotion? Doesn’t this woman have a mother or sister who can help out? What about the mother-in-law? Or is she just that annoying they wouldn’t dare subject themselves to her domineering? Maybe she should buy a Lamborghini for them."
