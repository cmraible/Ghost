Arrgh.\n\nI’ve only left my desk for about 10 minutes the whole day, and only achieved a fraction of what I wanted to do.\n\nThis, I suspect, is the downside of having a job you’re really passionate about. The highs are higher, but the lows are lower.\n\nI just want to go home, dive into a bath of whisky and never come out again.\n\n\n"
