<p>Everyone from powerful Democratic Rep. James Clyburn to Republican <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/02/lindsey-graham-biden-scotus-00004388">garbage dump loiterer</a> Lindsey Graham is angling for President Joe Biden to pick South Carolina District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs to replace outgoing justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court — and the administration has confirmed that Childs is in the running. But as we highlight in two <em>American Prospect </em>pieces linked to below, Childs’ history when it comes to labor issues and criminal justice reform suggests she would be a very troubling choice for the high court.</p>

    <li><a href="https://prospect.org/justice/clyburn-pushes-management-side-labor-attorney-for-supreme-court/"><strong>Clyburn Pushes Management-Side Labor Attorney for Supreme Court</strong></a><strong></strong>(The American Prospect) <em>— “[Childs’] experience is nothing like the ‘diversity of experience’ that the Biden administration has championed. Rather, her record looks much more like the typical corporate lawyer that the White House has purposefully tried to get away from in its attempt to remake the federal bench. Appointing a Black woman with a history of defending employers against discrimination cases brought under the Civil Rights Act would certainly undermine the message Biden has sought to convey with this nomination, and make for a confusing capstone to the administration’s judicial project. And with other Black women available who do not have anything close to this record, it would be especially puzzling.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://prospect.org/justice/michelle-childs-punitive-criminal-justice-rulings-repeatedly-overturned/"><strong>Michelle Childs’s Punitive Criminal Justice Rulings Were Repeatedly Overturned</strong></a><strong></strong>(The American Prospect) <em>— “On numerous occasions, Childs issued such punitive decisions on criminal justice issues that those rulings were eventually overturned on appeal by higher courts. Throughout the 2010s, a period where criminal justice reform was increasingly prioritized for activists and Democratic politicians alike, Childs ruled against both plaintiffs and defendants who alleged everything from excessive force by prison guards to ineffective legal counsel to sentencing errors.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/opinion/corporations-democracy.html?referringSource=articleShare"><em><strong>I Wouldn’t Bet on the Kind of Democracy Big Business Is Selling Us</strong></em></a><em><strong></strong></em>(The New York Times)<em> — “A fantasy capitalism that magically balances the interests of workers, investors, communities and shareholders has a strong allure, but pursuing it is a self-defeating strategy — and rooted in political despair. Focusing political energy on securing the commitment of a group of business elites would undermine the engagement of a broad democratic base that must be the real basis of substantial reform. To address many of our deepest problems, nothing less than a redistribution of economic and political power will be needed, and it will be achieved only over the opposition of business and the wealthy.”</em></li>

    <li><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/01/surveillance-data-collection-ads-news-media/"><strong>Major Media Outlets That Use Invasive User Tracking Are Lobbying Against Regulation</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Intercept) <em>— “In a filing last week, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group, reported it was lobbying against a push at the Federal Trade Commission to restrict the collection and sale of personal data for the purpose of delivering advertisements. The IAB represents both data brokers and online media outlets that depend on digital advertising, such as CNN, the </em>New York Times<em>, MSNBC, </em>Time, U.S. News and World Report<em>, the </em>Washington Post, Vox, the Orlando Sentinel<em>, Fox News, and dozens of other media companies.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.substack.documented.net/p/pay-to-play-raga"><strong>The Corporate Cash Going To Republican Attorneys General Group Working to Undermine Democracy</strong></a><strong></strong>(Documented) <em>— “Some corporate donors might have been momentarily nervous about giving [to the Republican Attorneys General Association] after January 6th.... But the damage doesn’t seem to have been lasting. Their total revenue for the second half of 2021 was down a little, but not by much compared to 2019, the previous non-election year ($6.1m in 2021 vs $6.6m in 2019). At least one corporation has gone back on its promise to not fund RAGA. A spokesperson for CenterPoint Energy told Documented on January 19, 2021 that: ‘CenterPoint Energy will not make any contributions to the Republican Attorneys General Association in 2021.’ According to the latest filing, it gave $20,000 in November 2021, and then another $20,000 in December.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/food/2022/02/national-restaurant-association-relief-revitalization-fund-pandemic-mcdonalds-subway-nra/"><strong>Why Big Chains Thrived While Small Restaurants Died</strong></a> (Mother Jones) <em>— “As the pandemic raged, tension inherent in the [National Restaurant Association]’s mission gave way to open warfare as the industry cracked along the fault lines that the NRA long sought to obscure. New voices ascended to challenge the association’s power, and even succeeded to some degree. But as the crisis enters its third year, the NRA continues to guard the interests of its large corporate members while neighborhood diners and taverns wonder whether they’re about to serve their last meal.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2022-02-03/getting-personal-about-climate-change-made-me-a-better-reporter-boiling-point"><strong>Getting Personal About Climate Change Made Me A Better Reporter</strong></a> (Los Angeles Times) <em>— “In the same way that journalists ought to be comfortable denouncing systemic racism and pushing politicians to tackle homelessness, we need to get comfortable decrying the horrors of the climate crisis and demanding solutions.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/traffic-tickets-income-adjustment-rich/621452/"><strong>The Other Speed Trap</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Atlantic) <em>— “Despite decades of rising income inequality, American lawmakers have failed to take the idea of income-adjusted fines seriously. In most of the United States, every person pays the same price for a traffic ticket, regardless of their income or social circumstance. For poor Americans, a traffic ticket can be a life-altering disaster. For rich Americans, it’s a minor inconvenience. The American criminal-justice system goes hard on people who can’t afford to pay traffic fines and easy on those who can. In 13 states, failure to pay a traffic ticket is still a misdemeanor punishable with jail time. In 34 states, missing a payment means losing your license. In a country where 86 percent of adults drive to work, losing your license can mean losing your job, and the resources to ever pay off tickets. With income-adjusted fines, financial punishment recognizes financial circumstance.”</em></li>

It Changed My Life.</strong></a> (The New York Times) <em>— “Those who seek to ban books are wrong no matter how dangerous books can be. Books are inseparable from ideas, and this is really what is at stake: the struggle over what a child, a reader and a society are allowed to think, to know and to question.”</em></li>
