In the video, the guy is seen wearing a shirt that reads “American Muscle Cars” while he stares intently at the electric vehicle. For a moment, it looks like he might be admiring the car but it soon becomes clear that the man is quite salty to say the least. So, like any logical person would, he took a key and ran it across the body which caused a ridiculous amount of damage."

It's pretty reasonable to assume the shop might be embellishing the price a bit but the point still stands that there was a lot of damage done to the car. All of this was caught on Camera, something that police have said will make a great case when they find the guy. Overall, it's a crazy circumstance that points out some of the worst aspects of puris culture and muscle car people like you and I must stand up and say that that behavior is just not ok."
