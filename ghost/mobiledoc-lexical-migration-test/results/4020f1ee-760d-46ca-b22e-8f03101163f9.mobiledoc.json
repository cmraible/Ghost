Everyone has an opinion on this, or so it seems, and that has made prices of any 964 absolutely skyrocket."

Rarely do they change hands, so when one does become available it goes for big money, if it isn’t sold without any public announcement. This is why 150 hours were spent detailing the car, because it’s far from just another Porsche 964."
