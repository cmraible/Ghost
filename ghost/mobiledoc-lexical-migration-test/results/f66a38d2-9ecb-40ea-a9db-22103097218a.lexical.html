<p>Apparently, we are not the only ones interested in Finding Old Cars. Over the past few weeks there have been some interesting submissions to <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com/vehicles">FindingOldCars.com</a>, from an iconic <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com/vehicles?q%5Bmake_eq%5D=Dodge">Dodge Power Wagon</a> to a <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com/vehicles?q%5Bmake_eq%5D=Mercury">1967 Mercury Cougar</a> symbolic of American Muscle. Treasures from all over the U.S. are being <a href="https://www.findingoldcars.com/finder">submitted</a> including vehicles from North Carolina, Georgia, Indiana and New York.</p>
<h3 id="dodge-power-wagon"><strong>Dodge Power Wagon</strong></h3>
<p>The Dodge Power Wagon is probably best known from the model released shortly after World War II. The Power Wagon was the first four-wheel drive vehicle to be offered to the American public in 1946 and was based on the military spec 3/4-ton truck. Originally Dodge used a model number of WDX and then later in 1957 it became the WM-300, the term Power Wagon was actually a generic term for a civilian four-wheel drive vehicle. These vehicles were popular after World War II as America went back to work.</p>

<h3 id="mercury-cougar"><strong>Mercury Cougar</strong></h3>
<p>Cougar is a term used jokingly in our modern culture but Mercury was serious about the Cougar being a performance icon for the company. The Mercury Cougar is not quite at the $410,000 mark of the Power Wagon mentioned above but in September 2022 Mecum Auctions sold a <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/DA0922-522083/1970-mercury-cougar-boss-302-eliminator/">1970 Mercury Cougar</a> for over $100,000! The most recent $100,000 plus Cougar is one of six that have sold in excess of $100,000 in the past three years.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/1967/Mercury/Cougar">1967 Mercury Cougar</a> was named "Car of the Year", by Motor Trend magazine and was the most successful model launch in company history. Only 150,893 were produced in 1967 and of those only 27,221 were the XR-7 luxury model. In <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1968-mercury-cougar/">1968 the XR7-G,</a> named for Mercury road racer Dan Gurney, came with all sorts of performance add-ons, including a hood scoop, Lucas fog lamps, and hood pins. There were many comfort and performance options available for the Cougar, including a power driver's seat that could be swiveled for ease of entry/egress.</p>
