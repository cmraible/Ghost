<p>This car has been quite successful at car shows, winning quite a few first place awards in its class, thanks to the frame-off restoration performed back in 1991. That work is documented in photos and more. As you can see, all details about this Jaguar are correct and in excellent condition, from the nice shine in the paint to those wide whitewall tires. Red leather seat upholstery and factory gauges all look spectacular as well. Even the trunk presents nicely, showing nothing was left neglected in the restoration and everything has been meticulously cared for since.</p>
<p>Being an MC model, this XK140 comes with some upgraded equipment right out of the factory. Among the additional features is a dual exhaust system, fog lights, and wire wheels. To pump up performance a little more, the cylinder head from the competition Jaguar C-Type was also included, resulting in peak output of 210 bhp.</p>
<p>It was in 1954 the XK140 became the flagship for the Jaguar sportscar lineup, assuming the lead from the legendary XK120. That alone makes this car historically significant, but as you add in the celebrity ties, owning it is even more compelling.  Purchased from Trebek by the current owner back on April 14, 1976, documentation of the sale includes a copy of the bill of sale, signed letters from Trebek, and several photos of the celebrity in the Jaguar. A Jaguar Heritage Certificate is also included.</p>
