<p>By 1969, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/lsa-1969-chevy-k5-blazer/">Chevrolet</a> had refined its prized response to Ford’s Mustang in a way that proved the GM pony car was a worthy competitor. More than 75-percent of all Camaros sold that year were V8-powered and almost 25-percent were the top-of-the-line Z/28 and SS models. Buyers had realized that they could get a better built, more powerful sports car for less. Even when comparing apples to apples the Z/28 was relatively equally balanced with the Boss 302 but cost quite a bit less.</p>

<p>Then there were looks. This is where things get a bit subjective but immaculate examples like this one being offered at Mecum’s upcoming Las Vegas event makes a good point for the classic F-Body. Finished in a shiny Orange paint with Black Rally Stripes and a black vinyl top, this is a true head turner. Well organized under the hood is a rebuilt and numbers matching 290-horsepower DZ-suffix 302-cid V8 engine mated to a numbers matching M22 4-speed manual transmission.</p>

It has original black seats, door panels, carpet, and dash pad. It rolls on original 15x7 Rally wheels, which are wrapped in correct Goodyear E70-15 Polyglas tires. It gets stopping power from power disc brakes. See this highly original Camaro Z/28 <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/LN1122-524293/1969-chevrolet-camaro-z28/">here</a>.</p>
