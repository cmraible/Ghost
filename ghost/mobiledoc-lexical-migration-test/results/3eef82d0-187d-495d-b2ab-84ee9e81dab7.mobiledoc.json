Scrutinizing critics will be satisfied with the factory-correct Tor Red “Hi-Impact” paint job, keeping the look of this classic pure.

There’s also a factory-correct “High Trim Grade” black interior, so you get the full experience of what the 1970 Plymouth Cuda AAR was like when it first rolled off the assembly line."
