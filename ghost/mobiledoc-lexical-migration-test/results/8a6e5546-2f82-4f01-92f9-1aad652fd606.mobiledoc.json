These little Italian cars weren’t built for raw speed or unbridled power, but instead they got Italians moving again after the ravages of WWII. And while they’re not fast, as Leno points out you’ll still have a blast driving them because they’re so lively. Anyway, if you haven’t watched the video you really should because it’s entertaining, especially seeing Leno drive one of these cars."
