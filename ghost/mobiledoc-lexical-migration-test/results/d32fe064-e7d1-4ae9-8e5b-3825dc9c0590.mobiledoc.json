Understandably, many found the actions to be disrespectful and heavy-handed. It was also disruptive for the family of Andrew Beazley, the young man who was killed suddenly."

Many were also cited for not wearing a helmet, with one man interviewed by local journalists claiming he removed his briefly to help direct traffic. Police also towed away motorcycles for other infractions."
