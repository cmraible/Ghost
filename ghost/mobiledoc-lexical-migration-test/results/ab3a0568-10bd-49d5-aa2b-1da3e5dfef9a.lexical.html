<p>Nintendo has just announced its results for the year ending March 2019, and there are some pretty amazing statistics! For one, the Nintendo Switch has sold 32.37 million units, having sold 14.49 million units sold in the last quarter. Also:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nintendo Switch software sales at 163.61 million</li>
    <li>Nintendo 3DS has sold 74.84 million units</li>
    <li>Nintendo 3DS software sales at 375.97 million</li>
</ul>
<p>For last fiscal year, Nintendo set the goal at 20 million switch units sold. However for the next fiscal year, they’ve surprisingly estimated 17 million units. Perhaps that means that Nintendo don’t have much planned for 2019 – Hopefully not.</p>
