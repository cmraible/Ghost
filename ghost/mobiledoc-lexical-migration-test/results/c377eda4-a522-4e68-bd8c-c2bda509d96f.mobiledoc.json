For the Hot Wheels Legends Tour, you definitely see both extremes rolled out by those hoping their ride is immortalized as a little diecast toy. For the UK leg of the tour this year, the judges picked one of the extreme builds, called the Misfit, which is part Ford and part BWM."

Instead of restoring it like some would do, he chopped the thing up and turned to a BMW E30 for the engine and drivetrain, adding a blower to make it even wilder."

The man took his time getting the setup right, using BBS wheels donated by a Ferrari GT racer, modifying the offset for six grueling months so the stance was just to his liking. The man’s perfectionist tendencies certainly paid off."

The same green used for the body panels is also present throughout the interior, tying the two spaces together well. You’ll also note the bronze finish on the wheels and the exhaust header are quite similar, complimenting the green nicely. Since the engine sits exposed like in any proper hot rod, Charalambous made sure to dress everything up using silver and black for a toned-down presentation."
