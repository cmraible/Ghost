This is a real possibility that many car enthusiasts go through when considering purchasing an exotic. Of course, we're not just talking about supercars, either. Instead, the most cars you'll want to import will be mid-level sports cars that somehow made their way into pop-culture, such as the Supra, Silvia, or the famously illegal R34 GTR. However, this option is not entirely without risk, as one automotive enthusiast found along with nearly 4,000 other owners when a ship went down over a month ago.",

This model was referred to as the SiR trim, which came with an inline-four engine capable of 197 horsepower. While this may not seem like much for today's standards, the cars were made in minimal numbers making it a rare dream car for the owner. Unfortunately, along with losing his beloved JDM icon, he also is having trouble finding compensation for his car as the insurance company won't give him what he says it's worth. We hope all of the owners of these various cars are paid back for what they've lost, which may be possible now that the vehicles have been found.",
