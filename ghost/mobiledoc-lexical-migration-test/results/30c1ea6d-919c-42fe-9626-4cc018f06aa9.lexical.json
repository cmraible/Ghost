The\nonce untouchable social media juggernaut has been plagued by a slew of charges\nregarding its privacy practices and other forms of questionable conduct. Less\nthan a year ago, Facebook (FB) suffered a staggering loss of $119 billion in a\nsingle day. At its zenith, Facebook was valued at $611.56 billion. While the\nstock has recovered markedly since the mid-2018 crisis, it is still playing\ncatch up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Millions of <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions/\">users have quit Facebook</a>&nbsp;according to Edison Research (15 million fewer users in 2018 compared to 2017). Rather than leaving social media entirely, analysts believe that people are switching affiliation from one social engagement platform to another. Other popular options include Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, and Instagram. Throughout, a shift has taken place in the type of engagement options that users are choosing. Video is rapidly replacing text messaging and social media platforms are making accommodations for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57450\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price.png 974w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price-300x237.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price-768x606.png 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price-370x292.png 370w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price-760x599.png 760w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2019/08/facebook-stock-price-740x583.png 740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>This begs the question</strong>: Where will society be placing its trust with\nsocial media networks? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Video is really booming in social media</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as no surprise that video chat is the most engaging\nand immersive form of multimedia online communication. It incorporates a\ntreasure trove of elements including audio + visual content in a secure, HD\nfeed. The use of video functionality has blossomed in recent years, thanks to\ndramatic improvements in global Internet connectivity and accessibility. Social\nmedia apps now showcase the finest video streaming technology of our time, and\nthings are only getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The relevance of Reddit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key components of social media are the social element and the media coverage. <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/best-tech-subreddits-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Reddit</a> is one of the most popular platforms in the world, with a top 10 ranking in the US. This platform serves as a forum for anything its members want to talk about. Each of the little communities are known as subreddits, and there are at least 1 million of them covering different topics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People can engage with fellow community members all over the\nworld in real time. While the community guidelines attempt to instill a sense\nof structure among members, there are few safeguards, and little moderation of\nuser activity. This makes it a less than ideal place for safe interactions and\na daunting prospect for young, old, or impressionable minds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Organic or doctored video content?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The failure of many social media platforms to guard against\nhate speech, improper content, or lack of authenticity is certainly something\nto be concerned about. And then of course there are the ranking social media\nplatforms such as Snapchat, TikTok and even Instagram which actively promote\nthe use of video content, with all sorts of special effects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While users certainly enjoy tinkering with filters, lenses,\ncolors, hues, saturation, animation, and special effects, there is a lot to be\nsaid for authentic online communications in the form of video content. By using\nvideo as the primary medium of communication, several up-and-coming social\nmedia sites are cutting a swathe with audiences around the world. It&#8217;s worth\npointing out why video is booming in social media:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Smartphones and tablets are ideally suited to HD\nvideo functionality</li><li>3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi Internet connectivity make\nexcellent quality video chat possible</li><li>Video technology is cost efficient, able to\nscale, and designed for interactive communications</li><li>Video guarantees an authentic communication\nexperience in real-time (seeing is believing?)</li><li>Human beings crave face-to-face communication\n&amp; that&#8217;s precisely what video provides</li><li>Video conferencing is ideal for business and\npersonal use, with real-time sharing of news, updates, announcements, or simple\nchitchat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The tech aficionados, designers, and developers, realize the\nincredible potential inherent in video streaming technology. As a case in\npoint, Say LLC, the creators of Say: Share Together!\nhave crafted a powerful interactive video-streaming app for Android and iOS\ndevices. Unlike traditional communication mediums like text messaging, bulletin\nboards and other advertisement-laden social media platforms, this one allows\nsafe and ad-free video messaging, with authentic face-to-face connections, and\nHD video communications between users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology has advanced to the point that it is possible to connect with just 2 users, or dozens of people simultaneously. With video messaging, it&#8217;s easy to keep friends and families up-to-date with real-time broadcasts, or recorded video communications. People have come to realize that the impersonal nature of text messaging does not serve these treasured relationships well. For this reason, developers are pouring tremendous effort into creating user-friendly options for face-to-face communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Millennials driving the video boom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A study by <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190117005173/en/Video-Calls-Fast-Popular-Voice-Calls-Reaching\">Vonage</a> claims there has been a 175% uptick in regular ‘live video usage’ over the past 3 years. Millennials are driving this change, with some 25% of young folks regularly enjoying video chat on a daily basis. Upwards of 40% of people aged 35 – 54 use video chat, and 25% of those older than 55 enjoy video chatting more than they did a year ago. Clearly, the numbers support the facts. Mobile functionality now dominates laptop and desktop users as the primary hardware for video calling at 68%.&nbsp; When quizzed about why video chat functionality is so popular, the majority of respondents simply had this to say: <strong>“…</strong> <strong><em>It creates a more personal experience compared to other channels.</em>”</strong></p>\n"
