When we say ‚Äúextreme‚Äù that‚Äôs actually a bit of an understatement. With an estimated worth of something around $20 billion, he unlike Elon Musk likes to really flaunt it with material possessions, including some of the craziest vehicles you‚Äôll ever see. His latest one, an oversized Hummer H1, is a perfect example."

          "You would think there are few places to drive such a behemoth, but Rainbow Sheikh uses this and his other oversized vehicles to cart around his friends. That‚Äôs why the interior isn‚Äôt a scale replica with seats and a steering wheel three times the size of a regular car. Instead, it‚Äôs more like a motor home for partying, complete with a bathroom. The guy has a 1950 Dodge Power Wagon oversized build which contains multiple bedrooms, so he might go that direction with the Hummer as well."

The Goliath Hummer current is at the Off-Road History Museum located in Al Madam, UAE. We‚Äôre sure plenty of people make the trek there just to see this thing and get their photo taken in front of it."
