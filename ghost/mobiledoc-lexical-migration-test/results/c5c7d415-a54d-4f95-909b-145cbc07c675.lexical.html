<p>The Biden administration has declined to rescind a controversial Trump administration guidance that is helping nursing home executives shield themselves from legal consequences for COVID-19 deaths. The inaction coincides with the nursing home industry lobbying the executive office of the president through an operative with direct ties to President Biden, according to federal records reviewed by <em>The Daily Poster</em>. </p>

<p>“The idea of abolition has caught on with a growing minority of Americans, and it became one of the proposals most associated with the past year’s outcry, because it promises what reform cannot: an actual end to police violence and a commitment to the investments — in education and health care and housing — that would, theoretically, supplant the supposed need for agents with guns roaming the streets.” — <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/05/george-floyd-death-police-reform.html">Zak Cheney-Rice, writing for <em>New York Magazine</em></a><em></em>one year after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd</p>

<p>It is going to cost the United States $634 billion over the next decade to maintain its nuclear forces, according to a new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57240">report</a>. Almost two-thirds of those costs are for the Department of Defense, mostly to maintain ballistic missile submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles. About one-third is for the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>That’s 1.5 times the <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-19-trillion-house-covid-relief-bill">cost of all of the $1,400 stimulus checks</a> that were sent to people through the American Rescue Plan earlier this year.</p>
<p>It’s nearly 14 times the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/eviction-may-await-millions-americans-summer-here-s-what-biden-ncna1266676">$47 billion</a> that Congress has spent so far this year helping Americans who are behind on rent.</p>
<p>It’s over one-third of the cost of cancelling the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/">$1.7 trillion</a> in student debt held by Americans, most of which is never going to be repaid.</p>
<p>The new CBO estimate represents a 28-percent increase over the last 10-year estimate that the CBO made on U.S. nuclear forces two years ago. And it comes just weeks after a new analysis from the Center for International Policy, a foreign policy think tank in Washington, <a href="https://3ba8a190-62da-4c98-86d2-893079d87083.usrfiles.com/ugd/3ba8a1_53cf880837cd4b178a80adfd0f00812f.pdf">found that</a> “In 2020 alone, the CEOs of the [Pentagon’s] top five contractors received a total of $105.4 million in compensation.” About half of the Pentagon’s budget goes directly to corporations such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, according to the report.</p>
<p>So far, the deficit scolds who wanted to narrow eligibility for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/read-my-lips-2000-now/">stimulus checks</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-19/cancel-debt-student-loan-relief-should-target-the-neediest">student debt cancellation</a>, or rent relief haven’t complained about the spending.</p>
<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-scoop">TODAY’S SCOOP:</h3>
<p>President Joe Biden’s former longtime legislative director has been directly lobbying the executive office on behalf of the nursing home industry, according to federal records reviewed by <em>The Daily Poster</em>. The lobbying has occurred as the Biden administration has declined to rescind a Trump administration guidance that is helping nursing home executives shield themselves from legal consequences for COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>At issue is a 2005 law, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, known as the PREP Act, which authorizes federal authorities to grant certain types of legal immunity during public health emergencies. This past January, President Donald Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued an <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/guidance/sites/default/files/hhs-guidance-documents/2101081078-jo-advisory-opinion-prep-act-complete-preemption-01-08-2021-final-hhs-web.pdf">advisory opinion</a> under the PREP Act granting immunity to nursing homes for some of their business decisions during the pandemic. </p>
<p>“That HHS opinion has since become a core part of the legal strategy for many of the nursing homes as they argue for immunity,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/nursing-home-covid-lawsuits-490233"><em>Politico </em>reported</a> last week, adding, “And while many federal judges have so far rejected nursing homes’ arguments, trial lawyers, advocates and other experts say the strategy is extending litigation through appeals.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has been touting its use of the PREP Act as part of three measures designed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-expands-efforts-to-recruit-more-vaccinators/">to authorize</a> more professionals to serve as vaccinators. However, the administration has so far declined to use its power to revoke or change the Trump-era HHS guidance <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/senior-living-communities-liability-covid-19-countermeasures-and-prep-act-tide">that</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-liability-insi/at-the-urging-of-nursing-homes-a-law-is-amended-and-covid-court-claims-are-slowed-idUSKBN29X1DG">interpreted</a> the PREP Act differently from the courts, which have ruled against nursing homes invoking the law to claim immunity.</p>
<p>At the same time, the nursing home industry’s chief lobbying group, the American Health Care Association, has <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/b21165eb-289a-47e6-9191-62e2f9bf7bb1/print/">ramped up its lobbying in recent months</a>, including <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/80d78991-5016-4b63-963d-2f687090e720/print/">lobbying on liability issues</a>. In <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/189caf22-1cbc-452a-bbed-baf2ca87c680/print/">December</a>, the group hired Sudafi Henry, who previously <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=81196">served</a> as Biden’s director of legislative affairs when Biden was vice president. </p>
<p>Henry lobbied Congress on behalf of the association in the <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/eeb948ce-6ba0-4072-9f26-e7b262e37d58/print/">last month of 2020</a>. Then, once Biden took office, he began directly lobbying the executive office of the president on “issues involving COVID-19 relief,” according to <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/ce38d060-f47b-4e7e-b506-0feb45a32968/print/">lobbying disclosures</a>.</p>
<p>Henry’s lobbying firm, theGROUP, did not respond to <em>The Daily Poster’s</em> request for comment.</p>

<p>One month before the 2020 presidential election, candidate <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2020/10/07/biden-affirms-i-will-eliminate-your-student-debt/?sh=1e9d60af58a7">Joe Biden told</a> a young person at a town hall, “I’m going to eliminate your student debt if you come from a family [making less] than $125,000 and went to a public university.”</p>
<p>Now, half a year later, Biden is failing to deliver even minimal student debt relief. His proposed budget <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/05/21/white-house-biden-health/">is expected to</a> omit any student debt relief at all. As <em>The Daily Poster</em> reported in February, this <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1396125597059846146?s=20">shouldn’t come</a> as a surprise: Biden has had a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/otherposts/biden-and-student-debt-a-40-year-029/">decades-long love affair</a> with debt — in particular, student debt.</p>

    <li><strong>LYFT WANTS DRIVERS TO LOBBY AGAINST THEMSELVES: </strong>The ride-sharing company Lyft <a href="https://twitter.com/markgrueter/status/1396851240450023425?s=20">has a new campaign</a> to recruit drivers as lobbyists against laws that would classify gig workers as employees rather than as independent contractors, meaning their employers would have to provide them benefits and more job security. In 2020, California <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/tech/california-proposition-22/index.html">voters passed</a> a ballot measure that exempted ride-share companies from classifying their drivers as employees, following massive spending on the measure from Lyft and Uber. Since then, Lyft and Uber have been undertaking campaigns across the country to prevent other states from requiring them to classify their drivers as employees, including in New York state, as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-blue-state-campaign-to-crush-gig-workers/"><em>The Daily Poster</em> reported</a> this morning.</li>

Now, faced with more revenue than expected, states are toeing the line on the provision, forcing Biden’s Treasury Department to decide whether it will act to prevent federal aid from underwriting corporate subsidies. “Nebraska approved a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ne-state-wire-nebraska-business-government-and-politics-3bc3c849fcdb0fe580e9b3a5bda3baa9">$26 million</a> corporate tax cut last week, and lawmakers <a href="https://omaha.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/could-nebraskas-proposed-tax-cuts-be-blocked-by-federal-covid-relief-bill/article_960c6cb8-8368-11eb-b3bc-770821f10e69.html">told <em>The Omaha World-Herald</em></a> that they believe that by keeping the federal funds in a separate account from the state’s general fund, they will be in compliance with the law,” <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/business/economy/republicans-biden-infrastructure-federal-aid.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">reports</a>.</li>
