<p>The group gets into how the film portrays Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as a sharp-witted outcast, even though the real-life Zuckerberg is best described as, ‚Äúif vanilla pudding was annoying.‚Äù They also break down the film‚Äôs misogynistic gender politics, the Aaron Sorkin-ness of it all, and whether or not ordering two rounds of appletinis is worse than being Larry Summers. </p>
