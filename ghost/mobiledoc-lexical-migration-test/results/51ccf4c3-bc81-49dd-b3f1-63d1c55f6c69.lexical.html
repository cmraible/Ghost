<p>Fans of the classic manga/anime <em>Death Note</em> will likely enjoy the premise of <em>Death and Taxes. </em>You are a grim reaper and your sole purpose is to decide who lives and who dies. The air of bureaucracy and the dialogue adds some humor and lightens the morbid mood. <em>Death and Taxes</em> is one of the most unique games I've played this year. To live or die? That is the choice.</p>

<p>In all likelihood you'll blow through <em>Death and Taxes</em> in a day or two, but the experience in a memorable one. Your decisions matter and even though you're given directions on how to choose your victims, you can ignore them if you choose. <em>Death and Taxes </em>is a hilarious take on life, death and society. As this game is almost entirely text based, the care that went into writing the dialogue and character descriptions are really where this game shines. This Kafka-esque title is sure to delight avid readers but there isn't much appeal for more action-oriented gamers as all the death and destruction occurs off-screen. </p>
