<hr>
<p>A lot of people go wild over classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/mustang-mayhem-ponies-on-the-parkway/">Ford Mustangs</a>, especially the fastbacks and convertibles. They love the look of the pony car as well as the good memories it triggers. That said, this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1972-ford-mustang/">1972 Ford Mustang</a> Convertible we found on eBay admittedly isn’t from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-shelby-gt350-icon/">the most desirable model year</a>. Still, this one has some things going for it, especially the fact it likely won’t go for some ludicrous price.</p>

<p>If you’re still reading you might have <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/collecting-cars-open-mind/">an open mind</a> for this kind of Mustang. Now to get into the good about this pony car. The seller says it’s original and looking at it that certainly seems to be the case. While it’s original, it’s not in the best condition, with some rust spots, a hole in the backseat, trim removed (but it looks like the owner kept it all), and many other issues which will need to be corrected. Even the paint, which is going to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/barn-find-1969-road-runner/">need some serious work</a> if you don’t decide to just sandblast and start over, is apparently factory-original.</p>

<p>This Mustang has some nice equipment, like power steering and power disc brakes. We’re not wild about the automatic transmission, but for some that’s a plus. Also, it has the 302ci V8, which isn’t as desirable as the 351 but it’s better than the 250.</p>

<p>Even though there’s rust, the seller says it’s only on the surface and in limited areas. With no photos of the chassis you don’t really know what’s going on down below. The ad does admit this car has a “tiny bit” of a transmission leak, with the current owner saying it probably needs a new gasket. While the top works, the cloth has had it, so you’ll have to spring to replace that.</p>

<p>In the listing the current owner says they bought this 1972 Ford Mustang from the original owner. Why they’re selling it is a mystery, but that might be a good thing for you. The only question is if you would bid on this pony or not?</p>
