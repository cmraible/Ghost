Back in 1971 that wasn’t the case, and that makes watching the dealer film pretty entertaining. It comes from Chrysler, so it’s just slightly biased in favor of the Plymouths."

It’s bigger in just about every way, plus the windshield wipers are hidden and there’s a new Sportsroof body style the Blue Oval really wanted everyone to believe had true European styling flair. Everyone has an opinion on that and everything else about the changes to the Mustang, and now you get to hear Chrysler’s take. It’s time to get out the bucket of popcorn and enjoy the film."
