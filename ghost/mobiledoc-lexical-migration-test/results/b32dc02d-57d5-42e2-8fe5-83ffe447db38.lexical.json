Both deliver power through all four of their wheels, both are significantly lighter than their factory counterparts, and they’re pretty close on power. The major difference is that one is a Honda Civic and the other is a 2019 Ford F150 known as the Gator. The Honda is pushing out about 900 hp or the Gator has around 1000. Probably the biggest advantage that the Civic has is it’s incredibly lightweight, sitting in it just around 2,500 pounds. Compared to the 4,500 pound truck, this may prove to be an easy win but there is the implicit torque that comes with the 5.2 L V8 in the Gator.",

As predicted, the Civic took off from the line and seemingly left the truck in the dust. However, the truck quickly caught up but eventually lost by 1 1/2 car lengths. Clearly, the Civic was in for a lot more than previously anticipated. Round two was a completely different story with the Civic taking a massive loss and a punch in the gut both to the car and his ego. Needless to say, the truck wiped the floor with her body in the Civic which made round three highly anticipated.",

In round one, he admitted that he jumped the line because he knew that would be the only way he could beat the truck so they wanted to see what it would be like when applied to medium well that was allowed. Surprisingly enough, the truck still beat the Civic by about the same amount the Civic beat the Gator in the first round by cheating. So, it seems like either we have a situation where yet another Honda Civic owner thinks they can do a lot more than they can or this truck is built to the moon and back with a ton of extra mods we don’t know about. Either way, it seems like American muscle truck engineering wins this one.",
