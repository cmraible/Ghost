Some people complained that these cars were too “nice” or not connected enough to the original GT350Rs, missing that they’re marvelous track cars and could’ve taken the Mustang in a little different direction. It wasn’t to be and production has no ceased, so we predict in several years or so when people realize what these really were all about, prices will skyrocket.",

One is the ’46 Ford Custom with a flathead V8 and a chrome chassis. It’s a beautiful car which got a fair amount of screen time. Then there’s the ’33 Ford Custom, which was the first hotrod built for the TV show. Allen says he learned a lot about hot rods through this car, although it sounds like he would build it differently if he had it all to do over again.",
