Heads and shoulders, no knees and toes, a bold strategy, but one I can surely appreciate. Fields littered with corpses can get a bit cumbersome and, while it does play on that German folklore that I do so adore, the only gripe is that it somewhat divulges into its greyed out colour palette to boot. I get it - it's a grim, war experience. It's a little depressing and moody, but "

The wooden board with the yellow text atop clashes while the font feels generic fantasy and uninspired. In-game, when you're not perusing the back of chopping boards with chalk scrawled across them, there's a nice pastel feel to the world that has it feeling like a painting placed on a table with some board game pieces slopped on top. To clarify, that's a good thing, and the hexagonal layout only makes it all the better. Still, the UX feels a touch cluttered and early 2000s, but there's a charm to it."

Luckily, those expectations were immediately proven wrong, and within hours of lying in bed, starring at my Switch, wondering where the time went, I discovered a fantastic must-have.
