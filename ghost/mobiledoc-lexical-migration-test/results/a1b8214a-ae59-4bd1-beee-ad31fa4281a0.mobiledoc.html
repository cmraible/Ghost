<p>Let us introduce you to Leonard Leo, who is single-handedly more responsible for the Supreme Court’s conservative majority than anyone else in politics.</p>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IrEQ0M0M8o">latest video demonstrates</a>, anti-abortion activist Leonard Leo built a dark-money network that helped shape the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority, and then <a href="__GHOST_URL__/dark-money-went-in-supreme-court-rulings-are-coming-out/">brought them the tools</a> to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>
<p>Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IrEQ0M0M8o">new video</a> about how he did it — then share it on social media.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/koch-machine-pressing-supreme-court-to-crush-epa/">this</a> and <a href="https://contextly.com/redirect/?id=O5YgKX40rY:62b3abb5e242ed004d82d5ff:9081:18:RVM=::previous:62d712a97be352-07376420'">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.</p>
