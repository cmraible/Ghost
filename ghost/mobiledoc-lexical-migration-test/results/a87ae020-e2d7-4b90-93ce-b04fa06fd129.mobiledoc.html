<p>Pretty much every enthusiast knows about the legend of the 1987 Buick GNX. It took the Grand National platform to another level and is now one of the most sought-after Buicks among collectors. However, few are aware of McLaren’s tie to the car or exactly how it differs from the Grand National. Learn a little more about the GNX and watch a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/retro-review-trans-ams/">MotorWeek</a> review from when the car was new.</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1987-buick-gnx-remained-unsold/">How has this</a> Buick Grand National GNX remained unsold after decades?</em></blockquote>
<p>If you look at a GNX, the exterior is almost completely identical to a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1987-buick-grand-national/">Grand National</a>, other than the front fender ports. When it comes to the interior, it’s pretty much the same was what you get in a Grand National. The glaring difference is the gauges many complained about in the GN were swapped for analog units from Stewart-Warner for the GNX.</p>

<p>But, when it comes to mechanicals, there’s a huge difference between the two. Bolted up to the 3.8-liter V6 is a larger turbocharger with a modified intercooler. Ported and polished cylinder heads take advantage of the additional forced induction. To maximize that power boost, Buick installed a new computer chip and higher-flow exhaust. This resulted in a factory-rated 300-horsepower and 380 lb.-ft. of torque. This was a big deal for 1987 and MotorWeek shows its enthusiasm in the review.</p>
<p>That special powertrain was modified for Buick by ASC/McLaren, so it really is special. The reason Buick went all-out for the GNW was that it marked the end of the road for the Regal, so the brand wanted it to go out with a big bang.</p>
<p>GM marketed this halo car aggressively, going so far in one ad to say it was “B-B-Bad to the Bone.” Instead of a lot of hype for nothing special, what Buick was selling is even today considered one of the most desirable Buicks ever made.</p>
<p>As MotorWeek notes, the 1987 Buick GNX was expensive for its time with MSRP of $29,290. That sounds like not a lot for our time, especially when you see the small fortune these cars sell for today. Since only 500 were made, GNXs aren’t exactly sitting around all over America.</p>

<p>Even though the GNX nameplate has never returned to the Buick lineup, despite <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/modern-buick-grand-national/">rumors in recent years</a> that it was coming back, this model has had a lasting effect on the muscle car scene. It emerged at a time when many were declaring American performance was dead, proving them wrong and helping to fuel a resurgence of muscle in the USA.</p>
