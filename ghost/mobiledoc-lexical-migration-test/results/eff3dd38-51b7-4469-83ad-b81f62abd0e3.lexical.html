<h3 id="classic-design-meets-modern-engineering-this-corvette-is-a-homage-to-the-iconic-c2">Classic design meets modern engineering. This Corvette is a homage to the iconic C2.</h3>
<p>Classic cars offer us the opportunity to step back in time and relive an era of motoring that was free from the constraints of modern legislation. Their inspirational designs are much missed and are far harder to emulate in the modern-day. Or are they? This custom Corvette proves that you can indeed have the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>This pretty unique Corvette is currently listed in our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167216/2008-chevrolet-corvette-karl-kustom-convertible">classifieds</a> and at first glance you’d be forgiven for thinking it was a C2 model. An extensive body kit has transformed a 2008 model into something much more akin to the iconic sports car generation. All of the hallmarks are there including those defined creases, tasteful chrome, and pop-up headlights. Obviously the proportions have needed to be lengthened, but it’s an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/167216/2008-chevrolet-corvette-karl-kustom-convertible">impressive homage</a> by Karl Kustom Corvettes.</p>

<p>The interior brings you back to the present-day, resembling that of the base car — no bad thing. Two-tone leather sports seats hold you in place while you enjoy today’s luxuries such as air conditioning and a touchscreen infotainment display.</p>

<p>Hiding beneath the impressive craftsmanship of the custom body, is a potent Corvette chassis that plays host to an LS3 V8 engine. This aluminum block 430-horsepower and 428 lb/ft of torque, all sent to the rear wheels. 0-60mph is pegged at about four seconds thanks to a responsive automatic transmission, making this one mean machine.</p>
<p>The advert boats that ‘state-of-the-art’ Wilwood brakes arrest this car’s progress without hesitation, and the car’s cornering abilities are impressive thanks to ‘racing-bred suspension.’ Its these impressive modern Corvette attributes, fused with classic styling, that makes for such a unique proposition.</p>
