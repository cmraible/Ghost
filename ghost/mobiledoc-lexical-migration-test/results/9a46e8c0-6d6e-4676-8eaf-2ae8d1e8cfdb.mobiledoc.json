The only problem was the guy really stretched his Chevy’s legs on Port Moody Highway in British Columbia instead of finding a track with a long straightaway. The whole incident came to a screeching halt when a police officer pulled the guy over."

For those who know the metric system is a tool of the devil, that’s about 96 mph in a 50 mph zone, which admittedly is pretty stupid. We don’t recommend doing this at all."

Sure, the guy had to pay the fine in Canadian dollars and they only impounded his sports car for 7 days, but that’s still money he could’ve spent on something better. We don’t think it was worth the thrill he got for driving so fast."

Those incidents can lead to a serious accident, meaning the driver picks up even more citations, the car might be totaled, and they’re definitely going to jail. The best thing to do is just stay to the speed limit and avoid the fines."
