Equipped with a Mutha Thumpr camshaft and Stage 1 fuel injection, this big classic roars to life under throttle. Other highlights include a cold air intake, a clean induction system, bright-colored valve covers, and an aluminum radiator with an electric fan. Power is shifted down to the wheels thanks to a 4L60E automatic transmission with overdrive. Added rumble comes from a Flowmaster dual exhaust, and a heavy-duty suspension keeps handling in check. Navigating comes easy thanks to power steering and front power disc brakes.",
