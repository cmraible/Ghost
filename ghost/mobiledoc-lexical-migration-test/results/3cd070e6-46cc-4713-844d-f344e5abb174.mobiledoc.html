<p>While a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">hot rod</a> certainly will turn heads, not nearly as many people have a tractor from the early 50s. We certainly don’t get many of these, but they’re interesting and overall simple machines. What’s great is the conversion to a 12-volt electrical system has already been done, eliminating a very real fire risk and modernizing this Super C for more reliable enjoyment.</p>

<p>According to the seller, the engine fires up and runs well, so you can immediately start enjoying this tractor. The tires are also supposed to be free or damage and have sufficient tread, which you can see well enough in the pictures.</p>
<p>Overall, the cosmetic condition of this tractor isn’t half bad. The red paint makes it look like a true classic, plus with some elbow grease it looks like it might shine up nicely. The matching red wheels don’t look like they have any damage, while the seat, steering wheel, lights, and other equipment all appear to be in good condition.</p>

<p>This is a tricycle-style tractor like what you’d picture would be on a family farm after WWII. It’s easy to paint a picture of pastoral tranquility just looking at this International Harvester. You’re getting a slice of Americana, something which should be lovingly preserved for future generations. Plus you might be in the position to put this tractor to work.</p>
