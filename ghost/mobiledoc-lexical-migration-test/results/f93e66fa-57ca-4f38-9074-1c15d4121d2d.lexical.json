They unveiled a 1969 Camaro along with a blue classic Mustang. When all was said and done, the Battle Of The Builders was won by a 1948 Chevy truck. Even by the exterior you can tell the vehicle has had a ton of work put into it and now it will forever be respected as a legend in automotive history. Overall, this year’s SEMA was a blast and it’s going to be crazy to see what builders come up with next year to top it.",
