<p>It finally happened. <em>Anyone </em>can drive traffic from Instagram stories. Up until recently, only accounts with over 10,000 followers — a high bar for smaller titles to reach — could access the “upwards swipe to open a link” gesture in Instagram. The same held true for the link sticker that replaced it. And then, a couple of weeks ago, people started losing access to the link sticker.</p>
<p>Now we know why: Instagram was implementing a major transition — <a href="Klaus Papenbrock">it's available to everyone</a>. sFinally, smaller publishers have an option beyond “link in bio” to try and get some traffic out of the roach motel that is the 'gram.</p>
<p>And, based on my testing, it works…</p>

<p>So, head into Instagram and choose the stories option. Click on the stickers icon, and you get this:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/link-sticker-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1170" height="2532" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/link-sticker-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/link-sticker-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/link-sticker-1.jpg 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Hit the link sticker, and you get an URL field: </p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8754-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1166" height="809" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/IMG_8754-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/IMG_8754-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8754-1.jpg 1166w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Obviously, your best bet is copying and pasting from the url of the page you want to link. I found this process a little temperamental — hopefully that will be ironed out. And so you get:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8755-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1155" height="741" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/IMG_8755-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/IMG_8755-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8755-1.jpg 1155w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Click “Done” and you get the link sticker. The text doesn't seem to be customisable right now — it always shows the root domain of the URL you're linking to. And it looks like this:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/link-sticker-in-use-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1170" height="2532" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/link-sticker-in-use-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/link-sticker-in-use-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/link-sticker-in-use-1.jpg 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Obviously, you can combine it with other stickers to “sell” the click a little more:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide">
    <div class="kg-gallery-container">
        <div class="kg-gallery-row">
            <div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8757-1.jpg" width="1170" height="2532" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/IMG_8757-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/IMG_8757-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8757-1.jpg 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div>
            <div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8758-1.jpg" width="1170" height="2532" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/IMG_8758-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/IMG_8758-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/IMG_8758-1.jpg 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div>
        </div>

<p>And there we have it! A real genuine chance for those of us outside the 10,000 follow club to generate traffic from the ’gram — and, most importantly, a chance to take some of that community we've developed on the ’gram and bring it into owned and operated spaces.</p>
<h3 id="cross-posting-to-facebook">Cross-posting to Facebook</h3>
<p>Cross-posting Stories to Facebook <em>does</em> work, with the link preserved in the Facebook version of the Story — in my experience at least. I've seen at least one report of it not working — so it might be worth double-checking. Sometimes when Meta (uggh) rolls out a feature like this, it takes time for all Facebook and Instagram accounts to be updated to support it.</p>
<p>Certainly, my expectation is that this <em>will</em> work cross-app, as that seems consistent with the company's approach of building a common backend to its platforms.</p>
<p>So, there we are. One of the biggest complaints about Instagram <em>finally</em> addressed. Would it be nice to have links in the grid? Of course! But this opens up the possibility of driving traffic from the 'gram to your site for everyone — and that changes the audience engagement dynamic considerably.</p>

<p>If you or your team do something particularly successful with the new link stickers, I'd <em>love</em> to hear about it.</p>
