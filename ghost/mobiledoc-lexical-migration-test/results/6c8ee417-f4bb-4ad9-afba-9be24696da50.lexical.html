<p>General Motors can claim the fame of people the driver behind the original muscle car, the Olds Rocket 88 back in the 1950s, but they were really boiling by the late 1960s. Finding that absolute recipe for success, GM dominated the American performance car market for many years, and some of the most iconic and collectible ones were made at the end of the 1960s. At the upcoming Maple Brothers OKC Auction, three amazing GM muscle cars from 1969 are going to be up for grabs, will you give one of these cars a new home?</p>
