<p>Painted in an attention-grabbing Bolero Red paint with white racing stripes, this <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/30843/1967-chevrolet-camaro-z28??utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">old school Z28</a> is going to turn heads wherever it goes. Under the hood rests a rare 302 cubic-inch V8 a limited production engine for this year model Camaro. Inside the 11:1 compression engine is a set of forged pistons, a special solid lifter cam, and the big valve heads have 2.02-inch intake and 1.60-inch exhaust valves.

<p>Backing the engine is a Muncie 4-speed transmission, that feeds into a 3.73:1 ratio rear end. A dual exhaust with deep tone mufflers gives <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/30843/1967-chevrolet-camaro-z28??utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Camaro</a> it's all American muscle car growl. A heavy duty suspension with traction arm help you control it, and it gets stopped power from disc brakes. </p>
