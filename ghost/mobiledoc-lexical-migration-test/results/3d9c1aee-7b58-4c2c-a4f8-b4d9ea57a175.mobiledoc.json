Even though they’ve all been watered down by corporate meddling, the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the potential Build Back Better framework all promise significant government investment in progressive priorities, from an expanded social safety net to much-needed climate action. President Joe Biden also pulled the country out of the Afghanistan quagmire and has significantly cut back military drone strikes. So why does it feel like the Biden presidency is such a colossal failure?"

There is also a sense that however much in control of the federal government progressives may be, the right is still calling the shots. The first point is inarguable, especially when it comes to climate change and inequality. The second point is questionable, but it can find confirmation in everything from a conservative Supreme Court supermajority to the right’s ability to unleash one debilitating culture war after another — and in the growing fear that Republicans will ride back into the halls of power and slam the doors of democracy behind them, maybe forever.”"

The Dogwood Alliance estimates that sixty thousand acres of trees — trees that would have otherwise sequestered carbon — are burned each year to supply the growing pellet market. Global demand for wood pellets is expected to double by 2027, to more than thirty-six million tons. And although the entire premise of burning wood as renewable energy hinges on the assumption that trees grow back, there is no binding governmental or industrial oversight for replanting trees at all. ‘There’s no requirement that Drax or anyone has to replant trees, and no requirement that whatever they’re planting has to come back as natural forest,’ Quaranda said.\""

He had never set foot in the Middle East, unless you count the time he changed planes in Dubai en route to Manila, or his trip to visit his in-laws in Turkey. Yet in the 18 months since Higgins had begun blogging about Syria, his barebones site, Brown Moses, had become the foremost source of information on the weapons used in Syria's deadly war. Using nothing more sophisticated than an Asus laptop, he had uncovered evidence of weapons imported into Syria from Iran. He had been the first person to identify widely-banned cluster bombs deployed by Syrian forces. By"

He and his comrades are populist culture warriors, cohered as much by temperament as ideology—and by certain fiercely held enmities. Some are ‘national conservatives,’ who, like ‘Reformicons’ of the 2010s, support pro-family welfare policy and reject the GOP’s tax-cutting orthodoxy. (NatCons, as they’re known, also tend to be China and immigration hawks who want an “industrial policy” for the heartland.)

The possibility still pops up now and then in various forms, prompting a series of questions about how the movement would take hold within a team and what the NCAA would do in reaction. To this point, nobody’s tested the theory in real life.”"

In the first year of the agreement, a ski-lift landing situated in Italy suddenly found itself on Swiss soil. Subsequent land shifts have consisted of uninhabited terrain, scattered plots of rock and scree about a few hundred feet long. The moving border has not run into any people or commerce, with one exception: the Rifugio Guide del Cervino, a traditional mountain lodge in the Pennine Alps. It’s situated on the edge of the Testa Grigia peak, atop a cliff that drops off toward Italy and descends into Switzerland on the other side. The building itself may be located in Italy, Switzerland, or both.”"
