There's going to be a lot of talk about the interior of this coupe, but first, take a moment to appreciate the exterior.  With a premium fashion name like Pierre Cardin attached to this coupe, the exterior looks like formalwear.  After all, black and white make this like a tuxedo.  The factory-correct Snow White was resprayed later in life to make sure it remains looking crisp."

It's finished in its correct one-year color, and it's also loaded with features.  So it makes for a rare, speedy, and all-around desirable collectible. The Purple Haze paint is a seldom-seen color.  It was made available only on the 1992 car, and this was the final year for the 3rd generation Camaro.  The Z03 in the trim tag tells us that this is a true Heritage Edition model celebrating the 25th anniversary.  Are you starting to understand the distinction here?  When you combine all of its unique elements, this Z/28 is believed to be one of only 55 ever made.  The special paint was resprayed later in life to still have a proper shine while also having the aged-in look of a survivor."
