<h3 id="this-viper-is-a-bald-eagle-eating-apple-pie-on-the-fourth-of-july">This Viper is a bald eagle eating apple pie on the Fourth of July.</h3>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/super-plymouth-cuda-uses-viper-power/">Dodge Viper</a> always complemented its brutal supercar power with the stunning looks of a concept car, and this beautiful <a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/vehicles/180/2006-dodge-viper-gts?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe</a> is a perfect example of both. The 2006 model year marked the introduction of the second-gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/pcarmarket-hosts-virtual-scottsdale/" rel="nofollow noopener">Viper</a> coupe – now called the SRT-10 Coupe instead of the GTS – but it still had an instantly recognizable shape with the double-bubble roof mixed with the available Viper GTS Blue paint and wide, white racing stripes.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, <a href="https://www.gtmotorcarsllc.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">GT Motor Cars</a> has this amazing, low-mileage 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe listed for sale.</p>

<p>Many Vipers have been extensively modified and/or abused over the years, so it isn't very common to see one in as good of condition as this SRT-10 Coupe. This 2006 Dodge Viper has had just two owners in its lifetime, and it is showing less than 7,200 miles on the odometer. While it might look like a stock Viper from the outside, this SRT-10 is hiding a big secret under the hood.</p>
<p>Strapped to the front of the Viper's 8.3-liter V10 engine is almost $10,000 worth of Paxton Supercharger power. According to Paxton, this unit increases the standard output of the Viper (510 horsepower and 535 lb-ft of torque) up to 700 horsepower and 633 lb-ft of torque on 7-8 psi of boost. That's more than enough to give this venomous Viper even more bite!</p>
