<hr>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago there was a growing narrative that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/livestreams-fatal-crash/">car theft doesn’t really harm anyone</a> since all cars are insured. That was obviously a dumb argument on so many levels, but it’s that kind of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/minneapolis-police-chief-frustrated-with-car-theft/">lackadaisical stance</a> toward car theft which has helped fuel the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/colorados-car-theft-problem/">out-of-control inferno</a> raging in many cities now. A recent hit-and-run police say was done by two men in a Kia they stole a few days before perfectly illustrates how car theft affects everyone.</p>

<p>Sadly, Kias as well as Hyundais have become hot theft magnets. Sure, most aren’t worth that much on the market, but they can be easy to boost. Thieves don’t just sell cars they steal, but sometimes use them to commit other crimes or just to have fun.</p>
<p>In the case of this Kia, which was stolen on the night of April 9 while it sat in a Memphis, Tennessee apartment complex parking lot, it turned up again on April 12 after the two men inside hit another car, then took off. When officers caught up with the suspects, one was found with a handgun stolen in Las Cruces, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Officers found screw drivers and a USB charging cable on the other guy. Those are tools thieves use to steal Kias and Hyundais that lack an engine immobilizer. That’s partly what makes those vehicles so easy to swipe and popular targets.</p>
<p>While these two suspects were caught, one was immediately released, according to a local report from Fox 13. The other had his bond set at $35,000. Unfortunately, many car thieves go right back to stealing once they’re no longer in custody, especially if they’re part of a theft ring.</p>
<p>Even if you never have your car stolen by thieves, you could still fall victim to their activity as they drive recklessly in stolen cars and have a general disregard for the safety and well-being of others. Plus, all this car theft is helping fuel rising insurance premiums, car parts shortages, and other crimes.</p>
