<h3 id="a-classic-camaro-and-mustang-were-lifted-from-a-rural-connecticut-property">A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/auction-coolest-camaros/">classic Camaro</a> and Mustang were lifted from a rural Connecticut property.</h3>
<p>You'd think that nestling a collection of classic cars on a 144-acre <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/farm-truck-turned-racing-boat/">farm</a> should keep them protected from thieves, but sadly that isn't the case for two iconic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/own-drive-crush-90s-pony-cars/">pony cars</a>. The Connecticut State Police are searching for a 1966 Ford Mustang and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1969-camaro-auction/">1969 Chevrolet Camaro</a> that were stolen from a 234-year-old farm in Voluntown, CT at some point between November 2018 and March 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Classic-cars-Mustang-and-Camaro-stolen-from-CT-13983027.php#item-85307-tbla-3">According to police</a>, these two cars were in a "Big barn where [the owner] stored a number of antique vehicles," and while there was no video surveillance or security system in place, the owner says that only a few people knew about the cache of collectable cars. Sadly, the cars are only visited a few times a year making it easier for the thieves to hide their tracks, but the good news is that both of these cars are highly sought after and should be easy to spot to discerning eyes â€“ assuming they haven't been parted out by now.</p>

<p>Judging from pictures, the Mustang and Camaro seem to be in great shape, and both appear to be restored clones since the VIN indicates both are original six-cylinder cars. This is likely backed up by the fact that the investigating trooper states that the owner of the cars "makes most of his cars from scratch."</p>
<p>The 1966 Ford Mustang (VIN: 6R07T234185) wears a dark green paint job, and it looks to be a GT clone with incorrect "302" badges on the front fenders since the '66 Mustang GT had a 289 CID V-8. The 1969 Chevrolet Camaro (VIN: 123379L525269) is painted orange with a body and badging of a Camaro <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-chevy-chevelle-ss-clone/">SS clone</a>. If you have any information about either of these vehicles, please contact Connecticut State Trooper Josh Bowyer Troop E Montville at 860-848-6500.</p>
