<p>New research highlights the depressing amount of abuse local journalists face:</p>
<blockquote>The most common platform for abuse is Facebook, with 89% of respondents receiving abuse on this platform. For Twitter, it’s 67%. Eighty per cent say they receive abuse in the comments sections of their newspaper websites.</blockquote>
<p>Three thoughts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The fact that Facebook is the biggest problem should dispell the old myth that doing away with anonymity woule resolve trolling problems</li>
    <li>As ever, don't have a comment section if you're not prepared to manage it. (Drive-by politcial abuse is one of the reasons I've restriced commenting here to signed-in subscribers. Try it! ⬇️)</li>
    <li>I remain concerned that, as local journalists become ever more distant from the communities they serve, this is only going to get worse. </li>

<p>Facebook has shifted its emphasis towards groups since the Facepocalyse of a few years back, and some publishers have been doing good things in them. But they've also become a festering incubator for misinformation and polarisation. I'm sceptical about how much difference this will make, as Facebook is a master at over-promising and under-delivering, but it might impact anyone running group-based communities. </p>
<h2 id="wordpress-stories">WordPress Stories</h2>
<p>Remember when the stories format, as pioneered by Snapchat and cloned by Facebook properties, was all the rage? That seems ancient history now people are obsessing over Reels and TikTok. However, Google has been slowly working to bring that general format to the web, and you can now give it a try if you have a WordPress site:</p>

<h2 id="taking-discourse-off-substack">Taking Discourse off SubStack</h2>
<p>A counterpoint to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/09/casey-newton-leaves-verge-for-substack/">yesterday's piece</a>, and in particular my worries about Substack becoming a single point of failure for independent journalism: <em>Discourse</em> is leaving SubStack and relaunching on a WordPress-based stack, facilitated <a href="https://joinlede.com">by Lede</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth watching how this goes, but it's worth noting that SubStack is still very much a newsletter platform, with a web presence as an afterthough. It's not — yet — a good home for more sophisticated offerings. </p>
