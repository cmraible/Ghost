<h2 id="keywords">Keywords</h2>
<p>Keywords are still a basic part of how Google understands the meaning of a page, even as they’ve been de-emphasised in favour of trying to understand the implicit question or problem in your search query. They are not the be all and end all of SEO they used to be, and using the same keyword too often, or putting lots of keywords into hidden parts of the page, is a tactic known as “keyword stuffing” that will now <em>hurt</em> your search ranking, not aid it.</p>
<p>Technically, these days we're actually focusing on “entities” — <a href="https://www.infront.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-entity-seo-an-introduction-to-entity-based-seo/#:~:text=According%20to%20Google%2C%20an%20SEO,date%2C%20currency%2C%20or%20idea.">specific things or concepts Google recognises</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of thumb</strong>: if your level of keyword usage feels unnatural to a reader, you’ve gone too far.</p>

<h3 id="finding-keywords">Finding keywords</h3>
<p>If you’re a decent journalist, you should know what your story is about - and thus, what the keywords are. The question to ask yourself is: “What would people type into a search engine if they wanted to know more about this subject?”</p>
<p>There is one great way of testing your guess or guesses - and checking if people are searching for what you think they are. Google provides a way of fining out what volume of people are searching for a particular term</p>
<h3 id="tool-google-trends">Tool: Google Trends</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> allows you to do comparative analysis of search volumes for several words or phrases. It’s the single most useful tool in your arsenal. Sometimes people search on different phrases to the ones we assume they will. For instance, this is the result you get when you compare “climate crisis” and “climate change”:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-at-13.00.38.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1100" height="734" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-at-13.00.38.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-at-13.00.38.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-at-13.00.38.png 1100w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
<p>Despite the fact that “climate crisis” has been the preferred term for some years, “climate change” still gets more search volume.</p>
<p>You can customise your results by time or location using the drop-down menus on the page.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4359582?hl=en">advanced search modifiers</a>, to remove some items. For example, here’s a search for the new (and possibly short-lived) political party Change UK, with clocks and time removed:</p>
<h3 id="tool-google-search-console">Tool: Google Search Console</h3>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">incredibly useful service</a> - but you might need to work with your tech people to get it up and running for you. The “add a site” walkthrough will help you with that. It has a tool showing you what keywords your site is ranking for already. However - Google is downplaying direct targeting of keywords. Less and less keyword data is being disclosed over time. The keyword’s role as the centre of SEO is eroding.</p>
<h3 id="hummingbird-and-natural-language-search">Hummingbird and natural language search</h3>
<p>In late 2013, Google released the Hummingbird update which rebuilt its search engine to be more contextual and to give better results for “natural language” queries - the sorts you would speak into your phone rather than type into a search box. This reflects the growing importance of mobile. Increasingly. “what question does this page answer?” or “what problem does this page solve?” is as important - or more so - than just targeting keywords. This has been supplemented by <a href="http://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-new-google-rankbrain-algorithm-234440">RankBrain, a machine learning algorithm</a>, that tries to clarify “fuzzy” searches. It’s now the third most important factor in searches.</p>
<p>The most recent change as of late 2019 is the introduction of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), more machine learning, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90422132/google-just-got-better-at-understanding-your-trickiest-searches">designed to give more nuance</a> in understanding queries. They described this as the biggest change for five years.</p>
<h3 id="tool-google-keyword-planner-tool">Tool: Google Keyword Planner Tool</h3>
<p>Designed for choosing the best keywords for ad placement, the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS&__u=9813732924&__c=3521538264">AdWords keyword tool</a> is also useful at finding alternative keywords that might be more useful - or more searched for - than the one you were thinking of. However, you will need to sign up for a free AdWords account to access it. It also gives you actual search volumes, unlike Google Trends.</p>

    <li>The headline, and any sub-headings (as long as these are properly marked up as <h1>, <h2>, etc).</li>
    <li>As close as you can to the start of the first paragraph</li>
    <li>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute">Alt text</a> for photographs, and in the photograph’s file name</li>
    <li>In the basename for the article’s URL.

The targeted keywords - seo and content - both appear early on.</li>

<p>Since Google’s Panda update five years ago, the search engine takes a view on the inherent quality of your pages. Here’s how <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html">Google describes the signals of a high-quality piece of content</a>.</p>
