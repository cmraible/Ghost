Among the factors you should look for is limited-production cars or the final generation of enthusiast-favorite features like a V8 engine or gated shifter. The experts interviewed called out some cars which we see as being extremely good investments here in North America, like any Porsche 911 or BMWs from the 80s and 90s, Mercedes-Benz coupes and convertibles, plus Japanese sports cars from the 90s.",

The same can be said for real estate, wine, or stocks since there’s always a risk involved, otherwise there would be little to no investment reward on the backend. That said, it looks like classic cars will stay hot for some time.",
