<p>Although unconfirmed, reliable sources say that the three occupants inside the wagon were not wearing seatbelts. Sources also said that Crampton suffered a broken hip after he was ejected from the car, and they said that Lagana is in critical condition after suffering life-threatening injuries from the accident and is currently on a ventilator. There was another person in the vehicle, 30-year-old Jake Sanders, who is being treated at a nearby hospital for his injuries.</p>
<p>Reports say that Lagana was driving the '57 Chevy southbound on County Road 1000 East on a section between the raceway and a campground located west of the track when the accident happened. For reasons unknown, the wagon restomod went off the west side of the road and made contact with a utility pole, as mentioned above. According to Captain Amanda Goings from the Hendricks County Sheriff's Office, the wreck is still being investigated but speed is believed to have been a big factor.</p>
<p>Just this past weekend the '57 Chevy station wagon made an appearance at the NHRA Dodge Indy Nationals where it was towing Lindberg's Top Alcohol Funny Car behind it. Both Lagana and Sanders are crew members Top Fuel dragsters for Steve and Billy Torrence.</p>
