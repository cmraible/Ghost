<p>After returning the fortune cookie to Jin, he will tell you to go to the Sanctuary in Lupia. So head there and speak to Sister Abigoat.</p>

<p>Sister Abigoat will say that you have to find three relics and give you a few hints about finding each relic:</p>
<p>“THE GRAND SKY WHERE BIRDS AND CLOUDS FREELY DRIFT,”</p>
<p>“CLEAR WATERS NEAR SKULL ISLAND’S OMINOUS GAZE,”</p>
<p>“THE DEEP WOODS WHERE THE MOST VENOMOUS OF CREATURES DWELL.”</p>
<p>Once Sister Abigoat is finished, she’ll pray and you’ll be given the Morning Star. This comes in handy as it allows us to break big blocks.</p>

<p>So from all of that, I think we can gather roughly which areas we need to go, so let’s find them!</p>
<h2>Relic #1</h2>
<p>The grand sky obviously refers to the Village of Aeria, so let’s make our way up there. We can’t use our Teleport Rod here in the Village of Lupia, but we just have to go up the elevator to get there. Simple!</p>
<p>We want to go all the way to the top to where Sir. Hoots is… you know, where we just came from, and then cross the bridge to the left.</p>

<p>Now put that Morning Star to good use and destroy those blocks!</p>

<p>With this puzzle, you need to use the frog in order to rotate one of the three circles by using its tongue on the + in the centre. You can then use the pig or lion to ground-pound the button on the left in order to change which circle you’re rotating. The aim is to align the stars so that they resemble the great hero (that’s you!) holding his sword skyward…</p>

<p>Now the wall will open allowing you to grab the first relic!</p>
<h2>Relic #2</h2>
<p>For the second Relic, head to this frame in Skullrock Beach…</p>

<p>As you walk up, there are three doors, each with their own challenges and rules. Behind Door #1, you need to flick the switch at the end without jumping or flying. To do this, transform into the snake, climb up and down the walls and use your abilities to kill the crabs.</p>

<p>Coming out the other side on the bottom, go <em>boing </em>again (try not to hit the crab<em>) </em>then make your way over. With the spikes you want to go when the first spikes drop, then when the second drops, then the third, but then go back to the second because the third spikes will come back up. Now third, then run to the other side. Once you <em>boing </em>up, transform into the pig and sniff out the invisible platform.</p>

<p>… and then transform into the frog here. Now this you may get stuck on, but it’s all about using the frog’s tongue at the right time. Jump up on the right side of the moving platform so the flower will spit a fireball at you. On the way back down, you’ll want to lick the rotator just before the fireball is about to hit the brick. That’ll hit the switch, and we’re done with the second door.</p>

<p>Now for door #3! This one is all about moving and not stopping. You’ll want to be the lion for most of this one. If you get to the end of frame, run left again and then back to the right.</p>
<p>Dash and ground-pound your way through the blocks.</p>

<p>When you’re at this section, make sure to leave when the screen is situated about here so that you give yourself some space and so you don’t find yourself needing to run back and forth (then again, you could always just jump on the spot).</p>

<p>When you get to the end, you’ll have to fight some monsters without stopping. Transform into the dragon and kill some baddies. However the last one is a skeleton and they’ll stun you if they ground-pound near you and your feet are on the ground. So make sure that you jump before they do.</p>

<p>But after that, flick the switch, walk out and grab the Stone Axe.</p>
<h2>Relic #3</h2>
<p>The third and final relic is the Ocarina and it’s hidden at the end of the The Misty Woods. Head all the way through and be one frame right of where the boss battle was…</p>
