The thought of some criminals abusing your vehicle, chopping it up in to pieces and selling it off to other criminals is enough to drive you nuts. That’s why we love seeing stories like this one out of Georgia where these lovely individuals get busted in the act."

It also wasn’t a dramatic police chase after they swiped a Hellcat. Instead, it was the sheriff’s office investigating a string of thefts from construction sites in the area."

A deputy tracked the van down, which was parked at a house not too far from the other one. Poking around, investigators found more construction equipment which was reported stolen. Of course, the thieves had removed VINs from whatever they could, like that wouldn’t be suspicious."
