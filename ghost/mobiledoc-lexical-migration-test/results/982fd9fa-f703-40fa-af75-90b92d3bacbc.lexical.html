<hr>
<p>Perusing eBay like we do all the time, you can run into some interesting listings like this 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS. With a current bid of $17,300 at the time this article was written, you might think it could be a good deal. After all, this thing has a 396 paired up with a Muncie M22 4-speed and a 12-bolt rear. But not everyone is going to agree if this is something you should snatch up or if you should keep fishing.</p>

<p>For some, the dream of owning a ’69 Chevelle is enough to get them excited. After all, this is one of the most iconic muscle cars ever made. And this one looks pretty clean with at least decent blue paint and white stripes, shiny chrome, and some nice mags.</p>

<p>As for the mechanical condition of this Chevelle, that’s a bit of a mystery. It hasn’t been started and the listing says there will be no attempt to start it. You can draw your own conclusions about why that might be. The seller claims this ride has been sitting in a shop in south Texas for the last 10 years, so that’s a bonus if you’re worried about corrosion.</p>

<p>Some underbody photos are included in the listing and there don’t seem to be any troubling signs of corrosion. However, the rear diff does have some fluid collecting on it, so that might be bad.</p>

<p>The interior is questionable. Nothing looks bad in the photos, but all the seats have fresh covers on them, so what’s underneath might not be pretty at all. What’s more, the steering wheel, pedals, stereo, and a few other things are aftermarket. There are some additional gauges installed, including a nice big tach with shift light.</p>
