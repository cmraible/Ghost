<p>“Kamala was progressive in the Senate. Old friends from California remember some of the things that you describe in this article. Harris has had opportunities to speak out about minimum wage, and now this killing of Asian-American women in GA. These opportunities are being laid at her feet. This is a teachable moment, we need to hear Kamala's voice, the one we heard when she served in the Senate.”</p>
