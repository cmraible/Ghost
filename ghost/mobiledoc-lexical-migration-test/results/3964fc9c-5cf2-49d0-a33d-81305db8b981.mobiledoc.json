Instead of just ponying up the cash, he resorts to all kinds of ridiculous and amusing antics in the pursuit of ducking the parking fee. Just as ridiculous but far more scary because it wasn’t scripted is this woman’s attempt to back her Mercedes from a parking spot, only for the whole thing to go sideways in the most absurd way possible."

It’s like no matter what, they will tug on the steering wheel toward that object they’re afraid of and do damage to the car. Well, this lady does that as she tries back out around a wall and a washing machine, getting the passenger side of the Mercedes hung up on it."

Once she moves the only thing keeping it from running away, the luxury car does just that. And like in so many of these situations, she tries stopping the vehicle by tugging on the door as if she’s Superman and by sheer strength can halt the Mercedes."
