In the last few decades, the brand has built trucks that were faster than supercars of their day. These things utilized a high revving V6 engine which put out nearly 300 horsepower for cars that weighed far below the 4,000lb range. As a result, trucks like the Syclone and Typhoon were particularly good at laying down low quarter-mile times at extremely high speeds. Unfortunately, the outstanding performance also comes with hype, making finding these cars pretty tricky. However, this SUV poses an opportunity to get your hands on one of GMC's rarest vehicles with the click of a button.",
