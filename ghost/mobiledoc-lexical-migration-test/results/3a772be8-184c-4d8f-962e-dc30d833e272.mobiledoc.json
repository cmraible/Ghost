We’re talking about the modern muscle car not having a snowball’s chance in hell of winning the race at any point, even before it starts. That’s what we bring to you today, a video of classic American muscle cars racing modern muscle cars, the youngins sent packing with their tail between their legs."

          "Too often, people who don’t know much think the classic muscle cars were fast for their time but are nothing compared to what we have today. In some cases that’s true, but keep in mind the guys driving these cars have fine tuned their skills, plus they have other tricks up their sleeves, making them tough to beat. This is a lesson in respecting your elders. There’s something to be learned from those things and people which have withstood the test of time."

Just as interesting is seeing a C8 Corvette race a Fourth-Gen Camaro. That might not sound like a fair fight, but the badging on the Camaro says it’s packing an LSX and the plumbing hints at a serious forced induction setup."

If you have the resources to build your motor, add forced induction, fine-tune the chassis, etc. why wouldn’t you? Keeping a car stock really isn’t all that fun, but we know not everyone agrees with that because they whine so loudly about modifications."

Although, it’s worth pointing out the classic models in those races don’t really look all that built. This just proves that excellent drag racers are built not bought."
