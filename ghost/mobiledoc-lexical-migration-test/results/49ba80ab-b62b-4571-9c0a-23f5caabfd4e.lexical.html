<p>Good things are happening! After our reporting on his fossil fuel connections, California’s Insurance Commissioner disclosed giving back money to a natural gas company that had just given him a sizable donation. As we have noted in our reporting, insurance regulators can have a major role in the fight against climate change. As if that weren’t enough, another fossil fuel project in the Pacific Northwest has bitten the dust.</p>
<p>There is also a ray of hope on the horizon for parents: Two progressives in Congress have proposed legislation that would establish a universal child allowance and tax credits to help families. In labor news, the floodgates have opened for Starbucks unionization. And New York City’s new mayor bowed to activist pressure over a controversial pick to head the city’s mental health agency.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s week’s edition of You Love To See It, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->
<h3 id="california-insurance-commissioner-has-second-thoughts-on-fossil-fuel-money">California Insurance Commissioner Has Second Thoughts On Fossil Fuel Money</h3>
<p>Ricardo Lara, the top California insurance regulator whose inaction on climate has been a focus of recent <em>Daily Poster</em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/why-is-california-backtracking-on-climate-related-insurance-reform/">reporting</a>, recently disclosed returning an $8,100 contribution from Sempra Energy, an $11 billion California-based natural gas company.</p>
<p>Returning fossil fuel money is a change for Lara, who's had no qualms about accepting Sempra donations in the past. During his campaign for insurance commissioner in 2017 and 2018, Lara accepted <a href="https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1011327&view=contributions&session=2017">$10,500 in contributions</a> from Sempra — not to mention a pair of <a href="https://www.consumerwatchdog.org/insurance/california-insurance-commisioner-ricardo-lara-receives-d-average-report-card">field-level Beyoncé tickets</a>. That cash was never returned.</p>
<p>Could the new refund to Sempra suggest a greater concern with regulators taking cash from fossil fuel companies, or at least the optics of it? Lara's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The good climate news does not end there.</p>
<p>The Wind Chaser project, a natural gas energy project in Oregon from Perennial Power Holdings, is dead, the company has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wind-chaser-project-terminating-site-certificate-301473915.html">announced</a>. Even better, the company’s vice president of operations and development signaled that the move could be the beginning of the end for similar projects.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed that the current environment for such new projects makes it difficult for us to continue investing in these plans,” J.J. Jamieson said in a statement.</p>
<p>For years, natural gas has been promoted as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels despite the fact that its extraction is extremely environmentally destructive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has opened the door for antitrust action against Arizona’s Salt River Project, a public utility that jacked up electrical rates on customers who had solar panels installed on their rooftops. The court held that even if the rooftop solar market continued to thrive despite the rate hikes, SRP’s behavior was improper. The decision could have <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/appeals-court-decision-opens-door-to-sue-public-power-utilities-for-rooftop/618147/">important implications</a> for other suits involving rooftop solar, experts say.</p>
<h3 id="new-potential-family-relief">New Potential Family Relief</h3>
<p>Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) have introduced a new child allowance bill to help parents. The legislation would create a universal child allowance and provide new tax credits for adult dependents and single and married tax filers. The People’s Policy Project’s Matt Breunig <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/02/03/members-tlaib-and-jones-introduce-the-end-child-poverty-act/">says</a> the new bill is “by far the best child allowance proposal introduced in Congress and should serve as a blueprint for future Democratic efforts in this area of policy.” These new programs would replace the current complex and inefficient child benefit system, which doesn’t even reach those who most need relief.</p>
<p>Breunig estimates that the new policy, if enacted, would cut child poverty by two-thirds relative to the current baseline. He notes that with the legislation, no family would ever end up in poverty simply because of having a child.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/02/03/fernando-cabrera-may-be-adams-pick-to-run-rebranded-thrivenyc/">news swirled</a> that New York City Mayor Eric Adams was considering New York City Councilman Fernando Cabrera to head the mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health, formerly known as ThriveNYC. Cabrera was uniquely unqualified for the position, given his backward views.</p>
<p>In 2014, the councilman — also a church pastor — took a trip to Uganda, which had passed a harsh anti-gay law. Cabrera <a href="https://gaycitynews.com/lgbtq-clubs-slam-shaun-donovan-for-fernando-cabrera-endorsement/">heaped praise on the country</a>, lauding the fact, as he put it, that it had resisted pressure from the U.S. over its treatment of LGBTQIA individuals.</p>
<p>“Godly people are in government,” Cabrera said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=16&v=MSs8UQQgOVc&feature=emb_logo">a video</a>.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/donate#/donate" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>Cabrera also came under fire in 2017 after a <a href="https://twitter.com/WalkerBragman/status/885357305268711424?s=20&t=HLVsgid9I1zfavLDue1A5A">video was uncovered</a> (by Walker Bragman) of the councilman preacher promoting the idea that wealthy people are harder working and therefore more capable than the poor.</p>
<p>But now, following pushback from LGBTQIA activists, Adams has signaled that Cabrera is <a href="https://gaycitynews.com/after-outrage-mayor-adams-says-wont-hire-fernando-cabrera/">off the table</a>! Praise be.</p>
<h3 id="union-fever">Union Fever</h3>
<p>Starbucks workers are continuing to unionize in droves. The wave has been building since December, when Buffalo, N.Y., Starbucks workers formed the first union at a corporate store. On Monday, Starbucks Workers United, the union leading the push, <a href="https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1488179911286312963">announced</a> that 15 new stores had filed for union elections. Workers at <a href="http://npr.org/2022/01/31/1076978207/starbucks-union-push-spreads-to-54-stores-in-19-states">54 Starbucks stores</a> are now looking to unionize.</p>
<p>Solidarity!</p>
<p>More good news: Union elections have <a href="https://twitter.com/UnionElections/status/1488554251752194049">doubled</a> in the past year — from 80 last January to 162 this January — according to Daily Union Elections, a Twitter account that tracks union elections.</p>
