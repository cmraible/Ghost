It is, among other things, a climate allegory, a commentary on society's treatment of science, a critique of media, and a lament about governmental corruption. Different people are going to interact with different parts of that story in all sorts of ways. I also think the movie gives voice to universal truths that we all know are real, but that we often don’t talk about or even put into words — and I’m guessing even folks in some of the industries that are being satirized are able to accept the truisms, or at least aren’t offended by them. For instance, many people working in media know that so much media these days reverts to frivolity and distraction. It’s undeniable.
