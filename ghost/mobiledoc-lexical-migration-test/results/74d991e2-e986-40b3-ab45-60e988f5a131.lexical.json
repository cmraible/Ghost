A customer can buy a muscle car  from the Nickey dealership, and Nickey would modify it to their liking.  The Nickey dealership was sold in 1973 and renamed Keystone Chevrolet,  but those who built the performance cars started their own location that  was named \"Nickey Chicago\", but they closed their doors in 1977. Fast  forward to 2002, and the legal rights and trademarks to the Nickey name  were bought by Stefano Bimbi, a muscle car collector. That is when  Nickey Performance was born, and the company still operates today.",
