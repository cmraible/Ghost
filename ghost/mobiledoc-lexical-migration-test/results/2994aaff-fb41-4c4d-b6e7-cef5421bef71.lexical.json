In fact, many of us car people with a love for racing are that person as our love for going fast drastically overestimates our wallet’s ability to provide for our hobby. This is how legends are made, start at the bottom with whatever you have and build it into the perfect weapon for your needs. At least that's what this driver must have been thinking when he absolutely embarrassed an electric car on the track.",

It's hard to really give details about either vehicle as the description leaves a lot to the imagination. Either way, the opponent to this truck-wielding hero was a Tesla model 3 which is considered to be one of Tesla's more rounded out models. For years we have been hearing nothing about how fast and exciting these vehicles are and honestly it all just sounds like talk. Because of this, many enthusiasts really don't like Teslas with many of us swearing off the brand for good.",

This particular race is a perfect example of why the good ole’ American V8 will never be beaten at its own game of being loud, fast, and fun.",
