However, cases like this high-profile theft of a Bentley in Miami help to highlight a problem that’s all too common. It helps that the owner of the pricey British luxury car is a famous sports agent, ensuring the local news covered the theft. But the sad thing is this could happen to anyone, even the single mother who only owns a Hyundai Elantra."

The fact is it’s explosively out of control and seems to only be getting worse. Chances are you or someone you know could fall victim in the near future."

Chalk it up to a lack of police, few consequences for stealing cars, and plenty of financial gain available for those participating in the crime. What it all comes down to is people are losing their rides, having to jump through a million hoops with their insurance, and in some cases it’s costing them dearly."
