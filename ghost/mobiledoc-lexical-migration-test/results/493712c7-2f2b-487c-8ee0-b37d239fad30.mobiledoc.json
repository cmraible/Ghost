The wailing guitars backed by the organs and the psychedelic synth perfectly encapsulates the feeling of losing yourself in the soundscapes of a space opera. At any point in the game, you can have Francis wail like crazy on his guitar and it feels like the developers recorded hours of unique guitar solos to match every moment possible within the game."

Essentially, the game is a walking simulator where throughout 95% of it, you’ll be tilting the joystick rightward hoping for something to happen, only to then stumble across a cosmic being and show it your legendary guitar prowess by playing a basic game of Simon Says. It all results in lacklustre gameplay which fails to compliment its stunning presentation."
