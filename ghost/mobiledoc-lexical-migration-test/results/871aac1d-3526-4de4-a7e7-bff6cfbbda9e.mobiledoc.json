Autech were responsible for the motorsport upgrades that result in a 227-horsepower, all-wheel drive, mega hatch. Not many Pulsars received the full performance treatment, with this car stripped of luxuries to weigh 30kg less than its counterparts, and sharing gear ratios with the racer. Autech also fitted front and rear skid plates."

Large grilles and intakes serve to cool the pumped-up engine, while integrated spotlights give it a real rally car look. The white body and gold alloy wheels are a great anti-social combination that serve to compliment the substantial boot spoiler."

A three-spoke Nismo steering wheel is presented to the driver, along with immaculate switchgear that has been well preserved for the past 26 years. However, one of this car’s greatest assets is that it retains all of the practicality of a regular Pulsar. That might not sound that exciting, but it means that you can take your miniature rally car on even the most mundane of errands."
