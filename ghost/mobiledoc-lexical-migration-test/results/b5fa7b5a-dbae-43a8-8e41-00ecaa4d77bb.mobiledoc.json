Meticulously preserved and uniquely personalized by its first owner Teddy Beck, this Aston Martin DB4 is \"widely regarded\" as one of the best and most original examples. Beck from Cheshire, England, nabbed the car in the early '60s, and he kept it for over 20 years where it was driven just over 15,000 miles. Now with four owners under its belt including the director of Aston Martin Victor Gauntlett and known car collector Paul Vestey, this fantastic DB4 GT is now looking for a fifth."

Featuring a lightweight alloy body from Ercole Spada, this is the only Zagato in existence to wear the Peony Red hue. Under the hood sits an aluminum 3.7-liter inline-six engine topped with three Weber 45 DCOE carburetors and backed by a 4-speed manual transmission. With an output of 314-horsepower, this gem can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds. Stopping power comes from 4-wheel Girling Hydraulic disc brakes. Handling duties are provided by a front independent suspension with coil springs and an anti-roll bar with a live axle with watts linkage and coil springs out back."
