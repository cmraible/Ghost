          "If you aren’t familiar with the automotive culture of Japan, you might be surprised to see a Porsche 911 roaming the busy streets of Tokyo. Even more shocking is the level of customization oftentimes poured into such cars. Even among Japanese automotive masterpieces, this slant nose, widebody Porsche 997 is really something else."

The guy is involved in quite a few different car projects, including Tofugarage, a private members club in Germany with ties to Rocket Bunny."

Not only does it make the nose drop down suddenly like the slant nose 911s of old, the headlights are located low in the front fascia, completely transforming the look of the car."

          "The widebody treatment is a fairly common route to go with Porsche 911s in Japan and it’s easy to see why. That, combined with the fact it’s slammed within a hair’s breath of the ground, makes this Porsche look sleek and mean. Just don’t try to drive up or down any steep driveway skirts. Of course, this ride is bagged, so you can raise the different corners as needed."
