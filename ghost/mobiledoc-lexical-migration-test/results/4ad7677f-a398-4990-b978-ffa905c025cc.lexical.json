The now-supercharged Mustang GT had just 266 miles on the odometer when the unauthorized joyride resulted in the car being totaled. The pictures of the crashed Mustang GT showed that it took a hard impact directly in the middle of the car possibly as the result from hitting a tree or utility pole.",
