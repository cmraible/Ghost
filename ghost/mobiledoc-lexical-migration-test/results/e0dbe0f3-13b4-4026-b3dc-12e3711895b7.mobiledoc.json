This is the last year for a Factory Fuel Injected square-body K5 Blazer with a removable top. Just try and find one cleaner. The interior is also in exceptional condition. Just take a look at those underside photos. This Blazer is the definition of no rust. Super clean and just what the Dr. ordered. "

It is getting very hard to find these in this kind of condition for a fair price.  The body on this Jeep is super clean and straight.  There are no rust issues with this truck and we found no rust repair.  It is just a nice solid and original body. It was recently professionally repainted it in its original color of Grenadine Metallic and the paint looks fantastic!"

A rare medium wheelbase Land Cruiser that presents a better-than-factory appearance, the truck benefitted from a detailed, body-off restoration. During that reboot, solid metal was stripped bare, promptly re-sprayed in quaint Dune Beige pigment and shrouded in a fresh canvas roof. And presently, that Rhino-inspired shell creates a classy, wet-look profile that mixes searing glares with smooth reflections."
