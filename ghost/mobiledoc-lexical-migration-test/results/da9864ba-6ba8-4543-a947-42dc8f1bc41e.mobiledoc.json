Sure, Mopar and Mustang fans are going to try to talk trash because that’s just what they do and it’s all in good fun, but we have a feeling this Chevy could hold its own at the track in the right hands. However, it’s a little too beautiful to abuse that much. Thankfully, it doesn’t sound like a whimpering chihuahua but instead makes the right noise at WOT, indicating this muscle car has some real bite. But the performance isn’t insane."
