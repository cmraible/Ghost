<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/six-classic-cars-found-sunk-in-a-river/">Cars and water</a>: they don’t mix well, especially when there’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pontiac-fiero-collection/">high quantity of H2O</a>. Perhaps that’s why so many people, including us, find it fascinating when an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-silverado-pulled-from-oregon-river/">old car is found submerged</a> in a body of water. There’s an inherent <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jeep-recovered-from-california-river/">mystery around how the vehicle ended up there</a> and why. That’s certainly the case with two cars accidentally discovered by a fisherman in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p>The unnamed fisherman was in his boat on Lake Wheeler on a Sunday, likely enjoying the nice weather and hoping to catch something worthy of telling a tale or two about. Using his fishfinder sonar, he spotted something completely unexpected: a car. That’s when he dialed 911 to alert authorities.</p>

<p>Divers were able to reach the submerged car, which was near the Lake Wheeler dam and found it wasn’t alone. A second car was nearby. Authorities say it looks like both have been in the water for quite some time. The divers <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mazda-6-with-a-body/">searched for occupants in both cars</a> and came up empty. They were also unsuccessful in locating any tags for a quick identification of the vehicles.</p>
<p>As we’ve shown you in multiple videos, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/six-classic-cars-found-sunk-in-a-river/">it’s not an easy operation</a> extracting a car from a lake or river. It requires specialized equipment, specialized knowledge, and a lot of effort. One crew we follow on YouTube, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1973-ford-mustang-pulled-from-water/">Adventures With Purpose</a>, is set up for these kinds of operations, but they’re on the west coast.</p>
<p>A lot of people are guessing about what kind of car showed up on the fishfinder screen. It’s not a clear image at all, but some see a muscle car, Corvette, even a Cadillac with big tailfins. That, along with questions of whether this is a case of insurance fraud, murder, or ditching evidence from something like a bank robbery has everyone guessing. It looks like the cars will stay underwater for now because authorities say they’re not sure when they’ll remove them, even though a tow truck was on the scene when divers made their discovery.</p>
