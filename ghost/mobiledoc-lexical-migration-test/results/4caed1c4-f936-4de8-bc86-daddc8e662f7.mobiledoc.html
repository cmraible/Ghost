<p>he final variant would be dubbed GNX, for "Grand National Experimental." Buick built just 547 GNXs, all of which were built and then shipped to ASC McLaren for final assembly of the GNX package.</p>
<p>The GNX was powered by a worked-over version of the existing 3.8 liter turbo. Horsepower was stated at 280, with 360 lb/ft of torque on tap. In truth, the GNX was underrated. It actually produced 300 horsepower and over 400 lb/ft of torque.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, popularity of the third generation run of the F-Body has seen a surprising spike, but more times than not, it’s the third-gen <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/camaro-vs-firebird/">Camaro</a> that’s getting the spotlight, not the humble Pontiac variant. However, if you look the market on a shorter timeline, you’ll see strong interest in the same year run Pontiac Firebirds, Formulas, and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/best-trans-ams/">Trans Ams,</a> and for good reason. This 1986 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/pontiacs-trans-am-y82/">Pontiac Trans Am</a> is a beautiful example of the generation, as well as the modern classic American market that’s largely underestimated.</p>
