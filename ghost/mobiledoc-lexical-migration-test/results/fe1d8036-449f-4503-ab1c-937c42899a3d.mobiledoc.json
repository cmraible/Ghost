The modified Apocalypse Hellfire 6x6 Jeep, which was parked at SoFlo Jeeps’s owner’s house in Fort Lauderdale, was stolen by a couple of guys at 3 am on December 16. They showed up prepared with a laptop to reprogram the ignition."

A person in the area saw a local news report about the theft and called Ghattas, telling him he knew where the vehicle was located. The thieves had dumped it in an alley behind a high school’s field. Even better, Ghattas says it was in pristine condition, which is truly shocking. Sometimes, thieves will take a car and then park it elsewhere for a few days to see if there’s a tracker and someone shows up to get it back. This method helps them to avoid having the cops locate a chop shop or area where even more stolen cars are being stored."
