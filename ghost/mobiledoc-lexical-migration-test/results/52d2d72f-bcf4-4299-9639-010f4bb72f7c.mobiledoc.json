While we only get to see a single shot of the outside, it's clear how impressive the build quality is with smooth black pain, clean body gaps bright chrome and wire wheels wrapped in white-wall tires. From this view, you'd think this 1948 Buick Roadmaster was restored back to factory specs, but the description tells another story."

That should provide more than enough power for this big car, while giving it a satisfying rumble. Adding to the restomod upgrades, this Buick is ready to master the road with an automatic transmission, power disc brakes and power steering."
