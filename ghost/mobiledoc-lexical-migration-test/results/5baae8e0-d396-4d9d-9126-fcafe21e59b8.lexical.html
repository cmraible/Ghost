<hr>
<p>Since the 1960s, Festival Event Cars are driven around Central Indiana to help get everyone in the mood for the upcoming <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-indy-500-pace/">Indianapolis 500</a>. For this year organizers revealed a fleet of 50 identical 2023 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-driver-shows-off/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> SS convertibles as the Festival Event Cars. Considering the Camaro is dead man walking, the move takes on even more meaning.</p>

<p>The reveal of this unique fleet was done on April 3 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on the main straightaway. When May starts, the Camaros will be deployed to start sending the signal to everyone that celebration of the 500 is in full swing.</p>
<p>According to GM, these Festival Event Cars are actually a unique option code for the 2023 Chevy Camaro SS convertible. However, you can’t go to a dealership and order them, although these cars undoubtedly will be sought after by collectors both after the Indianapolis 500 and for years to come.</p>

<p>That paint you see is Sharkskin Metallic, which compliments the graphics done by Chevrolet’s Performance Design Studio. You’ll also note the 20-inch aluminum wheels and Brembo brakes peeking out at all four corners. Ash Gray leather sets the right tone for the interior.</p>
<p>“These Camaro convertibles are a symbol of the shared passion Chevrolet, INDYCAR and the 500 Festival board have for the Indianapolis 500,” said Mike Quinn, Chevrolet Indianapolis district sales manager. “Living and working in Central Indiana, seeing these Camaros on the road always reminds me we’re one step closer to May.”</p>
<p>If you didn’t catch the news before, GM confirmed 2024 will be the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dead-chevy-camaro/">final year</a> the Chevy Camaro will be offered to the public. In other words, this might be the last Camaro used for the Festival Event Cars. If that’s the case, each one will be worth even more.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis 500 is celebrating its 107th anniversary. The race will be held on Sunday, May 28, 2023.</p>
