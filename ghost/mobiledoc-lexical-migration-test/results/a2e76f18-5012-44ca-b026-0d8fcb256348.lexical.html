<hr>
<p>It shouldn’t be a secret that we love a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sleeper-chevy-c10/">good sleeper</a>. We’re not talking about some guy who has an old Chevy Cavalier with a muffler and cold air intake. No, we want cars that don’t look all that fast but are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-hellcat-races-grand-national/">laying down 500-horsepower or more</a>. After all, you can’t really have fun unless you’re <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/liberty-walk-twin-turbo-lamborghini-huracan-breathes-fire/">shredding so much rubber</a> your tire guy sends you a Christmas card each year. Surely that’s the case for the owner of this modified Buick Regal Turbo T Limited.</p>
<p>By now, a growing number of non-car people realize the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/motorious-grand-national/">Buick Grand National</a> and GNX are serious threats. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-modern-muscle-sedan-would-you-buy/">sinister blacked-out look</a> has become a calling card, alerting others than a wolf in black sheep’s clothing is near. And while this car shares the body shape, the fact it’s adorned with some shiny stuff might be enough to put people at ease.</p>
<p>When you watch the video, you get to see this Buick in action immediately. It lays down a serious burnout, the kind which would horrify your mother and make your friends proud. While a stock Regal Turbo T is a blast, this one has been tuned to push a monstrous 770-hp, which is incredible for a V6.</p>
<p>We not only have a weakness for sleepers but also the sounds a big turbo with a wastegate makes. Yes, we also love the Roots supercharger whine, but there’s something magical about super snail noises coming from an American muscle car. That’s doubly true when the front seats look more like something you’d find in your grandma’s living room.</p>
<p>The owner bought this car with a partial roll cage, so it’s seen some action. He used to race it on the drag strip when he first got it, but unfortunately he hasn’t done any runs since adding all the current modifications. We’d love to know what it would do the quarter in, because the only doubt we have is how well it would hook up, not if it can accelerate like a bat out of hell.</p>
