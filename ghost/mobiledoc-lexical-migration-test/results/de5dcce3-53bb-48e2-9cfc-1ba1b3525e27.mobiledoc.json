The big one has to do with the transmission, which makes a foreboding sound every time it shifts into first. When they drain the transmission, they find pieces of the teeth for first gear, which would have most people balled up on the ground panicking over how much that will cost to repair. Speaking of cost, the transmission rebuild alone could set him back $30,000. The other problems total up to about $18,000. It’s enough to make you think twice about snatching any "

If the car is suspiciously cheap, there’s probably a good reason, and it might not be that great sob story the owner is telling. No doubt Hoover knew this when he bought the Lambo and did it just for some great entertainment factor on his YouTube channel, so at least he’s monetizing a bad financial decision."

He can catch all kinds of problems before you pull the trigger, so at least you know what you’re getting into if you decide to go ahead and plunk down your hard-earned cash. A mechanic’s inspection might not always be an option, but when it is you’re wise to exercise it."
