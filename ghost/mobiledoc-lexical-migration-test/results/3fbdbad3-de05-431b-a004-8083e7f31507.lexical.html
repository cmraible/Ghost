    <p>I’ll start with the hard part: As of today, we are reducing our team by about one third — eliminating 50 jobs, mostly in sales, support, and other business functions. We are also changing our business model to more directly drive the mission we set out on originally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a big, big cull. Medium’s whole approach to becoming a business is clearly shifting.</p>
<p>The problem?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Upon further reflection, it’s clear that the broken system is ad-driven media on the internet. It simply doesn’t serve people. In fact, it’s not designed to. The vast majority of articles, videos, and other “content” we all consume on a daily basis is paid for — directly or indirectly — by corporations who are funding it in order to advance their goals. And it is measured, amplified, and rewarded based on its ability to do that. Period. As a result, we get…well, what we get. And it’s getting worse.</p>

<p>Does he have a solution? No. But he clearly doesn’t want Medium to be part of that problem, so he’s chopped sales staff to reduce burn rate while the site seeks a new business model:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>So, we are shifting our resources and attention to defining a new model for writers and creators to be rewarded, based on the value they’re creating for people. And toward building a transformational product for curious humans who want to get smarter about the world every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The buried implication here <em>seems</em> to be some form of method for committed readers rewarding inspiring creators – but that’s an assumption. All we can say for sure is that Medium is changing direction, seeks a new way of monetising publishing – and will be doing it with one third fewer staff – and an existing workforce who’ve just lost a bunch of colleagues, and who are keenly aware that their (admittedly well-funded) employer doesn’t have a workable business model yet.</p>
<p>Interesting times at Medium.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
