<hr>
<p>When it came to reviving the legendary racing icon known as the Shelby GT350, Ford nailed the design. Built on the Mustang's current S550 platform, the finished product was a car chomping at the bit to carve corners and dive into apexes with the best of them. Ford also developed the rarer <a href="https://palmspringscruisinassociation.tapkat.org/winallengrantsshelbyGT350?promo=SDIG25">2017 Shelby GT350R</a>, a dedicated track version. This particular example is incredibly special considering it is the <em>only</em> yellow car built, and it belongs to Shelby American World Championship driver Allen Grant. The Palm Springs Cruisin' Association is looking to give this rare example to a new home. All you have to do is <a href="https://palmspringscruisinassociation.tapkat.org/winallengrantsshelbyGT350?promo=SDIG25">click here</a> and make a small donation to Desert Cancer Foundation to be entered in to win. The Desert Cancer Foundation helps the treatment of cancer patients who lack health insurance or have insufficient funds to pay for medical treatment. Even more, the winner takes home rare memorabilia from Grant's personal collection and will join him for a one-on-one lesson on how to drive the car on track. </p>

<p>Finished in a brilliant, bold Triple Yellow with a contrasting black-painted roof, this Shelby GT350R was is in fantastic condition considering only 11,000 miles grace the odometer. This track-ready Mustang was painted to match Grant's championship Conventry Motors yellow 1963 Cobra roadster by George Lucas. A set of 19-inch carbon fiber wheels are shod with a set of Michelin Sport Cup 2 tires, and another set of racing wheels come with it. Keeping the paint protected is a full Shelby cover. Inside of the GT350R are Recaro Cloth/Miko suede manual sport seats, and an R-Electronics package featuring voice-activated navigation system on a touchscreen. </p>

<p>Under the hood is a 5.2-liter Ti-VCT Flat Plane Crank V8 engine capable of 526-horsepower and 429 lb/ft of torque. Stopping comes from big Brembo brakes, the most powerful brakes installed on a production Mustang. Planting the car to the ground and providing utmost handling is the advanced suspension which involves a MagneRide damping system.</p>
