<p>“The globally successful Mazda MX-5 has become the roadster of choice for millions since its 1989 launch. The iconic Nissan GT-R traces its history back even further to 1969, when it was unveiled as the ultimate performance version of the six-cylinder Nissan Skyline,” event coordinators offered. “Owners of both of these legendary models, from the earliest examples right up to the latest showroom versions, will be taking their places in the busy showground.”</p>
