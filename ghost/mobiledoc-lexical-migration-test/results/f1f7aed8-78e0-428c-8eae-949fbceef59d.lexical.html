<p>Once again GM is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/dead-chevy-camaro/">retiring the Chevy Camaro nameplate</a>, something it did not too long ago for a minute. To help commemorate the end, the automaker has announced the ZL1 Garage 56 Edition. It also commemorates the muscle car competing at the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/remembering-the-the-1955-le-mans-tragedy/">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> and silly automotive sites trying to mock that.</p>

<p>Just like the name, Chevy is limiting production to just 56 units, so we expect many will sit in preservation bubbles and whatnot until 20 to 30 years from now when they cross the auction block for a few million. They won’t be available for consumers until sometime later in 2023.</p>
<p>The Chevy Camaro ZL1 that raced at Le Mans was a NASCAR Cup car, so NASCAR, Hendrick Motorsports, Goodyear, IMSA, and Chevy are all collaborating for this special edition model. The vehicle was entered through Garage 56, a single-entry class for unique vehicles to participate in the legendary endurance race, something many an automotive journalist didn’t seem to grasp.</p>
<p>Each Garage 56 Camaro ZL1 will wear Riptide Blue with a graphics package inspired by the race car. There will also be a NASCAR 75th Anniversary logo on the hood, but no you won’t get any sponsorship money for running that. There’s also a special badge on the front fenders, with satin mirrors, a black fuel door, and carbon-fiber inserts for the exterior.</p>
<p>The interior gains Garage 56 emblems and a special steering wheel badge.</p>
<p>Behind the wheel of the Garage 56 Camaro ZL1 that competed at Le Mans was Jimmie Johnson, a seven-time NASCAR Cup Series Champion; Jenson Button, 2009 Formula One World Champion; and multi-time Le Mans winner Mike Rockenfeller, adding to the compelling story of this limited edition car.</p>
