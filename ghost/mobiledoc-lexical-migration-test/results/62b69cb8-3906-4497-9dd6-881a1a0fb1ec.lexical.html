<p>With many people staying home and not only spring break but now summer vacation plans canceled, you’re probably feeling more than a little stir crazy. One way to combat that is to check out some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/tour-some-virtual-auto-museums/">amazing car sites remotely through the power of modern technology</a>. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tour-petersen-automotive-museums-hot-rods-in-the-vault/">Petersen Automotive Museum</a> recently posted a video tour of the Galpin Collection lead by <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/driven-restores-carroll-shelbys-detomaso-pantera/">Galpin COO and President Beau Boeckmann</a> of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dan-kahn-driven/"><em>Car Kings</em></a><em></em>fame for your entertainment.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/05/Motorious--11.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="See The Galpin Collection Of Cars From Home " loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>As you’ve probably come to expect from Boeckmann, the cars in the Galpin Collection are eclectic and unique. Anyone who’s been watching <em>Car Kings</em> has seen not only the excellent skill displayed by the shop, but also the fact it goes for some of the strangest, downright bizarre vehicles like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-kings-restore-fabled-bathtub-hot-rod/">Bathtub Hot Rod</a>.</p>
<p>The tour starts out with the very old and very rare 1897 Leon Bollee, a tricar powered by an 882cc horizontal single-cylinder engine. Boeckmann says he believes it to be the first true sports car, but you’ll have to watch the video to see why.</p>
<p>Among some of the interesting rides Boeckmann shows off is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/see-historic-trans-am-racers-get-flogged-at-sonoma/">Trans Am</a> Pinto, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-kings-restores-lil-red-wrecker/">Lil Red Wrecker</a>, a Maverick Funny Car, and Mach 4, a four-engine Mustang. There’s also a Mystery Machine tribute, several micro cars, Lagondas, a flying car, and so many more. You’ll be hitting pause on this video a lot since Boeckmann just walks past amazing cars left and right, highlighting only a few.</p>

<p>There are many other amazing cars in the collection, like the 2019 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/alleged-ford-gt-flip-scheme-ends-in-lawsuit/">Ford GT</a> Heritage Edition used to kick off the first episode of <em>Car Kings</em>. That’s the fastest vehicle Galpin has on the showroom. Galpin has more classics than modern cars, like the 1965 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ken-miles/">Shelby GT350</a> in original condition.</p>
<p>If you could have just one vehicle out of the Galpin Collection, which would it be? Leave a comment below and let us know.</p>
