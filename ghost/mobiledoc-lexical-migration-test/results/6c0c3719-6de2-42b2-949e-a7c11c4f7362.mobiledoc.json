Then, he received a phone call from police that his beloved truck had been found. However, the good news was cut short when the storage lot informed him his pickup had been sitting for four months, racking up almost $12,000 in storage fees."

For the owner it’s his way of getting around and probably has plenty of sentimental value. If you own one of these, beware what you have is a rapidly appreciating asset others would love to separate from you."

Instead, the man who struggled to get to physical therapy appointments after suffering an accident made do without his primary mode of transportation for months."

Considering the industry is highly regulated by local governments, we have felt for a long time serious reform is necessary. These types of problems happen all over, not just in Michigan, and it’s time things change."

The tow company then said he could get the pickup back for $3,000 since they had spent $2,000 on unauthorized work."

The tow company claims it faxed the truck’s information to the local police department as required by state law when they picked it up. The police department says it has no record of that fax and only learned the tow company had the truck when tow company employee asked for another copy of the abandoned vehicle report months later. That’s when police ran the registration number, getting a hit on a stolen vehicle report."

The tow company claims they found the vehicle without wheels. However, the local news station spoke to people in the neighborhood where the truck was left and those residents claim the Chevy was parked with the wheels still attached. Now, the owner of the truck who’s strapped for cash has to save up to buy new wheels and tires."

Trying to fight them is absolutely maddening since they play dirty and behave like the law doesn’t apply to them. Yes, there are tow companies that do everything above board and we applaud them, but cases like this really makes our blood boil."
