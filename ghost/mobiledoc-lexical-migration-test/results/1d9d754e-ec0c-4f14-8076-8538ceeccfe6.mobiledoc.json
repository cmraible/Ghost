Sitting inside you’ll find a fully customized Fast And Furious five Katzkin leather interior that’ll have you feeling like a movie star. On top of that, it’s got a fully blacked out exterior to strike a sense of intimidation into the hearts of anyone who looks at it. Such an aggressive car deserves an equally overpowering drive train, so that’s exactly what I got."

          "Under the hood is a 5.7-liter hemi V8 engine, one that Mopar enthusiasts everywhere should know pretty well by this point. It might not seem like much compared to Scat Packs, SRT models, or Hellcats of today, but back in 2011 this was a pretty substantial power source. On top of that, it’s got an automatic transmission which proves themselves more than capable of handling rough conditions with its inclusion in police models of the time. All of that power goes straight to the muscle car as wheels featuring a diameter of 20 inches and low weight due to their aluminum construction. Without a doubt, it’s a great muscle car for anyone looking to remember the Fast And Furious franchise and it’s made even better by the fact it’s one of only seven made."
