<hr>
<p>We’ve all heard some crazy stories from the Bonneville salt flats of high-octane racers traveling at ridiculous speeds. While over teams aim for acceleration at a drag strip, these drivers and builds require top speed. Even the current world land speed record of over 763 miles per hour was set in a desert, which is a good case for many enthusiasts to get into the sport. Unlike most motorsports, these racers compete against their own records, which is why they have a reputation for making history in the automotive field. This particular car was built for the incredibly high speed of 200 mph but fell short of its mark before being hidden away for decades from the public.</p>

<p>Initially, this 1968 Dodge Charger was built for a film series or something approximating that by the current owner. Having big plans for the vehicle, he and his crew had set a goal of reaching 200 mph via extensive modification. This led to the excitement surrounding the car, which eventually boiled over upon spotting a seemingly abandoned dry lake bed in Las Vegas. Finally, after running a top speed of 180 mph, the cops showed up. The owner sent a video of the endeavor to his producers, who promptly locked the car away, never to be seen again until years later when his friend uncovered the forgotten muscle car.</p>

<p>Nowadays, this powerful beast boasts a massive 426 ci Hemi V8 engine, which was built to be the best engine design in its day. This spins the skinny tires with over 510 horsepower and sends the car into the perfect range for 5-mile speed runs. While it’s unclear what the Charger’s top speed is now, we know it is still explicitly built for speed rather than acceleration. This explains the aerodynamic wheel covers, stiff suspension, and extremely tall gears allowing it to cruise at ridiculous speeds.</p>
