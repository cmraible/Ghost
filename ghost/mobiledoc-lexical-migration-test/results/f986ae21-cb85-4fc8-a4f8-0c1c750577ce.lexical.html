<hr>
<p>The 24th annual <a href="https://cruisinthecoast.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Cruisin' The Coast</a> event is rapidly approaching, but if you haven't signed up yet or started planning your trip to America's Largest Block Party, there is still plenty of time to do so. This weeklong event descends upon Biloxi, Mississippi in early October delivering a little something for automotive enthusiasts young and old, and it culminates with a three-day <a href="https://vicariauction.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Vicari Auction</a> event that will see more than 800 cars cross the auction block.</p>

<p>Cruisin' The Coast runs from October 4-11 with full seven days of activities planned. These include parades, cruise-ins and autocross events, while various live entertainment and competitions – including a flame-throwing competition on October 6th! – are sure to keep attendees and participants entertained. Putting the "cruisin'" in Cruisin' The Coast, these events are spread across several venues lining Mississippi's Gulf Coast – hence the nickname of America's Largest Block Party – such as D'Iberville, Pascagoula and Ocean Springs, and last year more than 8,600 cars were registered for festivities. This year, Dennis Gage from <em>My Classic Car</em> and Courtney Hansen, who has previously appeared on <em>Overhaulin'</em>, will be making appearances at the different locations.</p>
