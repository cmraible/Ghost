Thanks to the Back to the Future trilogy, most of the public thinks these 80s sports cars are pretty hot. In actuality the V6 engines not only propelled the thing from 0-60 in over 10 seconds, they’re known for being pretty unreliable. For the movie, the film crew did an engine swap on the stunt car, dropping in a Porsche V8 for that extra gusto."
