However, pretty much everyone will agree a Ferrari 412 P race car isnâ€™t exactly your run-of-the-mill Prancing Horse. After all, the 56-year-old ride is quite rare at only four made and desirable among collectors. That makes Ferrari Classiche, the restoration and certification division in Maranello, announcing it restored one of these "

Ferrari created the customer car by taking the chassis from a 1966 P3 prototype and putting the body from a 1967 P4 on it. The combination is quite fantastic, and combined with the rarity factor adds a certain wow factor to the car."
