According to a local news report out of Memphis, Tennessee, a man is facing charges for allegedly stealing a 1976 Chevy Corvette after the owner passed away. A neighbor witnessed the man just loading it onto a trailer hitched up to a Ram pickup like it was nothing."

Thankfully, it only took police until October 14 to track down the ‘Vette, although a neighbor who was interviewed admitted they didn’t think it would ever be found."

It was sitting on the trailer being pulled by the Ram, which was parked by a house 3 miles away from where the ‘Vette was originally stolen. That’s where they found 34-year-old Christopher Atkins using a reciprocating saw to cut the catalytic converter off a minivan that was parked in the road. Atkins fled from officers but was quickly apprehended."

Oftentimes, criminals will steal one vehicle to then use it in the theft of other cars. We’ve seen this with trucks and trailers as well as tow trucks."
