Instead of scanning a barcode at the door, attendees snap photos of themselves and their faces, which become the tickets.  The selfie ticket is another way that TicketLeap is <span style=\"color: #252525\">focusing on treating event goers like people, rather than transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #252525\"><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/?attachment_id=38625\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38625\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-38625 size-medium\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/iOS5_1-169x300.png\" alt=\"iOS5_1\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/06/iOS5_1-169x300.png 169w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/06/iOS5_1-576x1024.png 576w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2014/06/iOS5_1.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" /></a></span></p>\n<p>TicketLeap is now getting into the act of throwing events itself, becoming it&#8217;s own customer.  In November, they threw their first event called &#8220;Create.&#8221;  The company got few local successful entrepreneurs together including Philly chef Scott Schroeder, Tom Kehoe (founder of <a href=\"http://www.yardsbrewing.com/about/crew\" target=\"_blank\">Yards Brewing Company</a>), Thaddeus Squire (founder of CultureWorks Philadelphia) and musician <a href=\"https://lucystone.bandpage.com//\" target=\"_blank\">Lucy Stone</a>.  The company got to experience their product as a user and has committed to throwing one event each month so they can continue to grow their community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The best way to build a connection with somebody is through events,&#8221; Raybould said.  &#8220;The effort seems higher than the benefit and what we&#8217;re trying to do is adjust both of those pieces of the chart and take the effort down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
