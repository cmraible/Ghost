The heart of this builder is a MAST Motorsports built blown LSX 427 cubic-inch engine that processes around 800-horsepower at the crank. Backing the beast of an engine is a TKO five-speed manual transmission, and the car rolls on a full Detroit Speed suspension. With this kind of powertrain, great braking power is absolutely needed, which comes from upgraded Baer brakes."
