That’s right, this event took place in St. Moritz, Switzerland, the place made famous for hosting the Winter Olympics twice. The frozen lake regularly hosts all kinds of events, including polo matches and horse racing, so it was only natural to use it for a car meet."

What’s more, many of the rides were quite impressive. For example, one of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 movie cars was there. So was the black Ferrari Testarossa Spider is the very same one famously used by Michael Jackson in a Pepsi commercial back in the day."
