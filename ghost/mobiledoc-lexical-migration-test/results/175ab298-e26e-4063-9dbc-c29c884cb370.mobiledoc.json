          "Back on the morning of September 5, Nickel’s Automotive Wood Restoration in Traverse City, Michigan was destroyed along with about a dozen cars in a devastating fire. The son of owner Michael Nickels received a phone call from his son since the security system alerted him to the fire. Nickels and his wife were camping out outside of town, so they jumped in their car and quickly drove to the business, but it was engulfed by flames in just over half an hour."

Nickels says he’s repaired the bodies on over 100 classic woodies, including some pretty high-profile vehicles. Not only was his shop obliterated in the inferno, so were customer vehicles and Nickels family heirlooms."
