<p>Subaru produced this small truck in a time when demand was at an all new high but they were late to the game. This resulted in the need to make <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/579/1984-subaru-brat?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ral421mot">the trucklet</a> stand out in a crowd and the Japanese automaker packed the model full of utility and personality atypical of the competition. Features such as an under-hood mounted spare tire, a Halo-twin roof, a dual-range four-wheel-drive, and a manually adjustable ride height were among the Brat’s best features. However, it was the rally-inspired stripe package and the unique rear-facing jump seats that garnered the most attention. Although many buyers opted to remove the seats and carpet from the bed in favor of more cargo space and less of a chance of rust.</p>
