The Syclone was an aggressively styled truck based off the GMC Sonoma. It featured a 280-horsepower turbocharged 4.3-liter engine backed by a 4L60 4-speed automatic transmission, a Borg Warner all-wheel drive transfer case, and a sport-tuned suspension. This combination of factory installed modifications to the small truck platform allowed the truck to accelerate to 60-mph in just 4.3-seconds and run through the quarter-mile in 13.4-seconds according to car and driver, though a ",
