<p>Corporate media loves a political horse race: Who’s in first place, who’s in second, and who’s being left in the dust. It’s why the vast majority of its coverage of the fight to pass the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package has simply parroted conservative Democrats’ <a href="__GHOST_URL__/manchin-bank-bailout/">asinine</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/dems-spin-control-over-pharma-cash-and-drug-pricing-vote/">excuses</a> for doing their corporate overlords’ bidding, or allowed these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-pick-the-one/">political turncoats</a> to avoid saying <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-senators-need-to-hear-from-their-constituents/">anything of substance at all</a>. As we explore in several articles in this edition of Weekend Reader, there’s a major problem with this approach. The general public ends up with no idea of what’s really at stake in these dumb political machinations: Whether or not we’ll improve the lives of millions of struggling Americans, and whether or not we’ll be able to save our planet from total disaster.</p>

<h3 id="stuff-we%E2%80%99re-reading">Stuff We’re Reading:</h3>
<p><a href="https://thecolumn.substack.com/p/the-actual-human-stakes-of-the-reconciliation?justPublished=true"><strong>The Actual Human Stakes of the Reconciliation Bill Are Being Ignored in Favor of “Left vs Moderate’ Horse Race Coverage</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Column) <em>— “While the bill is far from complete (nor do its climate change provisions come close to meeting the scientific reality of the carbon emission economy), it would be a massive improvement to the lives of millions of poor, elderly, Black and Brown, homeless, and vulnerable communities. But one would not know any of this watching television coverage of the ‘showdown’ over the bill between ‘progressives and moderates.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163867/manchin-sinema-climate-moderates-extremists"><strong>Let’s Call Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema What They Are: Extremists</strong></a> (The New Republic) <em>— “In a world already irreversibly altered by rising temperatures, there’s no moderate way forward. Back in 2014 — when there were tens of billions fewer tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  —climate scientist Kevin Anderson argued that the planet faced ‘an unavoidably radical future. We either continue with rising emissions and reap the radical repercussions of severe climate change, or we acknowledge that we have a choice and pursue radical emission reductions.’ Progressives want the latter, or at least the closest thing to it Congress is likely to produce in the next few months. Sinema, Manchin, Gottheimer, and their ilk are doing everything they can to make the former path a reality. No one should call them moderates, or even centrists. They’re extremists. If they have their way, they’re going to get a lot of people killed.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/kyrsten-sinema-fundraising-course-asu/"><strong>Kyrsten Sinema Is Literally Teaching A Course On Fundraising</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>“The syllabus, which was obtained by </em>The Intercept<em>, says students will ‘learn diverse fundraising strategies’ for nonprofits as well as ‘how to cultivate donors,’ including ‘large individual donors,’ by leveraging resources like ‘opportunistic fundraising,’ ‘finding supporters for major fundraising events’ — and, well, ‘asking for money.’”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/greenwashing-the-military-industrial-complex-craven"><strong>Greenwashing the Military-Industrial Complex</strong></a> (The Baffler) — <em>“Generals may profess faith in neoliberal dreams of solar-powered fighter jets, but the truth is that they won’t ever let go of dirty energy. The military demands power at its most punishing, a carbon footprint so heavy it can break necks. A clean world, in other words, is incompatible with a heavily militarized one.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163776/line-3-pipeline-feels"><strong>What It Feels Like to Have a Pipeline Cut Through Your Town</strong></a><strong></strong>(The New Republic) — <em>“Traveling the 340-mile Minnesota portion of the pipeline, I found clues about what (and who) caused some folks to numb their worries over Line 3 and accept it, while others fought to stop construction. I also noticed that every Minnesotan I spoke with, regardless of coping style or political leanings, was dealing with a sense of loss.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att/"><strong>How AT&T Helped Build Far-Right One America News</strong></a> (Reuters) — <em>“A Reuters review of court records shows the role AT&T played in creating and funding OAN, a network that continues to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic. OAN founder and chief executive Robert Herring Sr has testified that the inspiration to launch OAN in 2013 came from AT&T executives… Since then, AT&T has been a crucial source of funds flowing into OAN, providing tens of millions of dollars in revenue, court records show.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/11/can-nuclear-fusion-put-the-brakes-on-climate-change"><strong>Can Nuclear Fusion Put the Brakes on Climate Change?</strong></a> (New Yorker) — <em>“Let’s say that you’ve devoted your entire adult life to developing a carbon-free way to power a household for a year on the fuel of a single glass of water, and that you’ve had moments, even years, when you were pretty sure you would succeed. Let’s say also that you’re not crazy. This is a reasonable description of many of the physicists working in the field of nuclear fusion.”</em></p>
