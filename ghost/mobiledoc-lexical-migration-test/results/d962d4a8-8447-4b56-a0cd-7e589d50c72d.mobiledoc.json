Yesterday was also the day I was expecting my <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MJ5F2/42mm-milanese-loop\" target=\"_blank\">Milanese Loop band</a> to be delivered from Apple. So as you can imagine the fact that I knew when I got home yesterday I&#8217;d be welcomed by my shiny brand new Apple Watch band is what kept me sane throughout the day at jury duty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-watch-milanese-loop.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-42580\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-watch-milanese-loop.png\" alt=\"apple-watch-milanese-loop\" width=\"200\" height=\"174\" /></a><p>\nAnyway, at about 3PM I got a notification saying it had been delivered. Yay! When I finally got home, I went directly to the package room and started looking around for the delivery&#8230;only I couldn&#8217;t find it. Immediately I thought the worst: someone either mistakenly took it and I have to wait for them to realize and put it back or the delivery person didn&#8217;t actually deliver it or any other of number of possibilities. Needless to say, I was mad. So mad in fact, I started calling the delivery company and also started a chat with Apple support at the same time.</p>\n<p>While I waited for the delivery company to pick up the phone, I began chatting with a woman at Apple named Holly. Here&#8217;s our correspondence:</p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-42574\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1.png\" alt=\"apple-customer-service-1\" width=\"800\" height=\"1978\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1.png 974w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-121x300.png 121w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-414x1024.png 414w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-6x16.png 6w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-13x32.png 13w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-11x28.png 11w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-23x56.png 23w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-1-26x64.png 26w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-42575\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2.png\" alt=\"apple-customer-service-2\" width=\"800\" height=\"1978\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2.png 974w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-121x300.png 121w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-414x1024.png 414w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-6x16.png 6w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-13x32.png 13w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-11x28.png 11w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-23x56.png 23w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-2-26x64.png 26w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-42576\" src=\"__GHOST_URL__/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3.png\" alt=\"apple-customer-service-3\" width=\"800\" height=\"2050\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3.png 918w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-117x300.png 117w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-400x1024.png 400w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-6x16.png 6w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-12x32.png 12w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-11x28.png 11w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-22x56.png 22w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2015/05/apple-customer-service-3-25x64.png 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a>At no point during my chat with Holly did the delivery company pick up the phone, but I&#8217;m sure if they did it wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as pleasant to talk to them as it was to talk to Holly. So, thank you Holly. Thank you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
