The front-engine Porsche 944, and the 924 before it, are the black sheep of the Porsche lineup. With their water-cooled engines that were mounted at the wrong end of the car, they were deemed less worthy of the Porsche Badge.

They have been beaten and abused, raced and engine swapped. In short they were never expected to be worth anything, so they were treated like they were worthless. Now, to find a pristine and unmolested early 944 is akin to finding a white peacock."
