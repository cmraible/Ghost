<p>Late last week, after <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/joe-manchin/">Sen. Joe Manchin</a> (D-W.Va.) obliterated much of what was left of President Joe Biden‚Äôs agenda by refusing to support his party‚Äôs scaled-back social safety net, climate, and tax package, some observers wondered what was in it for Manchin, the corporate Democrat who holds all the power in the divided Senate. </p>
<p>As <em>The Lever</em> has previously documented, the Democratic rotating villain role that Manchin is playing typically ends with a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/conservative-democrats-lucrative-career-path/">cushy landing spot on K Street</a> working for big business. That‚Äôs certainly already true for one of Manchin‚Äôs longtime aides. </p>
<p>Jonathan Kott went from working as Manchin‚Äôs senior advisor to leading a well-funded dark money group that spent millions to crush Sen. Bernie Sanders‚Äô (Ind.-Vt.) 2020 presidential bid, and then back to Capitol Hill. Now, Kott is a corporate lobbyist for health insurers, drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, and Fox News, while the media calls on the so-called ‚Äú<a href="https://twitter.com/reidepstein/status/1473471440468922368">Manchin whisperer-for-hire</a>‚Äù to offer commentary about what has motivated his former boss to repeatedly obstruct his party‚Äôs agenda.</p>

<p>Kott‚Äôs path through Washington‚Äôs proverbial ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù showcases the lucrative career opportunities available to Democratic Hill staffers: If you work for conservative Democrats who protect corporate interests and loyally attack progressives, corporate America will come calling with a big bag of cash.</p>
<p>Kott did not respond to <em>The Lever</em>‚Äôs request for comment.</p>
<p>The trend of those working in Congress ‚Äî whether as lawmakers or aides ‚Äî leveraging their Capitol Hill connections and experience to work on behalf of wealthy special interests is not new, and the phenomenon has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/1/15/10775788/revolving-door-lobbying">grown over time</a>. The pattern is a stark reminder of the disingenuousness of the political establishment, which purports to prioritize the needs of constituents while getting rewarded by corporate interests for preserving the status quo.</p>
<p>A 2019 <em>Public Citizen </em><a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/revolving-congress/">study</a> found that nearly two-thirds of lawmakers who had retired or were defeated at the ballot box went on to work in the influence industry. Nearly 60 percent of these former members of Congress had taken up work for lobbying firms, consulting firms, trade organizations, or business groups to influence ‚Äî and impede ‚Äî federal government action.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, staffers who move to K Street are likely to earn more money based on how many personal connections they retain on Capitol Hill, according to a <a href="https://www.legbranch.org/2017-8-21-cashing-in-on-connection-for-congressional-staff-turned-lobbyists-who-you-know-matters/">2017 study</a>.</p>

<p>Kott‚Äôs career path is a cautionary tale of how our political system ‚Äî and its perverse incentives ‚Äî chews up bright-eyed, bushy-tailed individuals who think they can effect change in the lives of real people through public service, only to get swept up in the game of trying to profit off their public sector experience through protecting the interests of the elite.</p>
<p>Kott‚Äôs <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/560632-top-manchin-coons-aide-heads-for-k-street/">career in public service</a> began with an internship in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), where he worked to address homelessness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I went to HUD, I realized I could help homeless people get a place to live, and that‚Äôs what I thought I would spend my time in politics doing,‚Äù he told <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/560632-top-manchin-coons-aide-heads-for-k-street/"><em>The Hill</em></a>. ‚ÄúBut I got drawn into the press side, and that‚Äôs where I wound up.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kott went on to intern for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and then served as a press aide for the presidential campaign of former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, the most notorious <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/midday-poster-one-villainous-joe-crowns-another/">rotating corporate villain</a> of the Obama era.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/560632-top-manchin-coons-aide-heads-for-k-street/"><em>The Hill</em></a>, Kott then went to work for the corporatist think tank Third Way, where <a href="http://www.capitolcounsel.com/team/jonathan-kott/">he apparently</a> ‚Äúhelped craft moderate messaging and policy.‚Äù Kott <a href="https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/560632-top-manchin-coons-aide-heads-for-k-street/">got the job</a> by contacting Third Way co-founder Jonathan Cowan, who ran HUD while Kott interned there.</p>
<p>By 2013, Kott was back in the public sector, working as the communications director for Manchin, the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/03/joe-manchin-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/">coal-baron-turned-senator</a>. For some time, he simultaneously worked for both Manchin and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a conservative Democrat and close Biden ally. Kott would go on to serve as Manchin‚Äôs senior advisor, too.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2019, Kott left Manchin‚Äôs office, according to Legistorm. He soon founded the Big Tent Project Fund, a dark money group focused on crushing Sanders‚Äô presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The nonprofit spent <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/independent-expenditures/?data_type=processed&most_recent=true&committee_id=C90019175&is_notice=true">$4.8 million</a> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=112739086975178&search_type=page&media_type=all">digital ads</a> attacking Sanders, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=100926438191751&search_type=page&media_type=all">including those</a> under the name United We Succeed. The ads <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=112739086975178&sort_data[direction]=desc&sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&search_type=page&media_type=all">criticized</a> Sanders as a socialist who wanted to increase taxes on the middle class, saying that voting for him would mean Americans ‚Äúlosing our private health care.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kott <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2020/02/19/the-dem-ad-campaign-aimed-at-taking-down-bernie-488357">told <em>Politico</em></a> of the ad campaign: ‚ÄúDespite over 50 years in public life, Bernie Sanders has never been fully vetted. The Big Tent Project will shed light on his record of politically toxic policy proposals starting in Nevada and South Carolina.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based campaign finance group, <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/document/clc-complaint-fec-against-big-tent-project-fund">filed</a> a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in 2020 alleging that the Big Tent Project Fund‚Äôs primary purpose was defeating Sanders, and the group had thus violated election laws by not registering as a political committee and not publicly disclosing its donors. CLC last year <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/clc-complaint-alleges-fec-failed-take-action-against-secret-money-group">sued</a> the FEC for failing to take action.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22089794-big-tent-project-fund-990-2020">copy of its tax return</a> obtained by <em>The Lever</em>, the Big Tent Project Fund raised more than $12 million in 2020.</p>
<p>While the organization is not required to disclose its funding sources, its tax return makes clear it was financed by just a dozen donors. More than 80 percent of its cash came from just three donors who gave at least seven figures, including one who donated more than $6 million.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/ghost-integration/60818189ad12f332071054b8/tips" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Tip Jar</a></div>
<p>In addition to its anti-Sanders ads, the Big Tent Project Fund reported donating nearly $3 million to <a href="https://www.centeractionnow.org">Center Action Now</a>, a dark money group <a href="https://www.centeractionnow.org/about">created</a> by Tim Miller, a past campaign aide to Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>Center Action Now‚Äôs <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=108478014052676&search_type=page&media_type=all">digital ads</a> were designed to target center-right Republicans and independents with messages attacking Sanders and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-lincoln-project-got-attention-but-these-never-trumpers-got-results">boosting</a> then presidential candidate Joe Biden as the moderate choice. Some of the ads contained general messages encouraging people to vote. The group never filed independent expenditure reports with the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>The Big Tent Project Fund also reported donating $1.3 million to the Progressive Policy Institute, a corporate-aligned, ostensibly centrist think tank.</p>
<p>The only independent contractor Big Tent Project Fund listed in its tax return is a Delaware-based company called CMP Partners, LLC, which Big Tent paid $4.9 million. According to Delaware incorporation documents for CMP Partners obtained by <a href="https://twitter.com/annalecta/status/1258784280651673604">OpenSecrets</a>, the company <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6819418-238612919-512020-095101">listed</a> ‚ÄúTerrence Walsh‚Äù as its authorized representative.</p>
<p>Terrence Walsh appears to be Terry Walsh, president of the <a href="https://strategygroup.com/team/">The Strategy Group</a>, who was a top campaign advisor to former President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>CMP Partners‚Äô only other appearances in FEC <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/independent-expenditures/?data_type=processed&most_recent=true&is_notice=true&payee_name=cmp+partners">records</a> have been related to two additional outside groups attacking progressive candidates: The company handled direct mail for Americans For Tomorrow‚Äôs Future, a super PAC that attempted to defeat Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in the 2020 primary, and also ran digital ads for Third Way against <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-business-is-coming-out-against-nina-turner/">progressive</a> Nina Turner in 2021, according to FEC <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/independent-expenditures/?data_type=processed&most_recent=true&is_notice=true&payee_name=cmp+partners">independent expenditures filings</a>.</p>
<p>Walsh did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>After the 2020 primary campaign, Kott returned to Capitol Hill, serving once again as a top aide to Coons. He soon decamped for K Street, becoming a partner at the corporate lobbying firm Capitol Counsel last June.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJon was a very effective communications director and trusted senior advisor for seven years,‚Äù Manchin said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capitol-counsel-adds-former-manchin-coons-senior-advisor-and-communications-director-as-partner-expanding-offerings-301314799.html">press release</a> issued by the firm. ‚ÄúHe is a thoughtful communicator and tactician with a true understanding of the importance of bipartisanship. I‚Äôm excited for him to be taking on this new role.‚Äù</p>
<p>Coons, for his part, said in the press release, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve relied heavily on [Kott‚Äôs] candid advice, strategic insights, and vast media and political network. I wish him the very best in his new role at Capitol Counsel and look forward to maintaining our close friendship.‚Äù</p>
<p>In this new role, Kott has <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/search/?registrant=&registrant_country=&registrant_ppb_country=&client=&client_state=&client_country=&client_ppb_country=&lobbyist=kott%2C+jon&lobbyist_covered_position=&lobbyist_conviction_disclosure=&lobbyist_conviction_date_range_from=&lobbyist_conviction_date_range_to=&report_period=&report_year=&report_dt_posted_from=&report_dt_posted_to=&report_amount_reported_min=&report_amount_reported_max=&report_filing_uuid=&report_house_doc_id=&report_issue_area_description=&affiliated_organization=&affiliated_organization_country=&foreign_entity=&foreign_entity_country=&foreign_entity_ppb_country=&foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_min=&foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_max=&search=search">lobbied for</a> oil and gas giant ExxonMobil as well as the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobbying group that represents oil, gas, and chemical interests.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs also lobbied for the Healthcare Leadership Council, a group representing <a href="https://www.hlc.org/about/hlc-members/">prominent health insurers and drug companies</a><a href="https://americashealthcarefuture.org/about-us/">opposed</a> to universal health care, and pharmaceutical company Biogen. Kott‚Äôs work for Biogen has involved <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/484a842d-e8c5-4f71-9c06-82ffac3d4225/print/">lobbying on</a> efforts by Democrats to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.</p>
<p>In June, Kott <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/search/?registrant=&registrant_country=&registrant_ppb_country=&client=&client_state=&client_country=&client_ppb_country=&lobbyist=kott%2C+jon&lobbyist_covered_position=&lobbyist_conviction_disclosure=&lobbyist_conviction_date_range_from=&lobbyist_conviction_date_range_to=&report_period=&report_year=&report_dt_posted_from=&report_dt_posted_to=&report_amount_reported_min=&report_amount_reported_max=&report_filing_uuid=&report_house_doc_id=&report_issue_area_description=&affiliated_organization=&affiliated_organization_country=&foreign_entity=&foreign_entity_country=&foreign_entity_ppb_country=&foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_min=&foreign_entity_ownership_percentage_max=&search=search">registered</a> to lobby for Fox Corporation, the <a href="https://www.foxcorporation.com/">parent company</a> of Fox News, including on <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/fe3b9b95-74b5-458a-85cd-6c8eb6c299fc/print/">‚Äúcorporate tax issues.‚Äù</a></p>

<p>Kott is hardly the only recent example of a corporate Democratic aide who traded in public service for an influence industry gig. For instance, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema‚Äôs (D-Ariz.) former communications director John LaBombard left her office to become <a href="https://rokksolutions.com/news/rokk-solutions-welcomes-john-labombard-as-senior-vice-president/">senior vice president</a> at ROKK Solutions earlier this year ‚Äî moving from an office allied with the drug industry to a public relations firm that has <a href="https://prnewsonline.com/go/agency-elite-top-100-2021/?id=739480">worked</a> for Big Pharma.</p>
<p>While Kott now works as a corporate lobbyist, news outlets have regularly invited him on their programs to defend his former boss, Manchin, as the senator works to impede the Democratic Party agenda on issues like climate change and health care.</p>
<p>In a January <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-debate-erupts-after-former-bernie-surrogate-calls-manchin-a-soulless-coward-right-to-his-ex-advisers-face/">appearance</a> on CNN, Kott sought to explain away Manchin‚Äôs refusal to end the Senate legislative filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. This position puts Manchin on the side of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-filibuster-is-corporate-americas-kill-switch/">powerful corporate lobbying groups</a>, but Kott framed Manchin‚Äôs position as ‚Äúlooking to preserve how the Senate works and force them to work in a bipartisan way.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúSlogans and yelling isn‚Äôt the way it works.‚Äù </p>
<p>Kott told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-what-the-hell-joe-manchin-is-doing"><em>The Daily Beast</em></a> in April that Manchin ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt really care about party affiliation and is just focused on what he‚Äôs hearing from his constituents. And that‚Äôs basically how he handles his votes. He goes home most weekends. He talks to as many people as he can, comes back and decides how he‚Äôs gonna vote. And that‚Äôs basically what he does.‚Äù</p>
