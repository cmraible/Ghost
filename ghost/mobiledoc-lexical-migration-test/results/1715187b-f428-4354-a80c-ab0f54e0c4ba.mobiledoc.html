<p>The full-sized <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11363310&avId=987691&pageID=5">Chevy Suburban</a> SUV has actually been around for a lot longer than most people realize. Chevrolet introduced the model in the mid thirties, and it is the longest running moniker in automotive history. Often pulling in big sales, the early years of the Chevy Suburban came in the form of a what closely resembled a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-chevrolet-panel-truck-is-ready-for-your-collection/">panel truck</a> with rear windows and an added row of seats. By the time the 6th generation rolled around in 1967, the Suburban had rapidly evolved.</p>

<p>Examples like this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/japan-10-door-suburbans/">Suburban</a> are perfect versions that come out of the sixth-generation, a generation that saw rapid growth as popularity of recreational vehicles exploded. <a href="https://www.classiccarauction.us/inventory/car.php?id=11363310&avId=987691&pageID=5">Only 6200 Suburbans</a> were made in 1967, making this a pretty rare find.</p>
