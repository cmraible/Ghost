All of their cars were sharp and eye-catching, everything was about having fun, and there was always a party to attend. Knowing all of these things, you can see how much people weren’t exactly mavericks when it comes to handling money. That was pretty much exactly the case with the owner of this collection as it was once bought by a lottery winner who eventually went bankrupt somewhere down the line. So what kind of car might you expect a 1980s lottery winner to buy and showcase their extravagance?"

          "First of all, there are a lot of Ford fox body Mustangs in this collection. It’s actually quite impressive how many of these cars the owner managed to find. Most of those cars have been pretty ridden over the years now but there is one Ford that retains its good looks well kept despite having sat for God only knows how many years. That vehicle is what appears to be a 1966 Ford Galaxie 500, and a convertible at that. Overall, the owner of these vehicles clearly had some pretty great taste."

          "For anyone who is a fan of Chevrolet, the car enthusiast certainly had a couple of pieces that show their own love for that special kind of automobile. This certainly includes one stunning, but poorly kept, second generation Camaro. Cars like this one were meant for the open road of America and you can certainly tell it’s been driven more than a few times in its life. And overall, this fast collection of American sports cars can only really be described truthfully as iconic in every way. Nowadays, the cars are in serious need of restoration and who knows, maybe somebody will get these vehicles back on the road again someday. Until then, we’ll just have to wait to find out."
