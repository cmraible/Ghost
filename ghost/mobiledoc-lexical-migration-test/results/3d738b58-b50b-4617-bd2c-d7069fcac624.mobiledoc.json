          "Thanks in large part to the shortage of automotive microprocessor chips, there’s been a shortage of new cars in the past year, driving used vehicle prices sky high. In some extreme cases, this has resulted in some trucks, SUVs and even cars which are only a few years old selling for more than they did when brand new, leaving many shoppers in extreme sticker shock. While some have shelled out for the higher prices for a number of reasons, others have decided to hold out until sanity returns to the market. It looks like the price inflation bubble popping is now on the horizon, bringing both good and bad news, depending on where you sit."

As the market anticipates the increase in new rides, prices might adjust dramatically. While a 20-30% drop in prices will bring some needed relief, right now used car prices are 42% higher than they were in January of 2020. In other words, the decline could be more severe or it could come in several waves. That’s bad news for anyone who bought a used vehicle in the past year or so and is planning to sell it sometime in 2023."

The Japanese company won’t disclose how it’s doing so, but rumors about it sourcing chips from Apple and other theories have run rampant. Why other automakers haven’t figured out how to do the same isn’t clear, but hopefully they will soon."
