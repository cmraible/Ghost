<hr>
<p>Even in stock form, a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/caged-2013-chevrolet-camaro-zl1/">Chevrolet Camaro ZL1</a> is a serious <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle car</a>, with some arguing it’s more of a supercar. That second point might be debatable, but there’s no arguing that this particular <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/camaro-zl1-hennessey/">ZL1 modified</a> by Vengeance Racing is something to be respected. With more than 860-horsepower on tap, it should be obvious this Chevy should really only be driven by those with plenty of experience using <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hertz-corvette-camaro/">high-powered, rear-wheel-drive cars</a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t already know, Chevy blessed the ZL1 with the same 6.2-liter V8 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hertz-corvette-camaro/">used in the C7 ZO6</a>, only with a supercharger added. Add to that $30,000 in upgrades from Vengeance Racing, which included all kinds of internal parts like a more aggressive cam, hardened pushrods, C5R timing chain, etc. A meaner 2.9-liter Whipple supercharger was bolted up top, a Roto-Fab ZL1 Big Gulp cold air intake has been added, Kooks headers help with the exhale, a B&B cat-back exhaust is in the mix, plus the ECU has been tuned to extract maximum performance out of everything. Plus this car has a Tremec six-speed manual transmission, so you get the full three-pedal performance experience.</p>

<p>Instead of going for a bunch of flash, this Camaro ZL1 has about as understated of a look as something of this caliber could possibly achieve. Silver Ice Metallic does a great job of showing off all the aggressive lines, while black accents add a sinister appearance without overdoing things. To keep everything looking nice, Ultimate Protection Film has been applied to the front and a ceramic coat protection has also been added.</p>

<p>Being a ZL1, the interior is far from what you get in an average Camaro. For example, there are nice Recaro racing seats and a flat-bottom steering wheel, two designs lifted straight out of motorsports. All those modern bells and whistles are included, like AC, cruise control, satellite radio, Apple CarPlay, and seat heaters/ventilation.</p>
