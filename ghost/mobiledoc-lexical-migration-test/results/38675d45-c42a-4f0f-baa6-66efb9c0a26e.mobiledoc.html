<hr>
<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-draws-c8-corvette/">C8 Corvette</a> owner recently posted video evidence of a Fremont Chevrolet technician taking his mid-engine sports car for a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thief-takes-audi-r8-joyride/">joyride on the freeway</a>. This is the sort of thing any enthusiast’s nightmares are made of, because you hope dealership employees would be <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/louisiana-officer-muscle-joyride/">professional enough</a> to not do this sort of thing. The whole joyride romp was captured on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-teases-c8-z06/">Chevrolet’s Performance Data Recorder</a>, so you not only get the video but also performance metrics, including speed.</p>
<blockquote><em>See how Chip Foose thinks he can improve the C8 Corvette design <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chip-foose-draws-c8-corvette/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>The video, which was taken on July 31 and is included with this article, shows the dealership technician <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-porsche-911-gt3-rs-approach-its-official-top-speed/">push</a> the C8 Corvette up to 148 mph while pursuing a Dodge Charger. The Fremont Chevrolet employee never catches up to the Mopar, which we’re sure will entertain some people.</p>

<p>More importantly, during the race, both cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/streets-racers-kill-11-year-old-girl/">put everyone on the crowded freeway at risk</a>. The drivers swerve in and out of lanes, cutting dangerously close to other cars multiple times, and of course aren’t bothering to signal. They’re both exceeding the speed limit by enough we’d bet a police officer could’ve arrested the drivers and impounded the cars.</p>
<p>After racing the Dodge Charger on the crowded freeway, you can hear the dealership employee screaming for joy while sitting on an off-ramp and later as he’s driving on surface streets. Then he pushes the mid-engine Corvette up to 76 mph on in traffic on the surface road. Apparently, he really likes hooning other people’s property, putting innocent drivers on the road <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fatal-corvette-crash/">at extreme risk</a> all for a few free thrills. We would be laughing at his idiotic chest-thumping were it not for the fact he’s been a reckless moron with a customer’s C8 Corvette.</p>

<p>According to the owner of the car, who’s identified on YouTube and MidEngine CorvetteForum as “tastysauce” he took the 2021 C8 Corvette 2LT Z51 to Fremont Chevrolet because of some trouble accelerating, stuttering when pushed. Also, the engine was making some odd noises. So, after fixing what was wrong with it, a technician took it out to ensure everything was working fine. He certainly tested out the acceleration issue in an extreme way, so it seems to have been fixed. However, he could’ve crashed the Corvette and/or caused a serious, possibly even a fatal accident.</p>
