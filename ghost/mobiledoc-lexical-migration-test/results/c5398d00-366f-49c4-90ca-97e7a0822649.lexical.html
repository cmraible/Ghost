<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-venom-775-is-a-supercar-disguised-as-a-tuned-ford-f-150/">Hennessey Performance</a> is always trying to squeeze more performance out of today's <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-audi-r8-hpe900-exotic/">cars </a>and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/hennessey-maximus-rocks-the-jeep-world/">trucks</a>, and that usually leads to interesting research and development tests. Such is the case when the Texas-based tuner got a hold of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-2020-shelby-gt500/">2020 Shelby GT500</a> and 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-heroes-36-corvettes/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> Z51 and managed to lay down some interesting baseline head-to-head speed runs.</p>

<p>Both American icons are impressive performance machines with the Corvette having the obvious price advantage starting at $59,995 for the base Stingray, while the Shelby starts $70,300. This Corvette does have the optional Z51 package that adds an extra $5,000 for equipment such as Brembo brakes, electronic limited slip differential, performance suspension, a performance rear axle and Michelin Pilot Sport 4S summer tires. The Corvette's mid-mounted 6.2-liter V8 is rated at up to 495 horsepower (when equipped with the performance exhaust) at 6,450 rpm, and the Shelby's 5.2-liter supercharged V8 delivers 760 horsepower at 7,300 rpm.</p>

<p>In a straight-up drag race, the lighter Corvette flies off the line opening up an immediate three-car advantage, but the added muscle of the Shelby allows it to catch up quickly by the time the 'Vette has hit fifth gear at just over 100 mph. In a 40 mph rolling start drag race, the Shelby's higher power and redline allows the Mustang to blow the doors off the Corvette.</p>
