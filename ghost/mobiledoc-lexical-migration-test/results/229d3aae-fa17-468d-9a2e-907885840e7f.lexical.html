<p>This 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible is, simply put, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ls6-1970-chevelle-ss/">pure distilled Americana</a> on wheels. No other car has become so emblematic of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/most-expensive-seats/">American exceptionalism</a>, especially in the postwar boom years. The car seen here fits the bill more than most. It's a bright red convertible, with a white top that matches the whitewall tires. Out back, you'll find a continental kit, and each wheel has an era-appropriate spinner hubcap on it, polished to the same shine as the rest of the chrome on this car.</p>

<p>When you think about performance trucks from GM, especially as it pertains to the 1990s, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-find-1991-gmc-syclone/">GMC Syclone</a> is probably the first model that comes to mind. However, the 1990 Chevrolet 1500 454 SS was one bad pickup. Ones like this example remind us what we miss about 1990s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-ram-1500-trx/">performance truck culture</a>.</p>

<p>hanks to the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/paul-walkers-nissan-skyline-r34/"><em>Fast and Furious movies</em></a> as well as racing video games, a fair number of Americans know the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/wrangle-godzilla-with-this-2001-nissan-skyline-gt-r/">R34 GT-R</a>. But, since it’s next to impossible to import one for street use here, these cars <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">really stand out</a>. What’s even better, this one is for sale and has the EPA and DOT releases, so the dealer claims it’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/8-coolest-jdm/">legal to register and drive</a> in all 50 states. This is a dream come true since the R34 is considered by many to be the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/gt-r50-by-italdesign/">best version of Godzilla</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been around quite a few impressive cars, but even as jaded as we are it’s always a treat to see a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/bid-on-a-2017-ferrari-laferrari-aperta/">Ferrari LaFerrari</a> in person. Seriously, photos don’t do these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-find-2015-porsche-918-spyder-weissach/">hybrid supercars</a> justice. They look fast and when they were built they were the fastest and most powerful production car <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-f40/">out of Maranello</a>. Plus, at $1.4 million they were ultra-exclusive, yet they sold out in no time. People were so hog-wild over these things they mobbed every website offering information and pictures when the reveal went live.</p>

<p>Unlike the mythical creature, though, looking at this Medusa won't turn you to stone. Either way, though, laying your eyes on it will stop you dead in your tracks. Back in 2014, the Medusa conversion process took eight weeks and cost $35,000. For roughly the price of a Mustang GT convertible, you could have had someone chop the roof off of your new Viper.</p>

<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/celebrities-who-can-appreciate-a-good-muscle-car/">Plymouth Superbird</a> is easily the single most recognizable car of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/featured/own-drive-crush-class-69/">the muscle car era</a>. With its aerodynamic nose cone and giant rear wing, it looked totally different than anything else out there.</p>
<p>The Superbird also featured air extractors mounted on the front fenders, and the rear window was also unique to the car. Underneath all of these modifications, though, the Superbird was a 1970 Road Runner.</p>
