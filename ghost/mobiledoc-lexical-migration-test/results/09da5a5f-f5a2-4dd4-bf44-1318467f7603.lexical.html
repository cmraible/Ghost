<p>The <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">Lost Corvettes</a> were things of automotive lore not too long ago. Stored in relative secrecy in New York City by a reclusive artist who purchased them from the man who won a VH1 giveaway contest, they finally have been restored and are heading to loving homes. Instead of just listing them online, Corvette Heroes has decided to <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">give each one away</a> in a national sweepstakes with the proceeds benefitting the National Guard Educational Foundation. Also, as a Motorious reader we’re providing more tickets for your generous donation <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">through this link</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, the first 10 winners were announced and they hail from 8 different states, showing the appeal of these Corvettes <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">spans far and wide</a>. If you already entered into the sweepstakes you’re not out of luck, because there are still 26 cars to give away and all non-winning entries from the first drawing are eligible for the second drawing, which will be held on March 31, 2021.</p>

<p>Among the cars still left to give away is a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette, which like the others has been beautifully restored. Of course, it’s not only the first model year of the ‘Vette but also the first-ever mass-produced fiberglass car in history. The design wowed the automotive world when GM took the wraps off at the New York Auto Show.</p>
<p>There’s also the ’56 Corvette, which wears the rare Cascade Green. It’s also famous since Jerry Seinfeld drove it for an episode of <em>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</em> with Jimmy Fallon as the passenger.</p>
