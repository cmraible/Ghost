<h3 id="what-is-the-best-size-rear-tire-i-can-put-on-it">What is the best size rear tire I can put on it?</h3>
<p>While the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rally-fighter-dodge-viper/">quarter panels</a> may have changed a little from the 1968-1974 production year, the wheel wells remained largely the same. Therefore you can take this advice as long as you have a car that was made in those 6 years. The most common tire size for these cars is 275/60/15. While most say that 5.5 inches of backspacing are ideal, 5 inches seems to work just fine without a spacer, though if you're looking for maximum traction, 5.5 will probably be best.</p>

<h3 id="is-my-car-equipped-with-the-ss-package">Is my car equipped with the SS package?</h3>
<p>For the 1972 production year, the VIN will feature a K as the 5th digit on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/slew-of-barn-finds-in-blue-ridge-turn-up-on-craigslist/">SS cars</a> only. This means that under the hood is the infamous L48 engine which only came with the SS package.</p>
<h3 id="if-i-have-a-1973-1974-nova-can-i-swap-the-front-bumper-with-one-from-1968">If I have a 1973-1974 Nova can I swap the front bumper with one from 1968?</h3>
<p>While the hoods are different due to the more pointed shape of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1973-chevrolet-nova/">1973 model</a>, the fenders are an exact match. The front bumper will bolt directly onto the car without issue, the same cannot be said for the rear but that is another story.</p>
<h3 id="if-i-need-a-new-subframe-what-will-fit-my-car">If I need a new subframe, what will fit my car?</h3>
<p>All production subframes from 1968-1974 are interchangeable with very slight differences. It is also worth pointing out that all subframes from the 1967-1969 Camaro will also fit the 1968-1974 Chevy Nova.</p>
<h3 id="what-rear-ends-will-fit">What rear ends will fit?</h3>
<p>The 1967-<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1969-camaro-rs-convertible/">1969 Camaro</a> shares a rear end, as is usually the case with GM cars, this also applies to any Nova made from 1968-1979. However, you’ll have to make sure that the leaf springs will also fit as how many springs you have may vary.</p>
<h3 id="which-rear-end-is-my-car-equipped-with">Which rear end is my car equipped with?</h3>
<p>There are three available options, these are the 8.2 10-bolt, the 12-bolt, and the 8.5 10-bolt. To tell the difference between the 10-bolts you just need to look under it, on the 8.5 you’ll find a triangular bottom on either side and the 8.2 will be completely round. The 12-bolts are very easy to identify by just counting the number of bolts.</p>
<h3 id="what-size-seats-can-i-use-for-my-car">What size seats can I use for my car?</h3>
<p>The bench seats on 1968-1974 Novas are completely interchangeable, however, bolt patterns may differ for bucket seats.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-i-need-to-do-a-big-block-swap-to-my-nova">What will I need to do a big block swap to my Nova?</h3>
<p>Of course, you’ll need your big block however there is much more to it than that. The job will also require big-block frame mounts, headers, and front accessories. You’ll also probably need a thicker radiator, be careful because this swap puts the engine closer to the passenger side of the car thereby shifting its weight.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-get-aftermarket-parts">Where do I get aftermarket parts?</h3>
<p>You’ll need to do some research and measurement on your own, your best bet will be to ask fellow Nova owners on online forums and the like for their advice.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-get-parts-for-my-1973-1974-nova">Where do I get parts for my 1973-1974 Nova?</h3>
<p>Most of the performance and mechanical parts will fit from ‘68 to ‘74, however, the interiors are extremely different and most of the bodywork from the A-pillar back will not fit.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emf_6FMJMsY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
