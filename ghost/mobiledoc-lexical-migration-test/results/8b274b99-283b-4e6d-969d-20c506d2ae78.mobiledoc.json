Case in point: TikTok “star” Damaury Mikula purposely goaded Florida Highway Patrol troopers into chasing him in his Dodge Challenger, then proceeded to go 100 mph before getting arrested."

Troopers stated he then ran the red light and sped off. The guy was obviously looking for trouble, going out of his way to find it."

We’re thinking the guy pulled off this stunt to try to push that number to 5 million so he can retire early in Bermuda. The guy already claims to make $400,000-$500,000 through social media, although it’s not indicated if that’s monthly, annually, or a lifetime sort of thing."

          "During the chase, Mikula actually ditched the cops. However, his license plate was clearly displayed on the Mopar, so even though he got away troopers showed up at his house. After being arrested and loaded into a car, Mikula proceeded to shoot his mouth off, admitting he knew the trooper was trying to pull him over but that he thought if he could outrun the cop he was in the clear. The Fox News report indicates he then bragged that he’s young and rich, plus he owns a fast car so that means he apparently can do whatever he wants. After that hot take, the guy continued to dig himself in further, saying he wanted to do something fun for a moment and it’s not going to cost him. Has he looked at maybe getting a wingsuit?"
