A purple powder coated frame contrasts with the raw aluminum fenders, saddlebags, side covers, and tanks. Patina brass trim, including the grips, pegs, and air cleaner add a curiously rustic quality to the design. A humongous front wheel adds to the aggressive nature of this ride, ensuring nobody will be able to ignore it, no matter where you roll."

For example, it uses an S&S prototype 132CI X-Wedge dual plenum throttle body, and there are only four in existence.  Custom front brakes and Performance Machine rear brakes allow for quick stops and excellent control on the road. A 6-speed Baker transmission and custom 2-inch open belt primary by Evil Engineering help put power to the road. The ISR hand controls with brass accents are from Sweden, adding a foreign flair to the build."
