With that in mind, we're sure most of you know about the band KISS, who shocked the world in 1977 with a mind-blowing boom in popularity that was unheard of at the time. That very same year, Paul Stanley purchased his first new car, a 1977 Chevrolet Corvette. Continuing the tradition, he also purchased a pristine 2020 Chevrolet C8 Corvette, which he described as \"drop-dead gorgeous\" he would later say it \"raised the bar\" in the automotive performance industry. So when Mr. Stanley got the chance to purchase a brand new 2022 Corvette Stingray, he took it. However, there was a significant issue for the rock star and car guy.",

Without a doubt, this likely increased the car's value significantly, and the options certainly helped too. Along with being a convertible, this car is also coated in a Red Mist Metallic Tint paint, which hints when he helped design a C7 Corvette for SEMA. Adding the high-wing option, Edge Yellow brake calipers, and unique front fascia design will yield one of the most valuable new cars of our time. So what was so wrong with the car that the rock legend would already plan to auction the Corvette off?",
