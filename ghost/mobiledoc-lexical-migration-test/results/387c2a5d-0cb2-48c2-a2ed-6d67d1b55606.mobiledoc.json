The burgundy paint looks factory fresh with no signs of fading or peeling, and the factory ground effects and gold wheels are still in place. Accenting the gold wheels, the gold decals and pinstripes add a nice touch, and the interior is just as clean as the rest of the car with almost no wear showing in the cabin. This car is a fully loaded example with tilt steering, factory gauges, air conditioning and power windows including the soft-close rear hatch."

With years of documented history and maintenance, it's obvious this IROC-Z was well cared for since it was brand new."
