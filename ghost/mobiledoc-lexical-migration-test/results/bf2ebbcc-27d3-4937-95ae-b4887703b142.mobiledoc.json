          "It used to be back in the day people would buy a Ford Crown Victoria that was white, black, or blue, add a few cosmetic mods, then try to make other drivers believe they were a cop. While that’s about as far as most Crown Vic owners went, some took it further and pulled over unsuspecting people using lights and a siren. Now that Dodge Chargers have become ubiquitous for police departments all over North America, these police impersonators have also switched to the four-door Mopar."

The Mopar driver came up to her car, asked for her license, ownership, and insurance, wanted to know where she was going, plus inquired if she was single. If that wasn’t a red flag, we don’t know what is."

Thankfully, this woman didn’t answer the personal line of questioning, asked if she was getting a ticket, and when the guy said she wasn’t, she drove off."
