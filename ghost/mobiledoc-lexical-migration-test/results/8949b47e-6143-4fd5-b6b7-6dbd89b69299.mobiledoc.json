Priced at a mere $810 for the base model or $1,355 for the top-of-the-line convertible sedan, it gave people a lot of bang for the buck. While Johnny Carson easily could have purchased a Rolls-Royce (and he did but his ex-wife took it) the man reveled in driving a machine like this, which says a lot about him. If you haven’t watched Leno’s video about it yet, you really should because it’s pretty interesting."
