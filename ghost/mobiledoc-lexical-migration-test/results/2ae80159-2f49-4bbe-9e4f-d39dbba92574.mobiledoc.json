During his tenure he helped create the Stratos, am amazing performance vehicle made from 1973 to 1978. The man assisted with building Group 4 and Group 5 rally racing versions of the car, which pushed the envelope with crazy turbocharged powertrains."

          "Ferrari realized Materazzi was a valuable asset, swooning him away from Lancia in the 1980s. At first the man was working on the Formula One Scuderia team while also helping develop several road cars. He worked on the 288 GTO, which originally was going to be a Group B racecar, but with the series suddenly cancelled by FIA had to repurpose it as a road-legal machine. Of course, his crowning achievement was working as chief engineer of the venerable F40, a development process over which Enzo himself was heavily involved."

That project didn’t make it far. Still, the influence of Materazzi on the automotive industry will be felt for some time."
