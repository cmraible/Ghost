Unfortunately, this place is so overgrown that you may miss the incredible history it holds if you aren't paying attention. Even more pieces of automotive legend sit around the property. Still, one particular set is a three-piece group consisting of two Challengers, a convertible, and a Plymouth Satellite. These are interesting because they seem to be under a porch which really leaves you wondering what they were doing under there, to begin with.",
