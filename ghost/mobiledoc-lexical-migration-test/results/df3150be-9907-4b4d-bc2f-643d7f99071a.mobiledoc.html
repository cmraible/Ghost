<p>Mild tweak to the format this week. I'm still trying to figure out in my mind how <em>One Man & His Blog</em> and <a href="https://www.engagedreadingtime.com"><em>Engaged Reading Time</em></a> work together. I'm going to play with one lead story and a few supplement ones here, for a while at least. Let me know what you think. </p>
<h3 id="-country-walking-into-subscriptions-growth">(Country) Walking into subscriptions growth</h3>
<p>This is a great piece about how <em>Country Walking</em> magazine has harnessed the power of its community to boost subscriptions. At the heart of it has been the #walk1000miles campaign to encourage readers to set themselves a health goal of, well, walking 1000 miles over a year. </p>
<p>It's a lovely story at the intersection of social media, offline community management and a print publication. Getting the face-to-face element right is critical, because if you blow that, you can destroy a relationship built up over years (as I discovered myself last week — something I might eventually blog about).</p>
<p>This is <em>real</em> audience engagement at work.</p>

<h3 id="audio-news-gets-algorithmic">Audio news gets algorithmic</h3>
<p>Despite Nic Newman's best attempts to persuade me, I'm still skeptical of the value of news on smart speakers - and this feels like it'll just recreate all the problems of the social platforms. </p>
