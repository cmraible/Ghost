<p>In Austin, Texas, the average rent has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/where-is-rent-most-expensive-austin-nyc-apartment-prices-surge#xj4y7vzkg">surged</a> 108 percent year over year. In New York City, rent has skyrocketed 41 percent. In Salt Lake City, it‚Äôs increased 40 percent. In Portland, Oregon, it‚Äôs 32 percent. Since mid-March of 2020, there have been just over one million <a href="https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/">evictions</a>, with 6,613 in the past week alone. There were already half a million people <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-2021/">experiencing homelessness</a> nationwide in January 2020, and inflation and the pandemic have only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/03/inflation-homeless-rent-housing/">exacerbated</a> the problem.</p>
<p>Clearly there‚Äôs an enormous housing crisis. But what is causing it? And how can we address it?</p>
<p>Give us five minutes of your time to read this new edition of Cheat Sheet. We will explain the roots of the problem ‚Äî and what can be done to help.</p>

<h3 id="high-demand-and-no-supply-it%E2%80%99s-more-complicated-than-that">High Demand And No Supply? It‚Äôs More Complicated Than That</h3>
<p>Some say the housing crisis is caused by increasing demand and inadequate supply, indicated in part by low vacancy rates. But while the San Francisco Bay Area has been experiencing an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/15/san-francisco-mayor-breed-says-city-faces-remote-work-challenge.html">exodus</a> of high-income renters thanks to the rise of remote work, the drop in demand hasn‚Äôt had much impact on housing costs in the region. Bay Area rents, while slower to rebound to pre-pandemic levels, are still obscenely high, at an average of $3,230 per month.</p>
<p>Plus, rents are going up even in places with high vacancy rates. Vermont, for example, has the highest vacancy rate in the country, at nearly 23 percent, <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/vacancy-rates-study/">according</a> to LendingTree. But rents are still very high, with $2,500 for a two-bedroom being common. Homelessness has <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2022/02/07/vermont-among-highest-homelessness-increases-2021-hud-data-shows/6688257001/">exploded</a> in the state, and the situation is putting stress on social services.</p>
<h3 id="no-rent-control">No Rent Control</h3>
<p>A more prominent culprit in the housing crisis is the near total absence of rent regulation in the U.S., as well as nonexistent vacancy taxes, which would tax empty homes to collect revenue for affordable housing and incentivize landlords to not leave them vacant for investment purposes.</p>
<p>Across the country, many cities, towns, and counties are prevented from implementing rent control policies that would cap annual rent increases at moderate amounts. In 1994, Massachusetts <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Rent_Control_Prohibition_Initiative,_Question_9_(1994)">banned</a> all local rent control ordinances. The following year, California <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=5.&part=4.&chapter=2.7.&article">banned</a> new rent controls. Many other states prevent municipalities from doing essentially anything to regulate rent prices without state approval.</p>
<p>In New York, meanwhile, judges have watered down recent rent control legislation, leading to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.nysfocus.com/2022/07/19/judges-watering-down-eviction-protections-for-lawful-occupants/">thousands</a>‚Äù of additional evictions. Democrats in the state have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/21/realestate/good-cause-eviction-renters-new-york.html#:~:text=Under%20current%20law%2C%20landlords%20are,pay%20rent%2C%20or%20other%20infractions.">sat on their hands</a> on good cause eviction legislation, which would require that landlords have a valid reason to end tenancies, like nonpayment of rent, in addition to capping rent increases at 3 percent annually.</p>

<p>The ongoing, systemic failure by governments to protect renters is largely attributed to the power of the real estate industry, which <a href="https://prospect.org/power/blackstone-spends-huge-kill-california-rent-control/">spends</a> and <a href="https://www.fingerlakes1.com/2022/04/21/biggest-real-estate-lobby-wields-major-influence-over-rent-and-housing-issues-in-new-york/">lobbies</a> heavily to derail rent regulations.</p>
<h3 id="not-enough-affordable-housing">Not Enough Affordable Housing</h3>
<p>There‚Äôs also a massive underinvestment in affordable housing, which would increase the supply of high-quality homes for low- and moderate-income people. <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/09/25/luxury-apartments-get-the-tax-breaks-meant-to-boost-low-income-areas">Many</a><a href="https://alignny.org/press/how-your-tax-dollars-are-wasted-to-build-luxury-apartments/">of</a> the public subsidies for housing are for higher-cost options, not low-income housing.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://publicplansdata.org/quick-facts/national/">$360 billion</a> in public pension plan capital is invested in real estate, most of that money is going to high-fee, high-risk private equity real estate, which exists to either pump up asset values for expensive commercial and residential property, or to prey on those in the single family rental market by pursuing <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/african-immigrant-tenants-call-on-investors-to-help-stop-private-equity-firm-cim-groups-evictions/">aggressive eviction policies</a> and <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/07/12/invitation-homes-often-skipped-permits-as-renters-allege-shoddy-repairs/">failing to make repairs</a>.</p>
<p>Of that $360 billion, less than $7 billion is invested in the AFL-CIO‚Äôs <a href="https://www.aflcio-hit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-HIT-Annual-Report.pdf">Housing Investment Trust</a>, a low-risk bond fund that is currently building 7,223 housing units designed to be rented below market rate. If the full amount of public pension fund assets currently invested in real estate were instead invested in the trust, there could be 350,000 new affordable units in the pipeline in 2023.</p>
<p>This shift would substantially reduce the risk held by pension funds, generate tens of thousands of unionized jobs, and save retirement systems from paying billions of dollars in fees, much of which currently goes to anti-union and anti-pension billionaires.</p>

<h3 id="limited-public-housing">Limited Public Housing</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the federal government has been derelict in addressing the affordable housing crisis. At the height of the pandemic in 2021, the federal government spent <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/06/how-does-the-federal-government-support-housing-for-low-income-households">$90 billion</a> on low-income housing. By comparison, the latest annual military budget was more than eight times that, at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/pentagon-asks-for-715-billion-in-2022-defense-budget.html">$715 billion</a>.</p>
<p>One can‚Äôt forget the artificially constrained supply of government-funded public housing. Even <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2021/10/08/new-public-housing-hud-has-found-a-way/">with</a> the 1998 Faircloth Amendment, which capped the total number of public housing units, there‚Äôs room for 227,000 new units of public housing nationwide. The key problem is that local housing authorities charged with building new public housing tend to be influenced by developers who oppose such a move. There‚Äôs also been very little effort on the part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the White House for new public housing.</p>
<p>Finally, public housing funding is currently constrained by the budget cycle, which inhibits long-range planning. Instead, Congress could make such funding permanent.</p>
<h3 id="corporate-home-raiders">Corporate Home Raiders</h3>
<p>The outsized power of the financial industry plays a part in escalating housing costs. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/housing-market-investors/">One in seven</a> home purchases in top metro areas last year were made by investment firms seeking to rent or flip the properties. This state of affairs reduces the supply of homes for owner-occupied housing, and also allows for large-scale landlords to set rent prices across entire metro areas.</p>

<h3 id="don%E2%80%99t-forget-the-fed">Don‚Äôt Forget the Fed!</h3>
<p>Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve play a role in the housing crisis, too. Higher <a href="https://jacobin.com/2018/12/paul-volcker-federal-reserve-central-bank">interest rates</a> inhibit the flow of capital to everything by tightening the available supply of money and credit going into the economy. Tightening <a href="https://www.nahb.org/blog/2022/03/rising-interest-rates-construction-costs-exacerbate-housing-affordability/">interest</a> rates, as Fed Chair Jay Powell <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-fed-declares-war-on-workers/">is focused on</a>, will significantly reduce the supply of capital for new housing construction.</p>
<h3 id="some-governments-are-taking-action-%E2%80%94-but-is-it-enough">Some Governments Are Taking Action ‚Äî But Is It Enough?</h3>
<p>Some communities are responding proactively to the housing crisis. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka has launched <a href="https://abc7ny.com/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-corporations-buying-homes-real-estate/11817402/">initiatives</a> to prevent corporations from buying up housing. In Montgomery County, Maryland, County Executive Marc Elrich has <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/07/18/dc-md-va-rent-increases-covid-deals/">proposed</a> extending the pandemic rent increase cap in response to the area‚Äôs soaring housing crisis. In California, Berkeley is <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/07/11/berkeley-voters-may-see-rent-control-on-the-november-ballot">considering</a> expanding rent control, the cities of Santa Cruz and San Francisco <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/06/voters-to-decide-if-vacant-homes-should-be-taxed/">will include</a> a vacancy tax on their November ballots. In Boston, meanwhile, Mayor Michelle Wu is considering <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/housing/rent-stabilization">taking action</a> on rising rents.</p>
<p>But more broadly, there needs to be a cohesive federal approach. The pandemic eviction ban should be resumed and national rent control should be discussed. Congress needs to make aggressive new investments in housing, and large public-sector unions should be pushing pension funds to move their money out of private equity real estate and into the Housing Investment Trust.</p>
