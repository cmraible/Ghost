Some of these motives revolve around the history and stories behind the vintage vehicles we all know and love. While you could also make a case for performance and engineering, the earlier years of automotive design are mostly known today for high-value automobiles whose rarity and prestige make them the center of nearly every discussion. Sometimes these vehicles are found together as massive collections of similar cars, creating a spectacular find for any enthusiast with a passion for older design.",

But, of course, these aren't the only types of cars within this massive gathering, as a few Jaguar classics can easily be seen displaying their greatness. Nearly every generation of automotive design from the 1930s to the 1950s and '60s is featured in this collection. Some examples of this great variety include a classic Chevrolet Bel Air, what looks like a Thunderbird, and a convertible '65 Impala. There is something in this collection for every kind of classic automotive enthusiast out there, to be sure. ",

However, the most iconic of these has got to be the second generation 'Vette, which boasts a convertible top to better see the interior. We can't help but think that this must have been the perfect driver's car back in the day when it was still driving on the road regularly.
