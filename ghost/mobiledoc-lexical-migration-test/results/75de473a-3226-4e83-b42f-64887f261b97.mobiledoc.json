That means hundreds of trees must be cut down, which even with power tools translates into a lot of work. The guy takes it all in stride in a way that tells us he’s done this over and over, so to him it’s no big deal."

People who live in urban areas and rarely touch grass might not understand that in the country trees are everywhere and they grow like crazy, in some ways making them almost like weeds. You have to watch for any growing near your house’s foundation, driveway, or other structures because the roots can do serious damage. So clear cutting all these trees to keep the classic vehicles from deteriorating the rest of the way isn’t cruel or stupid, it’s necessary."
