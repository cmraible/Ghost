<hr>
<p>Shocking data provided by AMI Insurance in New Zealand indicates drivers under the age of 25 have their cars stolen “approximately three times higher” than the population average. That’s a concerning bit of information and leads to all kinds of questions. However, AMI says 26% of its car theft claims were filed by people 25 years of age or under, even though they’re under 10% of the company’s customer base, perhaps explaining why they get reamed on insurance rates.</p>

<p>The lazy explanation so many would run to is that the youth of today are stupid. Look, we’re old enough to remember in the 90s when Gen X was constantly flogged for being too rebellious and supposedly lazy. The same thing happened over a decade ago to Millennials. </p>
<p>Now it’s Gen Z’s turn to run the gauntlet of ridicule. But this sort of thinking not only is lazy, it leads to erroneous conclusions.</p>
<p>AMI dug into the data further and found something which should be obvious: younger drivers tend to own older, cheaper cars. This means they have a vehicle which is easier to steal than the new Audi their parents or grandparents might drive. </p>
<p>If you’re a car thief and you know anything, you’ll avoid the nearly-impossible-to-steal newer German luxury sedan and go for the easy-to-steal Kia even though it’s worth far less because it actually gets you paid.</p>
<p>Of course, AMI recommends covering good insurance coverage if you’re young and do drive a cheap, older car. That isn’t a bad idea, actually, but the company in its press release about these findings also recommends having an immobilizer installed and using a steering wheel lock. </p>
<p>They also counsel to not leave an idling car unattended and to take over basic precautions like locking the doors, not leaving valuables inside, and parking your vehicle in a secure garage. We think two GPS trackers wouldn’t be a bad thing to consider, either.</p>
