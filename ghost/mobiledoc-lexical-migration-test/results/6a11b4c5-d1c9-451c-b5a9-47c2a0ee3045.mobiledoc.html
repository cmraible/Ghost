<p>I found myself, the other day, wondering what had happened to Glinner. “Glinner”, as some of you may be aware, was the Twitter handle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Linehan">Graham Linehan</a>, a TV comedy writer, who recently was banned from Twitter.</p>
<p>In a happier, simpler social media age, he was on the edge of the Twitter crowd I moved with. But then, in a move that I’ll never completely understand, he took a more than JK Rowling-ish position on the transgender rights issue. He didn’t just express <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gender-critical_feminism">gender-critical views</a>, he made it the central plank of his online identity, tweeting about it night and day, until eventually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/27/twitter-closes-graham-linehan-account-after-trans-comment">Twitter wielded its little-used ban hammer</a>.</p>
<p>Would that be enough to break his obsession? </p>
<p>I suspected not, and did a little Googling. The first thing that turned up was <a href="https://glinner.co.uk">a Ghost-powered blog</a>.</p>

<p>That had been running since June of last year — but had abruptly ceased on July 14th this year. <a href="https://glinner.co.uk/a-week-in-the-war-on-women-monday-6th-july-sunday-12th-july/">The final post</a> gave no indication of why it was the final one.</p>
<p>Back to Google.</p>
<p>And I found him.</p>
<h2 id="from-twitter-to-substack">From Twitter to Substack</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/09/glinner-substack.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Guess where he’d landed? Yes, <a href="https://grahamlinehan.substack.com">Substack</a>, which is emerging as the go-to home of the cancelled. He’s clearly found a comfortable base there, publishing emails several times a day, with content utterly focused on his one political obsession. And where, unlike on Twitter, he has the opportunity to earn money from those supporters. As his about page reads:</p>
<blockquote>I’m putting everything I used to put on Twitter on this new website and more besides. Of course, there’ll be all the usual breaking news and views from the crystal mines of gender woo, but I’ll also be talking about music, gaming, writing, comedy, TV… And there may also be the occasional special treat! I’m hoping that if people like it, they might feel inclined to send me the price of a modest bottle of wine every month.</blockquote>
<p>Yes — he’s been driven off Twitter to a platform where he can monetise his campaign (which might be a necessity, given how much he’s talked about losing work through his politics) and where he’s less visible to his opponents. He, like other (perhaps less obsessive) people on the right are slowly building out an alternative media here, including figures including Andrew Sullivan and <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com">Jesse Singal</a> (another writer embroiled in the trans issue). Sullivan has implied he’s more than doubled his income through the move, which is eye-opening, instructive and slightly jealousy-inspiring, to be honest.</p>
<p>But, there’s a clear trade-off here.</p>
<p>The positive for them is the direct relationship with their audience, a less hostile atmosphere and the chance of direct financial support. The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/07/what-the-new-newsletters-can-learn-from-the-early-days-of-blogging/">negative is the discovery problems</a> I’ve talked about before. Sustaining the audience will be hard, and that has financial implications. But there's a more immediate one for someone as controversial as Linehan. </p>
<h2 id="can-you-be-cancelled-on-substack">Can you be cancelled on Substack?</h2>
<p>The big question is: will the same deplatforming campaign that drove Glinner off Twitter follow him to Substack — and how will Substack respond?</p>
<p>Well, I found the answer in the shower. Sorry for that image, but it’s true. I often just put my podcast app on “latest episodes” setting while I wash and see what comes up. In this case, it was the latest episode of the <em>Quillette</em> podcast.</p>
<p><em>Quillette</em>, for those not familiar with it, is a right-wing leaning site that often plays host to the sort of content that gets people, well, cancelled. This wasn’t one of the accidentally entertaining episodes, where Toby Young, self-appointed <a href="https://freespeechunion.org/about/who-we-are/">Lord of All Free Speech</a>, interviews a guest, and they tell him what an idiot he is, and how terrible his ideas are. (This happens with such regularity that I find it hard to believe it’s not intentional.)</p>
<p>And who was being interviewed by <em>Quillette</em>’s Canadian editor? <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/podcast-109-substack-founder-chris-best-on-how-the-humble-email-newsletter-is-saving-journalism/">Substack founder Chris Best</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the interview is about the crunchy detail of the underlying rationale for the site, and there’s some interesting if simplistic stuff in there about the similarities between the early days of blogging and the current days of newsletters. This is relevant, as you might imagine, to my interests.</p>
<h3 id="the-you-chose-this-defence">The “you chose this” defence</h3>
<p>But, eventually, host Jonathan Kay asks Best what he’ll do when the campaigners come to him, asking for people to be banned. I’ve transcribed his reply for you:</p>
<blockquote>We think about this a fair amount and I think the biggest thing we have going for us that is an advantage in what is a fraught space is that the nature of Substack is that you, as a writer, have a direct connection with your audience. They are coming and literally signing up for your newsletter. We don’t have, for example, a global feed with an algorithm that’s deciding what stories to show you. So, in general, if you’re reading something on Substack that you find objectionable, it’s because you signed up for it.</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on, more lightheartedly:</p>
<blockquote>Cancel culture’s fine. There’s a cancel button right in the email.</blockquote>
<p>And he’s knows that’s a trivializing reply:</p>
<blockquote>That sounds kinda glib, but it gives us a lot of leeway to say ‘look, we’re hosting writers and people that are signing up for the newsletters. We’re not foisting content on anyone else.”</blockquote>
<p>And he has a point. Substack’s problem — discoverability — is its strength here. Nobody has to see, say, Glinner’s email if they don’t want to. What that means in the long term, though, we don’t know. I find it hard to believe that the vehement opposition that Linehan has provoked will be happy to let him Substack away merrily undisturbed. Interestingly, Best makes it clear that they haven’t — yet — had any serious attempts to silence any of their writers.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave us?</p>
<h2 id="the-micropublication-media-landscape">The Micropublication Media landscape</h2>
<p>Substack is generating a new set of micropublications, many of which are going to pass under the radar of those who might have issues with what they’re writing, for good reasons or bad. For the time being, they’re not going to get the same critique that a public figure on Facebook or Twitter would.</p>
<p>Some of those micropubs will become self-sustaining or even profitable, allowing them to develop a deeper connection with those who agree with their perspective on the world. When that happens, others will follow their lead. Some will be even more controversial than Glinner. What if, God forbid, Milo Yiannopoulos reemerges on Substack?</p>
<p>There is clearly a storm brewing in Substack’s future, as they, through their cut of subscriptions revenue, will be profiting from these writers. Some people will clearly see that as profiting from hate, if people like Glinner build a profitable following there.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-media-dynamic">The new media dynamic</h2>
<p>There’s a serious point here: a new media dynamic is emerging around paid newsletters. It will have its good and its bad sides. It will be more agile, and harder to keep track of than traditional media. The more successful it becomes, the more the early adopter crowd will be supplanted by the more extreme voices. And subscribing to a newsletter about views outside the accepted norm is a lot less public than following such people on social media.</p>
<p>What new organisations will bubble up in newsletters?</p>
<p>Journalism is guilty of not taking things like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2015/01/chan-imageboards-culture-gamergate/">Chan culture</a>, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws">Gamergate and then the alt-right</a> were born, seriously enough early enough. I suspect we need to pay a lot more attention to what’s going on there. It might not be as sexy as penning another piece about TikTok. But then, the Chans weren’t as sexy as writing about Facebook, were they?</p>
<p>Perhaps, this time around, we might get ahead of the potential social downsides before things get as toxic as they have on other platforms.</p>
