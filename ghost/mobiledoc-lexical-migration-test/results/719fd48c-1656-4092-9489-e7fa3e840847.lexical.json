That's because, while it might look like  something from the 1930s or ‘40s, the car was originally built in 1979. On top of that, the odometer only reads around 5,000 miles which should also provide the new driver with plenty of confidence on the road. Altogether, this Clenet Series I could be described as one of the most iconic and unique vehicles to ever come out of the late 1970s. Of course, this stunning exterior is not the only important part of the vintage sports car as the powertrain proves.",
