<h3 id="the-pre-auction-evening-welcomes-car-enthusiasts-to-enjoy-over-100-vehicles-on-display">The pre-auction evening welcomes car enthusiasts to enjoy over 100 vehicles on display.</h3>
<p>We often look on in awe as classic and collector cars hit the auction blocks. These burnished specimens of perfection are frequently fought over before selling for sizable sums of money as the gavel falls. These vehicles are usually admired from a far by enthusiasts, but <a href="https://www.stlouiscarmuseum.com/" rel="noopener">St. Louis Car Museum & Sales</a> are giving you the chance to get up close and personal at a pre-auction open house event.</p>
<p>Taking place on May 3, 2019, 4pm - 8pm, is a huge open house display of over 100 classic and collector vehicles. Local and visiting enthusiasts of Missouri are encouraged to come along to the event where complimentary cocktails and hors d’oeuvres will be served to guests. You’ll be free to explore the 85,000+ square foot climate controlled complex in St. Louis, taking in some of the magnificent cars on display.</p>

<p>In addition to the vast number of notable vehicles on show, fans of automotive paraphernalia will love the huge amount of memorabilia  also on show. Everything from detailed die cast model cars and children’s ride-on toys, to vintage petrol pumps are sure to deliver on nostalgia.</p>
<p>Once St. Louis’ largest bowling alley, the building was bought by <a href="https://www.stlouiscarmuseum.com/" rel="noopener">St. Louis Car Museum & Sales</a> owner Joe Scott JR. He had been hunting for a building with no internal obstructions to display cars in a museum environment, but also have vehicles on consignment that people could actually buy. Today the museum hosts a vast array of astonishing vehicles for people to enjoy as a spectator, or maybe even as the new owner.</p>
