Ford really out-did themselves with this model, because when it comes to trucks this one just can't be beaten. It is astonishing that the owners were able to restrain the urge to drive this monster of a truck. Needless to say, whatever lucky soul that comes to own this in the future is going to have a heck of a good time."
