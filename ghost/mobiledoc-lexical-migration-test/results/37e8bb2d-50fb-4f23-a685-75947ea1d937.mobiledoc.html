<p>E-mail. No-one thinks of it as a social app. It’s hardly what we think of as Web 2.0, yet it’s the most social piece of software most of us use each day.</p>
<p>Oh, and it’s broken.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.computerweekly.com/blogs/enterprise-social-software/pics/2008/CRW_7400%20-%20Version%202.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2008/10/CRW_7400-Version-2-thumb-250x376.jpg?resize=250%2C376" alt="Suw Charman-Anderson" loading="lazy"></a></span>That, at least, was what <a href="http://suw.org.uk/">Suw Charman-Anderson</a> suggested at one of the keynote sessions of the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexberlin2008/">Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin</a> today.</p>
<p>She pointed out that e-mail has gone from something you needed a business case for a decade ago, to the first thing you get in a new job. And that’s creating a problem:</p>
<p>• 13% of people are getting more than 250 e-mails per day<br>• 56% of people think they’re spending too long on e-mail.<br><br>The reality is worse than that, she suggested, because we tend to underestimate our e-mail use.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is that e-mail alerts interrupt us – there’s a cost to that.</p>
<p>It takes us <strike>1m 44 secs</strike> 64 seconds to get our train of thought back after we deal with e-mail. *(The 1m 44s figure is for how long we take to process the alert. Thanks for the correction, Suw) *We can’t afford to spend a day a week figuring our what we were doing.</p>
<p>Psychologist have a term that describes our relationship with e-mail: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning">operant conditioning</a> – when we check e-mail, sometimes we get a nice one.That starts to create an emotional relationship with checking e-mail.  Scientists explore the idea by feeding rats when they press levers. Rats will press a lever five times, if that’s how often it takes to get food. But they get obsessed with lever-pushing when the food reward is random. That’s exactly relationship we have with e-mail. We keep checking it, in the hope that an emotionally-boosting one will come through.</p>
<p>Coupled with that, e-mail has become a proxy for work. Web working makes it difficult to judge how productive people are. If send lots of e-mail, <em>clearly</em> they’re doing lots of work – or so goes the thinking.</p>
<p>Together, these responses are rapidly eroding our productivity. So what’s the solution? You need to thhink about other ways of doing the same tasks – but with different tools.</p>
<p><strong>Document collaboration</strong> – doing this via e-mail, and merging it all at the end is one of the most soul-destroying ways of doing it. Using wikis is easier.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Information</strong> – Don’t e-mail it. Publishing blogs and make sure everyone uses RSS. There need to be RSS readers for everyone in the company –  a step that is often forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Short Conversations</strong> – use IM and chat for instant communication. E-mail makes conversations go on too long, as everyone feels need to be polite. IM conversations tend to be quick and to-the-point.</p>
