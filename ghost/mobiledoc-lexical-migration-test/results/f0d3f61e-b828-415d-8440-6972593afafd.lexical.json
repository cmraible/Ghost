That right there screams car thief, but we can’t say he stole the minivan or Bimmer for sure. However, it would bolster suspicion he was intended to carjack the Charger from the family, using deadly force if necessary. Likely, he stopped to see if the Mopar was in good enough condition to still take it after they crashed, then drove off once he realized the car was a loss. In other words, the guy is the lowest of the low.",
