When they were ordered with the 428 Cobra Jet, however, they became nearly unstoppable.</h3>
<hr>
<p>Back in 1969, someone ordered <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Mach 1</a> with the <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">mighty R-code 428 Cobra Jet</a> V8. They chose a four-speed manual to handle shifting duties, with a 3.50 Traction-Lok rear axle ensuring that all of that power made it to the pavement through both tires.</p>

<p>Ordered in the beautiful shade of Lime Gold, <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Mach 1</a> also came with a tilt steering wheel, rim-blow wheel, and power steering. This combination of options make this Mustang totally <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">unique among 1969 Mach 1s</a>. According to its included Marti Report, it's a <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">one-of-one car</a>.</p>
<p>This car was treated to a <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">rotisserie restoration</a>, and when the engine was rebuilt, it was treated to a few high-performance goodies. The block was bored .030 over, and Edelbrock aluminum heads with roller rockers were installed. The auction listing claims over 600 horsepower.</p>

<p>It appears that the heads were painted to match the engine block, leaving this mildly modified Mach 1 with a stock, <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=10803&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">freshly restored</a> appearance. You really do get the best of both worlds with this one.</p>
<p>This mega rare Mach 1 will be offered at <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignments-by-auction.aspx">Carlisle Auctions' Fall 2020 Auction</a> in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
