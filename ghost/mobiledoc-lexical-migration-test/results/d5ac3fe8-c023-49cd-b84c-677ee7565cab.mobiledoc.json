For example, the paint has a larger metallic property to it, so the effect is it appears to be more of a copper. But the powder-coated gold wheels are color-matched to the original."

While lots of power is great, the fact these cars are manuals makes them even more hardcore. Good luck getting your hands on them, because you’ll likely be looking at paying aftermarket prices once one of the original owners is done, and that most definitely will be big money you’re shelling out. Still, it might be worth it."
