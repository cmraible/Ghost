Throughout history, the famous Corvette has pushed boundaries, bravely entering into the most challenging and award-worthy competitions in the world in an attempt to prove itself as one of, if not the most, keenly designed and beautifully constructed automobiles ever produced. Thanks to the men who helped breathe life into the original and ensuing Corvette models, striving to make their once-in-a-lifetime dream of automotive perfection come to fruition, there are many top-shelf variations of America's Sports Car available today, and the rare opportunity to own some of the most significant ones is finally here,” According to Mecum."
