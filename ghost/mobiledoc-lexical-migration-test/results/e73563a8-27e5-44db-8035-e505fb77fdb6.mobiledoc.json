Originally purchased in Arizona in 1974, this 3.0CS remained with its original owner until 2012, and while it's not being claimed as having original miles, 46 years worth of receipts show that the 38,000-mile odometer reading is likely actual miles; the second (and current) owner has only driven the car about 2,500 since 2012! The condition of this car's Polaris Silver paint job, 14-inch alloy wheels and the Navy Blue interior are all a testament to the care this car has received since new."

This engine is fresh off a two-month rebuild that cost $11,525, which is almost as much as the $15,941 this BMW sold for brand new back in 1974! You don't see many of these 3.0CS coupes on the roads any more these days, and you certainly don't see them in such an amazing condition as this one."
