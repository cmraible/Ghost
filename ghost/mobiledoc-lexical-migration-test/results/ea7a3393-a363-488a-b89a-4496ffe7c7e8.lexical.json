While this is primarily a false assumption, we don't think we could have found a better example to fit that cookie-cutter stereotype than this buffoon. This dude epitomizes the phrase \"mess around and finds out\" with an ego fatter than the tires of a much faster bike and the skill of someone who had their training wheels taken off too soon. The humor of this situation lies not in the fact that he endangered himself and others, however. Instead, the reason he did it makes the icing on top of the cake that much sweeter.",
