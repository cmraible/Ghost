Vinyl and houndstooth seats complement the black and white themed interior perfectly and the dashboard is simple, with only a single gauge and a glovebox. A 1600cc flat-four engine utilizes twin-port cylinder heads, a point ignition, and a single-barrel carburetor to deliver about 57-horsepower to the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual gearbox. It is also equipped with a 12-volt electrical system and drum brakes."
