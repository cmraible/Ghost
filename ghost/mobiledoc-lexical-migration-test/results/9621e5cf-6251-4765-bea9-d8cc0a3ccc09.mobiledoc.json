Maybe he’s doing a huge media blitz and juggling a lot of interviews, which would explain why he sounded a little tired (or something like that). In the second half of the video you get to see Supercar Blondie talk to the director of F9. He explains that what he loves about the series is there are no boundaries. Considering they’ve played with magnets and gone into space, that seems self-evident at this point. So maybe Fast and Furious 10 will be about racing aliens or traveling back to the ancient Roman Empire where they can race chariots or something."
