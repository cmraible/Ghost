<p>If you were to create a Top Ten list of the most desirable cars ever built, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Shelby Cobra</a> would certainly be on there. You'd be hard pressed to find a car enthusiast who hasn't lusted after one.</p>
<p>The combination of a svelte British roadster and burly American V8 horsepower made the Shelby Cobra <a href="https://cobraexperience.tapkat.org/win289fiacobra?promo=FIA1">an instant classic</a>. Originals are rare and expensive, so many fans turn to replicas to make their dreams come true.</p>

<p>This is a limited edition <a href="https://cobraexperience.tapkat.org/win289fiacobra?promo=FIA1">50th Anniversary Shelby 289 FIA Cobra Roadster</a>, one of just 50 built.

<p>Painted metallic Viking Blue with a yellow nose stripe, <a href="https://cobraexperience.tapkat.org/win289fiacobra?promo=FIA1">this striking Cobra</a> has a race-ready look. This Cobra has the power to back up its racy appearance.</p>

<p>Under the hood, you'll find a Ford Windsor V8, which started life as a 302 but has been bored and stroked to 363 cubic inches. It breathes through a set of four Weber carburetors, and other modifications include a hydraulic roller camshaft and aluminum heads.</p>
<p>After the modifications, the engine produces an incredible <a href="https://cobraexperience.tapkat.org/win289fiacobra?promo=FIA1">500-horsepower</a> and 450 lb/ft of torque. That prodigious power is sent through a Tremec five-speed manual transmission.</p>
