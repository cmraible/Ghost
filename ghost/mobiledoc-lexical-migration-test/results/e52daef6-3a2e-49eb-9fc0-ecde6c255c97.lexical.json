After sitting on display, and fending off any kind of driving time, unfavorable conditions, and keeping that clock low, the person who sold recently it had bought it in 2002 from the dealer’s showroom. From there, he moved it into a climate controlled showroom for storage. So in essence, this is likely the closest any of us will get to seeing a ‘brand new’ GNX, in 2019 - and that was worth an astonishing $200,000 to one bidder, who now gets to take the car home.",
