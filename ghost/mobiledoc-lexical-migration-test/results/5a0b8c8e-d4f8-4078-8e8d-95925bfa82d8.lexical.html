<p>By now you no doubt have heard of the famous <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">Lost Corvettes</a>. Essentially left to rot in New York City, these 36 Corvettes have been rescued, restored, and now are being given away in a massive drawing. Proceeds from the effort will go towards veterans charities, so everyone who enters can feel good about supporting a worthy cause while also having a shot at a ‘Vette. There’s still <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">time to enter</a> or to buy even more tickets if you have already. Plus, as a Motorious reader you can get double the tickets by using our <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">promo code TLC57</a> or clicking <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">here</a>.</p>

<p>Already, 10 cars have been given away to <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">lucky entrants</a> who are everyday people like you. In an official ceremony held recently in Times Square, model years 1954, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1972, 1975, 1979, 1986, and 1988 were handed over to their lucky new owners. The winners didn’t know which car would be theirs until it was announced right there, so the tears of joy at the event were real.</p>

<p>One of the winners, Thomas Barnes of Brick, New Jersey, happens to be a veteran of the Army National Guard during the Vietnam War. Barnes won the 1975 Corvette, but it’s not his first ‘Vette. He’s been a fan since the 1980s and has owned several since then, but he was still excited to be part of this amazing contest as a <a href="https://www.corvetteheroes.com/?promo=TLC57">winner</a>.</p>
