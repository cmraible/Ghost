Most likely it will feature the same 649cc 2-cylinder engine as the Z650, which is paired with a 6-speed transmission. Everything else mechanical should be unchanged, with the exception of a slightly shorter wheelbase, likely because of a different fork and/or suspension. In other words, this isn’t a complete rethinking of the bike but rather a reskinning for those who prefer a retro look instead of the more aggressive, modern vibe. Expect the overall dimensions to be larger with the retro packaging, including wider handlebars."
