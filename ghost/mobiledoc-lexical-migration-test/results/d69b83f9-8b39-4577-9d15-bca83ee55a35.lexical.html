<p>While many people in <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/australians-get-c8-corvette/">Australia</a> are getting tear gassed for going to the beach or staying at the grocery store for too long, the Khalil father-son duo are out there committing some real crimes. Simon Khalil, 53, and his 24-year-old son Brendon Khalil are two of five people in a group renting out stolen luxury and high-performance cars to notorious Sydney <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/crime-syndicate-targeted/">crime figures</a>.</p>
<p>"They were effectively operating like a hire car company purely for profit," said Detective Superintendent Grant Taylor.</p>
<p>The two men are a part of a larger network that supplies stolen high-end cars to crime families known in Australia, like feuding Hamzy and Alameddine, in case our Aussie friends are familiar with the names. At least nine of the luxury and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/camaro-zl1-1le/">high-performance cars</a> involved have been sized, some of them were even modified at a Summer Hill shop.</p>
<p>"They were getting extraordinarily dark tinting on the cars and also the cloning of number plates that replicated legitimate number plates somewhere in Sydney," Mr Taylor said.</p>
<p>Their defense has presented that the men were just helping in the shop, where many cars were serviced. Just like in America, itâ€™ll be up to prosecution in this case to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they were involved. Three others were charged alongside the father and son, and one was in possession of a weapon used in a shooting in 2020.</p>
