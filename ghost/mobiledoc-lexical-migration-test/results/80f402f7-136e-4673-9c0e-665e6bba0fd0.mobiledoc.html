<p>On Wednesday 2/16 at 7:00 pm ET (4:00 pm PT),<em> Daily Poster </em>paying subscribers will chat with Donald Cohen, author of <em><a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/privatization-of-everything">The Privatization of Everything: How the Plunder of Public Goods Transformed America and How We Can Fight Back</a>.</em></p>
<p>Cohen founded the In the Public Interest, a nonprofit research and policy center dedicated to shared prosperity and the common good. In his new book, co-authored by Allen Mikaelian, Cohen chronicles longtime efforts to turn public goods into private profit centers, and offers up a road map for how citizens can reverse the trend.</p>

<p><strong><em>Like all our live chats, the event is exclusively for </em>Daily Poster<em> paying subscribers, who will be able to watch the broadcast live, ask questions in real time, and watch a replay of the event. </em></strong></p>
