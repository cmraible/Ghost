<p>There are many fans of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/biggest-impala-barn-find/">1960 Chevrolet Impala</a> and it’s easy to see why. Just like this convertible we found for sale on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/ebay-1969-chevy-camaro-z-28/">eBay</a>, they’re large and dramatic, with plenty of chrome, those rocket taillights, and some of the coolest fins ever put on an automobile. Not everyone is into such a classic <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ship-carrying-luxury-cars/">land yacht</a>, but there’s enough of a following to make them pretty desirable. This one is particularly wonderful, so we’re curious if any of you might want to take a shot at it.</p>

<p>Right up front, we want everyone to know this beautiful ’60 Impala <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/used-car-pricing-insanity-update/">isn’t exactly cheap</a>. The seller, who says they’ve had it for 2 years, is asking a cool $105,000 for the Buy It Now price. Of course, you can also make the guy an offer if you think that isn’t fair, so maybe you can get it for a more competitive amount.</p>

<p>We think with the red paint plus white trim, sparkling chrome, whitewall tires, and that two-tone red and white interior, this Impala convertible is absolutely gorgeous. The seller claims it was in a large collection for “many years” but we’re not sure if that’s why it looks so impeccable or if the current owner did all this work.</p>

<p>The seller does state that this is a rust-free California car, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wildest-rust-wrapped-cars/">which is a huge plus</a>. He also claims it not only runs, it runs great, having never left him stranded. Exactly how much he’s driven it isn’t clear. Under the hood is a numbers-matching Tri-Power 348ci V8, which apparently runs perfectly. That’s paired up to an automatic transmission for smooth cruising.</p>

<p>You’ll note all the original details in the photos. The seller says there’s a 45-inch record player and tissue box included in this Chevy. However, a Bluetooth audio deck has also been installed, in case you don’t have any vinyl to play while cruising around.</p>
