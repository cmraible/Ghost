<hr>
<p>Attention classic car collectors who can get to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-restoration-supreme-court/">Iowa</a> this Saturday: a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/neil-peart-classic-car-collection-heads-to-auction/">large group of vehicles</a> will be auctioned off in Williams. The Hemken Classic Collection was amassed by Daryl Hemken over the course of decades. Now, all the amazing American and European <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-dealer-no-contest/">classic cars</a> will be going to new homes, and it’s for a good cause.</p>
<blockquote><em>Iowa was the site of a classic car restoration Supreme Court decision. Read about it <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-restoration-supreme-court/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to Steve Hemken, his dad started the collection in the 1960s when he purchased a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ford-model-t-snowmobiles/">1914 Ford Model T</a>. Bit by the bug, the man just <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/massive-classic-car-collection/">couldn’t have enough cool old cars</a>, so he started gobbling them up rapidly throughout the 60s and 70s.</p>

<p>The collection is quite large, with between 65 and 70 cars set to cross the auction block at the Hemken Farm in Williams, Iowa. The classics range from pre-war all the way into the 1960s and are from brands such as Ford, Chevrolet, and Rolls-Royce. Many of these cars were kept in a museum, so they’ve been admired by the community.</p>

<p>Daryl passed away back in 2005 and was in the middle of restoring a 1940 Chevrolet. His wife, Ann, finished the restoration for him and as a way to honor her late husband. She passed away just last year. That car understandably carries a lot of emotional value, making it hardest for Steve to part with.</p>

<p>Most of the money raised through the sale of the cars will go to endow a scholarship fund for the McPherson College in Kansas. If you’re not already aware, it’s the only college in the United States which offers a 4-year degree program for car restoration. So in that way, the Hemkens will be helping to fuel the next generation’s passion and involvement in the classic car industry.</p>
<p>If you want to bid, you’ll have to attend the auction in person or bid online through Rich Penn Auctions.
