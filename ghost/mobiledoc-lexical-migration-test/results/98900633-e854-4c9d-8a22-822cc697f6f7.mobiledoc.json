We’ve seen all kinds of Frankenstein vehicles like this one, both good and bad, but this Lucky Gunner 1976 Hemi Bug definitely sits on the good side of the spectrum. It’s crazy yet highly functional, because in the end looks do matter but performance is most important."

Not only would the Bug’s factory chassis not even begin to withstand the torque exerted by the Hemi V8, there’s probably nothing in those dimensions which would. That highly custom element helps to ensure you won’t see a bunch of copycat cars all over the place."
