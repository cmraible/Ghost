Already, The Smallest Cog team has been laboring to restore a few of Hammond’s cars, which will be on display at the show. If you follow the man on YouTube, you have been getting some updates, but this will be a chance for those who can make it to London to see the cars in the flesh. One of those cars is indeed the Jaguar XK150. Adding to the excitement is the announcement that a surprise will be on display, possibly a guest."
