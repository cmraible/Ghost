<hr>
<p>Photos leaked from the set of the new <em>The Flash</em> movie show Batman’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-batmobile-uncloaked/">new ride</a> when he’s not cruising around in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/batmobile-history/">Batmobile</a>, and it’s a Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 concept. If you’re thinking this ride looks familiar, it’s probably because you remember when it was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/pebble-beach-wants-memories/">unveiled at Pebble Beach</a> back in 2017.</p>

<p>Also in the pictures is Michael Keaton, who apparently is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/worst-batmobile-yet/">playing Bruce Wayne in his later years</a> of serving as the Dark Knight. Some people consider Keaton to be the only true Batman and have similar feelings for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/batmobile-abandoned-in-field/">Tim Burton Batmobile</a>, which we’re unsure will make an appearance in some form during the film.</p>

<p>When Daimler revealed swoopy, dramatic Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 concept it was featured both as a soft top convertible and a hardtop coupe. Bruce Wayne apparently owns the hardtop variant, even though it has never been offered to the public. But let’s be honest, when you’re producing a movie about a guy who can run fast enough to travel through time and another guy who dresses up like a bat to fight crime at night, you can <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/fast-furious-car-death-toll/">bend the rules of what’s available to consumers</a> in the car market.</p>

<p>Daimler said the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 an electric car. That means under that super long hood is space for custom luggage, because there’s not a huge V12 engine occupying all the room. The drive system produces a healthy 750-horsepower, which is definitely needed to get the modern land yacht moving. Considering the concept does 0-60 in under 4 seconds, or so it’s claimed, the thing is definitely quick. We’re sure this car is nothing compared to the next iteration of the Batmobile, which hopefully isn’t some cobbled-together Mopar muscle car which looks more like it belongs in the next <em>Mad Max </em>movie.</p>

<p>You’ll notice the tail end of this Mercedes-Maybach 6 looks more like what you’d see on a luxury yacht, which was intentional. It helps ensure for a dramatic entrance, which is something you’d expect from the aged Caped Crusader. At the very least, <em>The Flash</em> will feature one cool car and maybe more.</p>
