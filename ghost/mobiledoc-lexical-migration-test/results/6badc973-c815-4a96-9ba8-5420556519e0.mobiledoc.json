Production teams or YouTube personalities will locate a car and then work with the owner to stage a scene, making it look like they just happened across it while cruising along or doing something ridiculous. The fact it’s at a shop where one of these guys probably have a friend who’s an employee just makes the whole situation seem even more suspicious, especially since the entrance is gated for obvious reasons. In other words, this is definitely not a chance encounter."

To be fair, at one point while looking at a bunch of classic Chevrolets you see two guys talking in the background, so these guys are hamming it up with the owner of the cars to grease the gears and get information, which is definitely advisable."
