This means more content about real experiences with products and services — not just details about the products/services — so you can make an informed decision when you're ready to buy.\n2. Implementation of a **brand new CMS** (we migrated from WordPress to [Ghost](https://ghost.org)) **and comment system** that empowers you, the audience, to engagement on the site in a positive way.\n3. Become a **destination for entrepreneurial resources** with the launch of the **brand new [Resources section](__GHOST_URL__/resources/)** of the site which will feature a collection of helpful resources ranging from recommended downloads to must-read newsletters and articles to must-listen and watch podcasts and videos. If you have recommendations for resources that you think should be added to the section, [let us know](__GHOST_URL__/contact-us/)!\n4. The launch of our very **own membership product: [BestTechie Plus](__GHOST_URL__/plus/)** which offers access to a number of great perks such as access to our **online courses** (including early access to our course on how to become a highly effective business networker), an **ad-free site experience**, access to our **member-only Discord** to meet and communicate with other people in the community (including myself!), as well as access to member-only **discounts and giveaways**, plus much more. You get all that and more with membership, and did I mention, pricing starts at **only $5/month or $40/year**. It's a steal if you ask me!\n5. We're **relaunching the [TechieBytes podcast](__GHOST_URL__/tag/techiebytes/)** too, starting with two brand new episodes that are being released today. Additionally, we're always looking for new and interesting guests, if you or someone you know would be a good guest on the podcast, please [get in touch](__GHOST_URL__/techiebytes-guest-suggestions/)."

Today, we are launching our brand new community-focused design and content strategy, which includes our new take on reviews, how to's, insights, and analysis. It also means we're launching some new initiatives as well. "

There's a multitude of reasons for this but I think the triggering of it all actually revolves around the shut down of my analytics startup, KYA, back at the end of 2017. It was then that the quality of the content we were publishing started to fade until it was not of the caliber that I had held myself and the team to for so many years prior. I'm here to tell you that's no longer going to be the case. Moving forward, you can expect to see a lot more authenticity in our content. "
