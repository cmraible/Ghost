<p>On Tuesday, the <em>New York Times</em> published a puff piece about how former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, has become “the smiling face of a well-financed effort to defeat a proposed tax increase that is crucial to funding the $3.5 trillion social spending bill at the heart of President Biden’s agenda.” The tax loophole Heitkamp is defending allows wealthy heirs to inherit investment assets without paying any capital gains taxes. The <em>Times </em>quoted Heitkamp saying her new job is “very consistent with my concern about revitalizing the Democratic Party in rural America.”</p>
