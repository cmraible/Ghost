<p>There was a time when we used to show off our digital or cartoon printed watches. That was really a time when we savor moments with things, not technologies. Now, with top-notch, high-end smartphones launching all the time, watches have lost their importance. Wearing simple watches seems like a thing from the past.</p>
<p>But, the watch industry has inverted entirely now. The word “smart” is also suffix of watches. Smartwatches are booming with popularity and are going to stay around in the future as well. Let’s review some <strong>best smartwatches</strong> available in 2016.</p>
<h2>Why Should You Buy A Smartwatch?</h2>
<p>The smartwatch market is relatively new as compared to the smartphones. But, it is following the same trend and direction as the smartphone market created before it. Some people believe that a smartwatch works like a smartphone, however, that’s not correct. There is no comparison between a smartphone and a watch because at the moment, many smartwatches require a smartphone to perform certain tasks and to utilize their complete feature sets. That being said, smartwatches are great for getting access to information in quick glances and making quick responses. Additionally, smartwatches are excellent health companions.</p>
<p>A good way to test a smartwatch for its performance is to figure out its capability as compared to your smartphone. If it handles your tasks well enough like the smartphone, then you can go ahead and buy a smart watch after choosing a style you like. More considerations are important like the battery life, style and color, water resistant power, notifications and cameras.</p>
<p>Have a look at the list and choose the most intriguing smartwatch for yourself;</p>
<h2>Apple Watch</h2>
<p>Apple has made an effort to produce its first smart watch. Similar to other Apple devices, the Apple watch gives too many features and takes a lot of getting used to before you can handle it easily.</p>
<p>The Apple watch will cost you at least $349 for the baseline Sport model or more depending on additional bands and accessories you may want to buy. The company also offers a more expensive Stainless Steel model simply called Apple Watch, and an even more expensive “Edition” model.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch</strong> is an iPhone tailored watch. It relies on the operating system called WatchOS that works in conjunction with your iPhones operating system, iOS.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-43715"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-43715" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1.png" alt="apple-watch-1" width="828" height="465" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1.png 828w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1-300x168.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1-768x431.png 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1-600x337.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1-696x391.png 696w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1-748x420.png 748w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/apple-watch-1-610x343.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></a></p>
<p>It is a convenient and better suited watch for those people who love Apple gadgets and are ready to pay a higher price. The design is stylish and functional, but it does have one drawback which is the battery life, as the Apple Watch lasts only one day on a full charge, meaning you will likely have to charge it nightly.</p>
<p>The watch is well integrated with Apple’s iOS operating system so it seamlessly connects with the iPhone and can perform tasks like calling and texting easily. The Apple Watch also features 8GB of internal memory storage that can be used for native apps or to store music.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, pricing for the Apple Watch is a bit on the higher end, ranging from $349 to $399 for the Sport version, $549 to $1049 for the Apple Watch version, and $10,000 to $17000 for the Apple Watch Edition.</p>
<p>The RAM memory included in this watch is 512 MB. A power graphics card and a sound speaker are built-in. Bluetooth 4.0 fits well in the new watch. The battery is Li-Po 20Mah with 38mm / 42mm dimensions. The watch is also compatible with iOS 8.2.</p>
<p>Free fitness oriented features are very significant from Apple provided in this watch. The watch has been tested for water resistance, the results shows that using it in the water like swimming pools and beach can void its warranty. The damage can be caused by not properly following the Apple guidelines and if kept for longer period, water can damage it.</p>

<p>The watch comes with a built in heart rate sensor. It is capable of receiving notifications. Siri virtual assistant is also available for voice commands.

<p>A lot of talk is going on in New York Times and Wall Street Journal about the Apple Watch lately. The main issue is the battery life which barely lasts one day. People with tattoos and changing skins face difficulty using heart monitoring feature. The monitoring feature cannot record the exact reading of the heart due to skin changes. Despite these little noticeable flaws, the watch has still done exceptionally well in terms of sales.</p>

It does a lot of useful stuff for its users and pulls it completely well. Different user experience reveals that it has some battery problems. But, there have been lot of improvements since the first band has launched.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-43720"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-43720" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1.png" alt="microsoft-band-1" width="702" height="394" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1.png 702w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1-300x168.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1-600x337.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1-696x391.png 696w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/microsoft-band-1-610x342.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></a></p>

<h2>Vector Watch Luna</h2>
<p>Many companies are using different approaches for developing new smart watches. It is indeed good news that Vector Watch Luna is designed with a different style. It has a month-long battery life.</p>
<p>Some users have reported that the apps are poor on this one, but good news is that the overall functionality is improving over time with software updates being released time to time. Some point in the future, it is expected that the watch would be higher in rankings for notifications and battery power.</p>
<p>It has a square face which does not give it a shape of a toy for a 10-year old kid. There are three controls on the body of the watch. It’s not too thick nor is it considered a gigantic smart watch, in fact, it looks like an ordinary wrist watch of 20<sup>th</sup> century. The design looks equally good on both male and female wrists.</p>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-43721"><img class="alignleft wp-image-43721" src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1.png" alt="vector-luna-watch-1" width="650" height="366" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1.png 906w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1-300x169.png 300w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1-768x432.png 768w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1-600x338.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1-696x392.png 696w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1-746x420.png 746w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/wordpress/2016/02/vector-luna-watch-1-610x343.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Due to having no backlight, the display at night can be a challenge to see. Notifications can be modified and tailored according to the preferences. The screen is ordinary and it has no touch feature to it. Local weather widgets are activated in the watch and it can even keep track of the calories you burn.</p>
<p>Despite issues with connectivity between the watch and your smartphone those have been solved with software updates. The most powerful thing is its battery life, which is observed to have a time period of one month. While other smart watches hardly last for ten days, <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/review/wearable-tech/vector-watch-luna-review-uk-3626072/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vector Luna</strong></a> provides extraordinary long battery time. It does not make or receive calls, so if you need a call making and receiving functionality, then this watch is not for you. It tells the time and is a treat for those people who do not want to use their charger for as long as a month’s time.</p>
