          "A family in Casa Grande, Arizona is reeling after the 1948 Chrysler Windsor they’ve owned for over 40 years was damaged during a police chase. The classic car was crashed into by a suspected drug dealer as he was fleeing from police and lost control of his car. Now the family is blaming police in part for the damage."

Eventually, he lost control of the Chrysler 300 he was driving, the car crashing into a residential yard and finally hitting not only the ’48 Chrysler Windsor but also a bedroom."

Police did say they found drugs, a modified rifle, and cash in Castro’s car. He’s been charged with possession of a dangerous drug for sale, transportation of a dangerous drug for sale, possession of a narcotic drug for sale, transportation of a narcotic drug for sale, three counts of misconduct involving weapons, unlawful flight from pursuing vehicles, and felony criminal damage."

Even with exercising caution, your beloved ride might be damaged by someone else who just doesn’t care. We’re hoping the Rodriguez family is able to get their home and Chrysler Windsor fixed soon."
