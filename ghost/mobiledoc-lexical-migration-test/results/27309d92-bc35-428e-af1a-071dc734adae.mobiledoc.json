          "Introduced at the 1972 Montreal International Auto Salon, the 1972 AMC Gremlin Voyageur concept car could very well be the precursor to the modern crossover. This show car featured a sliding rear deck called the \"Grem-Bin\" â€“ a sliding shelf that was able to extend cargo load length by an extra 18 inches. There were even plans to include window curtains to make a sleeping platform long enough to sleep two adults. AMC only built this single Gremlin Voyageur concept car, and it was painted in a unique two-tone exterior with a Baja Bronze interior. Considering the extendable platform offered no protection from the elements, it's no surprise such a concept never came to fruition, but it is a cool little side note in AMC's history."
