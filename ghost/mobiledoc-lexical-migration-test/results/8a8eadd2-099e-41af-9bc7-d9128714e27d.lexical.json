A 5.0-liter V8 provides loads of low-end torque for hitting the trails, plus it lets the boxy SUV charge from 0-60 in a shocking 5.6 seconds. Really, it’s no surprise the UFC man has an affinity for a stocky little brawler like this which can dish out and take a lot. And since this is a limited-run anniversary edition of what some view as the definitive trail machine, this is the type of vehicle which will appreciate in value over time since only 150 were made, especially if it’s well-maintained. But you should know White turned this Defender over to his oldest son when he turned 16, so judge for yourself if that’s a good idea or not. His other son only got a BMW M6, which sadly is a downgrade from what his brother received.",
