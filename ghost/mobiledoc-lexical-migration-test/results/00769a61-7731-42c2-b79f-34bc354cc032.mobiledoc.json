This Hellcat is the very first Sublime Green Hellcat to ever be delivered, this one-of-a-kind Hellcat has also only been driven 69 miles which were put on before delivery. The car comes with many additional factory features including red seat belts, engine block heater, Uconnect radio, and 20 x 9.5-inch Brass Monkey forged SRT wheels adding up to a total MSRP of $62,270. Being the first of its kind to be delivered, the current price sitting at just $7,000 over the original sale price is a steal."
