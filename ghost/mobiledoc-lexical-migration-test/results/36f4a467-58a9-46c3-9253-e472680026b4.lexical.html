<p>A reminder that today at 4pm ET (1pm PT) is our weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a>. This past week, <em>The Lever</em> published <a href="__GHOST_URL__/fear-and-loathing-among-the-union-busters/">its expos√®</a> on the restaurant legal summit, an event held by the legal arm of the notorious National Restaurant Association (sometimes referred to as ‚Äúthe other NRA‚Äù). It may not surprise you to find out that restaurant executives and their lawyers are worried about the uptick in union drives across the country, especially at large chains like Starbucks. </p>
<p>David Sirota will be discussing the summit with Julia Rock, who reported the story. They‚Äôll also be taking questions from the audience LIVE on-air.</p>
