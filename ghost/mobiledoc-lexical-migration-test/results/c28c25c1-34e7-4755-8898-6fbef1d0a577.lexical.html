<p>Vin Diesel not only is an actor with a stage name taken from a fuel but is also a bit of a talker. During the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/new-fast-x-trailer/"><em>Fast X</em></a><em></em>(that’s 10 for those of you who don’t know your Roman numerals) trailer premier, the guy started telling reporters what the plot of the sequel movie will be. I don’t know how serious he was being, but apparently it will involve a self-driving car company CEO as the bad guy.</p>

<p>Automatically, I thought <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/elon-musk-car-collection/">Elon Musk</a> would be a shoe-in. I have mixed feelings about the guy, but he has a great cameo in Iron Man 2 plus it’s not like he’s running multiple companies, so he’s wide open for filming. All joking aside, I think, Vin Diesel says he’d really like to see Robert Downey Jr. in the role.</p>

<p>That’s right, the guy who played Iron Man for years and years would be the big bad in Fast and Furious 11. Before you laugh I think it could happen. After all, they’ve been able to land some pretty big-ticket actors for the last few installments, meaning they’re slinging some serious cash or they have access to some pretty serious blackmail.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. is in the process of promoting his upcoming <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/robert-downey-car-collection/">Disney+ “real life” show</a> nobody will see. It’s all about him having a public struggle session about his sin of owning a lot of gas-burning cars, then having some green energy experts convert them to be greener, then giving his entire car collection away. To save the planet. And for relevance.</p>

<p>So in other words, starring in a Fast and Furious movie would be a great fit, especially as the villain. I hear there’s a Swedish teenager who would be a great sidekick villain as she shames Dominic Toretto and the rest of the Corona family for driving instead of using a solar sailboat.</p>
<p>And people wonder why I was done with the Fast and Furious movies years and years ago. But plenty of people will consume the current product and get excited to consume next product, whether Robert Downey Jr. is in it or not.</p>
