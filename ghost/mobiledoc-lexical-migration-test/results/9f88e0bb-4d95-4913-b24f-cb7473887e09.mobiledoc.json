After all, everything was getting the black-on-black-on-black-on-black (etc.) treatment to the point it was just ridiculous. Some cars look really good with that, like this 1967 Chevy Camaro Pro-Touring build. Now that we’re out of the era of everything being murdered out, we can really appreciate the look. But this build can more than back up that sinister appearance, making it even more compelling."

Even though “LSX” is stamped into the intake, it’s not an LSX, something Dennis says throws people off all the time. This mill is pushing a monstrous 800-horsepower, so it’s not a pushover in the least. Making use of a dry sump that’s ideal for autocross, the guy wants to compete with this beast once he has everything sorted. In other words, the man not only built the car himself, he’s not going to make it a garage queen. Incredible."
