        "markdown": "\n#### ** Who are you? **\n\nI’m Adam Tinworth, a digital journalist, blogger and publishing strategist living on the West Sussex coast, and loving it. I’m married, have a delightful young daughter, Hazel, and enjoy a range of things from good whiskies, through writing and photography to gardening.\n\n#### **Are you the guy that used to edit *****Cub *****/ write RPG stuff / go to school in Scotland / fence / be VP: Welfare / run the school darkroom / work on *****Felix* / work at RBI / teach digital journalism****?**\n\nYeah, that’s me.\n\n#### **How long have you been blogging?  \n**\n\nI first started blogging with a [Livejournal](http://adders.livejournal.com/) back in late 2001, in the aftermath of my Dad’s death. I started *One Man & His Blog* in March 2003 because I wanted to try something different from the “group of friends chatting” feel of my Livejournal. I started on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) and then moved to [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) a few months later. If I was starting again, I’d probably go with [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/), but for now, MT suits me just fine.**  \n**\n\n#### ****Why One Man + His Blog?****\n\nIt’s a rather lame pun on an old British TV show called [One Man & His Dog](http://www.isds.org.uk/society/connections.htm), which was essentially televised [sheepdog trials](http://www.workingsheepdog.org/).\n\n#### ****But <bloggerx> uses the name!****\n\n<bloggerx> may well use the name and, last time I checked, there were five different blogs using the name “One Man & His Blog” or some variation thereof. As far as I can establish I was the first blogger using it by a good few months, so I have no intention of giving it up.\n\n#### **Is this blog connected to ****RBI or any of its titles, including *Estates Gazette*****?  \n**\n\nOnly inasmuch as I worked for the company for 15 years, a relationship which concluded at the end of 2011. This is my personal blog, and all the opinions here are expressly my own and should not be construed as being those of any employer or colleagues, or my wife, family or friends. They’re mine. All mine. *My precious*.\n\n#### **So, who’s the blog aimed at? **\n\nHonestly? It used to be just me. I spend my working life writing for a known audience. I write this stuff because I want to, and anyone who reads and likes it is a bonus. Magazines I’ve worked for shift in the region of 28,000 copies a week, so I have no insecurities about reader numbers to prop up. If five people a week get pleasure from this blog, so much the better.\n\nHowever, I’m increasingly conscious that there is an audience out there of people who are interested in the intersection of blogging, technology, digital evolution, content and journalism, and this is very much for them, too.\n\n\n"
