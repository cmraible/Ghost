<hr>
<p>There has been a lot of talk surrounding the now famous <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/">GAA Classic Cars</a> vehicle auction house, their precedence for excellence and high yields for beautiful cars has allowed them to boost to the top of the automotive auction industry in a relatively short amount of time. Years of exponential growth thus far have just afforded them a record-breaking performance at their last two spring auctions, and they have just reported an impressive 91-percent sell-through rate - up even more from last year's July auction.</p>

<blockquote>The July auction featured a No Reserve Collection from the former owner of the Charlotte Hornets, George Shinn. The George Shinn collection consists of a mix of vehicles like a 2013 Porsche 911 Carrera S and a 1970 Mercedes 280SL to several outstanding Ford Galaxies, Bel Airs, and Mustangs.</blockquote>
