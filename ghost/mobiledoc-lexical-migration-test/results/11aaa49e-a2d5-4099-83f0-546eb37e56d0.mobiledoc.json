          " was penned by the legendary automobile designer Marcello Gandini and a total of 2884 copies were produced between 1990-2001. Lamborghini introduced its high-performance, mid-engine Diablo in 1990 and was the first production Lamborghini capable of reaching speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 kilometers per hour). While Marcello Gandini penned the initial design of the Diablo, it was Tom Gale at Chrysler Styling Center who approved the car's final design. However, the Diablo 6.0 VT was penned by Luc Donckerwolke.  During its eleven-year production run, the Diablo was available as a two-door coupe and a roadster with a retractable hardtop. A total of 2884 copies of the Diablo were assembled at the Sant'Agata Bolognese plant in Italy."

It rolls on chrome 18-inch OZ wheels wrapped in Pirelli Assimmetrico tires hardly hide the Brembo disc brakes. It has only 5,916 miles on the odometer and you can own this rare one of only 26 examples."
