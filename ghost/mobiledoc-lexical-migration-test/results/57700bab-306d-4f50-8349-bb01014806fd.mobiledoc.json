People have hacked them up all kinds of different ways, creating everything from ice cream trucks to hot rods, called T-Buckets. And while there have been some pretty hot T-Buckets, most pale in comparison to this one with a twin-turbo LS V8 sitting right up front."

However, the guy “just wanted to do something crazy.” Well, he got just that, because with two sizable turbos and an LS, this thing is incredibly overpowered. The builder said he estimates it’s making 700-800-horsepower."
