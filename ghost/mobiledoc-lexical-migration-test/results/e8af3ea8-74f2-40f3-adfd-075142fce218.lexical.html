<hr>
<p>Starting in 2020 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/more-car-thefts/">car thefts were up</a> in just about every <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/worst-cities-car-thefts/">major city</a> around the world. Blaming the problem on the COVID-19 lockdowns, job losses, people being in an ornery mood, bored kids out of school, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-theft-spike-blamed-stupidity/">high-tech theft techniques</a>, etc. doesn’t solve it. In the UK luxury cars thefts have been particularly vexing as illustrated by an incident involving a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2008-bentley-continental-gt-speed/">Bentley Continental GT</a> stolen from a home in Preston.</p>

<p>According to police, the elderly owner was the victim of a burglary and the keys to the luxury car were stolen. Sadly, it was the second time in 2 weeks the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-steal-chevy-camaro/">residence had been targeted</a>. It’s not entirely clear if the owner took additional security measures or not, but if so they weren’t enough.</p>
<p>Later, the stolen car was spotted by police who signaled for it to pull over. Being a brilliant person who chose a career of crime, the driver decided to try outrunning police. Considering a power, big, all-wheel-drive car probably could easily outrun the pathetic econoboxes British police use, it was an understandable move. However, superior numbers and radios paid off as officers combed the streets and found the Bentley dumped in nearby Fulwood.</p>

<p>No report of the condition of the luxury car was provided, but it sounds like either the theft was done just for joyriding purposes or the criminals realized they needed to dump it before police caught them. It doesn’t sound like the people involved will swear off crime and start living an honest life. Authorities say that in the last 6 months 3 luxury coupes have been stolen from homes in Preston. That might not sound like a lot but considering how valuable the cars are it’s considerable. Plus this is a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-couple-luxury-car-theft/">growing problem in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully all the stolen cars have been recovered so far, but thieves might become savvier with practice. It’s time to do a security check on your home and vehicles, especially if you own a collectable car since thieves can use some crafty ways to target you.</p>
