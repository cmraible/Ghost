According to General Motors, the engine produces a solid 300-horsepower, making this ride worthy of being called “America’s sports car.”"

The 3:73 Positraction differential and a Muncie M-21 four-speed have also been installed. The factory 3-speed manual transmission is also being included in the sale."

One exception is that instead of red vinyl upholstery, the owner had soft Al Knoch red leather installed, making the interior feel far more luxurious. While you see the original controls and AM/FM radio, hidden in the glove box is a modern AM/FM/CD deck which was installed professionally, so it looks great when you open the door."
