You’ll love popping the hood, not only to make everyone wow at all that muscle, but also because several parts like the air cleaner, valve covers, and supercharger are chromed out. A 3-speed automatic transmission and dual chambered mufflers complete the setup."

          "Just a quick inspection makes it obvious this Blazer has been through a complete restoration. The red paint is absolutely like glass, shined to perfection so you could part your hair looking at one of the body panels. There are some nice details on the exterior, like the brushed grille and headlight casings, really setting this apart from other Blazers. Punching things up further are the modern HID headlights, so you don’t struggle to see on a dark road. As you no doubt have noticed, this Chevy has been lowered for better handling, making it more of a street machine than a trail runner. Nice polished wheels and a removable top make this SUV absolutely fantastic to take to any show."

The leather seats have gray and a red that matches the body, which match the doors and dash. The same gray on the seats is applied to the rim of the billet steering wheel and the padded top of the dash, while a slightly different shade of gray graces the carpeting. Billet aluminum on the gauge panel, a front center console with cupholders, and large storage compartment really round out this interior."
