It shares roughly 2/3rds of the components, meaning, these parts can be interchanged with the original Mk II. Both of the cars have the same dimensions, same stamped steel roof design, and come in very close to the same weight. Where they differ is in the Commemorative Edition’s much improved electro-galvanized steel used in the body."
