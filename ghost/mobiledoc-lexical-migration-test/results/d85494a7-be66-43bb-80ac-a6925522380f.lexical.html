<p>Friends:</p>
<p>I’m emailing to tell you about a special offer from our colleagues at <em>Jacobin</em> magazine exclusively for <em>Lever</em> subscribers:</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/subscribe/?code=THELEVER" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">$1 Jacobin Subscriptions</a></div>
<p>We’ve been working with <em>Jacobin </em>magazine (I’m an editor-at-large there!) since the very launch of our project in 2020. <em>Jacobin </em>is published online every day, and you’re probably familiar with their regular democratic-socialist commentary on politics, economics, and culture. But they also publish an impressive quarterly print magazine that funds their important work. <br><br>I not only read every issue of <em>Jacobin</em>, I tell my friends about it. They’re filled with the best design around, articles, lists, infographics, and incredible storytelling that you won’t get in the mainstream media.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jacobin</strong><strong> is pushing progressive ideas where they should go</strong></em> — into the hands of people who want to not just talk about how bad the world is, but who want to actually change things.</p>
<p><strong>It’s important work and we want <em>The Lever </em>subscribers to be able to access it.</strong> You can <a href="https://jacobin.com/subscribe?level=standard-digital&code=THELEVER">follow this link</a> to get a year of <em>Jacobin </em>in print for just $10, or an introductory $1 subscription:</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://jacobin.com/subscribe?level=standard-digital&code=THELEVER" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">$1 Jacobin for The Lever Readers</a></div>
<p>We’ve enjoyed working with <em>Jacobin</em> over the past few years, and I know you’ll enjoy reading it.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
