The Dodge Charger 500 was named for the homologation rule at the time, which was that at least 500 of a car must be sold to the public for it to be considered stock. Only one item got NASCAR riled, the spoiler under the front bumper, although it was allowed because other stock cars used them. Since this car wasn’t rocking anything else too extreme, it was able to slide right into competition."
