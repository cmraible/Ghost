<hr>
<p>In stock form the vehicle that was formerly reserved for military use only was capable of fording waist high water and climbing a 22-inch step. However this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1999-hummer-h1-4/">1999 AM General Hummer H1</a> being offered on Bring a Trailer is far from stock. As a modified open-top example, lifted and riding on 37-inch tires, it is likely way more capable than how it came from the factory. Although, it is <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1999-hummer-h1-4/">now powered</a> by an interesting choice of engines. The 3.9-liter Cummins 4BT turbo diesel inline-four paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and dual-range transfer case seem to be a rather lateral movement from the stock 6.5-liter but may help lighten the beastly SUT up a little. Other features of note are a set of LED spotlights, heated seats, a Momo steering wheel, a rearview camera, and a custom audio system.</p>

<p>Further adding to the uniqueness of this <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1999-hummer-h1-4/">H1 Hummer</a>, only 252 open-top models <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1999-hummer-h1-4/">were made in 1999</a> and only 12 were finished in this shade of Silver Metallic paint. Included in the sale are a set of service records, some spare parts, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Tennessee title.</p>
