The previous owner added some very nice mods to this Skyline GT-R V-Spec II, enhancing its looks and performance. Among them is that prominent East Bear carbon-fiber hood, white Volk TE37 Wheels, Bridgestone Potenza tires, N1 front bumper/rear trunk lip, Ganador mirrors, Greddy Coilovers, and front tension arms. Under the hood are HKS intakes, HKS EVC, MAF delete, Nismo N1 twin turbos, ARC front-mount intercooler, aluminum radiator, air oil separator, and an oil filter relocation kit.
