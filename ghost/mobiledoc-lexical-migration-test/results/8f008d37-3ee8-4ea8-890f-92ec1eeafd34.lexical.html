<p>Each <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Porsche/356">Porsche 356</a> has a story, and Porsche finds certain joy in tracking down the tales of some of its old models to understand what happens to its produce once it leaves the factory.</p>
<p>The latest model to have its history revisited is a 356 B with a 75-horsepower 1600-S engine, and a long history on the sunny coast of California. Its route to America started in 1961, when the ivory-coloured car was was loaded up from Zuffenhausen and sent to San Francisco to the Porsche Car Pacific garage.</p>

<p>It spent several months there before being sold to an owner who lived in the city’s suburbs, an area well suited for storing and driving such a vehicle. But its Californian adventures at that time are lost to history, bar frequent maintenance, and all was known that the engine was replaced with a slightly older unit and the fittings became a little worn over time.</p>
<p>Stephan Wilms, of VAG restoration and upgrading business ‘Das Triebwerk’, spotted the car in 2014 while it was under the possession of a importer who had taken the car from California back to its homeland of Germany.</p>

<p>“It was kind of love at first sight”, is Stephan’s recollection of meeting the car, comparing it to a much loved piece of furniture.</p>
<p>The aged car was likely in need of restoration at the time, a task given to Dirk Patschkowski, but the decision was made to retain the various marks and details that were proof of the car’s long existence, citing a patina attitude. Having the car in less than perfect condition was a marker of authenticity to anybody who saw it thereon.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the only rust on the car was limited to an improperly cranked jack, which had dented a sill panel. A bit of welding and what they thought would turn out to be a big job turned out to be a relatively small one. Their minds then switched to the paintwork, which proved to be a non-issue to colour match and therefore only required minor detailing rather than a full repainting job.</p>
<p>The original blue and yellow ‘rally stripes’ remained, with an element of graininess that makes the car look like it’s existing in-period on camera as well as it does in person. The underbody and engine compartment did get ice-blasted, while the underside of the bonnet was finished in satin black.</p>

<p>In essence, this is a car that should work just as well as any other well looked after classic Porsche on the road - thanks to a 12-volt electrical system, disc brakes and attuned suspension - but retains the looks of a classic that has only aged with pride.</p>
