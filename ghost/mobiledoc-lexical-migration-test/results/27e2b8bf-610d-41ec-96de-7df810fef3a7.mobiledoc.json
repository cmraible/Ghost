Meanwhile, Stellantis says Dodge Challenger sales for Q1 of this year totaled 11,371, up slightly from the 11,124 sold in Q1 of last year. But that wasn’t enough to edge out the Mustang. Insert the sad trombone music here."

That said, the Dodge Charger still absolutely creamed the Mustang in sales with 22,128 sold for Q1 2023, a 43% jump from the 15,439 sold in Q1 2022. Perhaps this is why it’s rumored Ford is working on a Mustang sedan? And here we’ve been told repeatedly the sedan is “dead” and people only want crossovers."

Does this mean the fascination with the all-electric mommy mobile is waning? Perhaps, but it will be interesting to see how it fares the rest of this year."
