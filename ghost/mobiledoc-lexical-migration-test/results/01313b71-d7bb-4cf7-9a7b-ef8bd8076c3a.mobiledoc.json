That turn of the market has shocked many since just a year ago trucks were king, leading bloated sales prices which more often than not punched well above MSRP. My how the turn tables."

While the Detroit Three try keeping dealer inventories lower than they were in 2019, this market downturn is throwing a monkey wrench in that scheme. For anyone who can afford to buy a new truck in the coming months, they will have far more negotiating power than during the height of covid policy mania, ironically in part because of government action taking in the pandemic."
