<hr>
<p>Most people dream of buying some shiny, new car straight off the dealer lot with just a few miles on the odometer and zero problems with anything. We’re not exactly normal people, and while a brand-new car sure sounds nice in a way, we also dream of rescuing <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/barn-find-pontiac-trans-ams/">neglected classics</a> and restoring them. If you’re that kind of person, these barn find <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/brief-history-of-the-now-classic-corvair/">Chevrolet Corvairs</a> listed for sale <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/facebook-find-1983-ford-mustang-fox-body-safari/">on Facebook</a> could be right up your alley.</p>

<p>Not everyone is a Corvair person, so we get it. The reputation of the car really took a hit thanks to Ralph Nader’s book <em>Unsafe at Any Speed</em> and for many it never recovered. There’s also the fact that Corvairs aren’t <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-corvair-with-c8-engine/">muscle cars with a beefy V8</a>. However, they were innovative for their time, being the first American vehicle to sport a rear-engine, air-cooled, rear-wheel-drive layout. In other words, people pretty much love or hate them.</p>

<p>According to the listing and accompanying photos there are 4 Chevrolet Corvairs for sale and each one is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/look-on-in-horror-at-these-12-valuable-barn-find-cars/">definitely in barn-find condition</a>. They’re dusty, have a nice thick patina showing, apparently have sat in this barn near Carthage, North Carolina for the past 20-plus years. We don’t know from the listing if anyone has tried to start them up, but we’ll take a shot in the dark and say no considering the asking prices and the fact that wasn’t included in the listing.</p>

<p>One of the cars is a 1963 Chevrolet Corvair Spyder, which the listing says is “intact but (the) floorboards are rusted out). The asking price for it is $2,800.</p>
<p>Also for sale are two 1965 Chevrolet Corvairs and a 1966 Chevrolet Corvair. The owner is looking for $1,000 for each of these three cars. The guy who put up the listing says his friend Lesley owns the cars and has the titles for each one. He’s apparently a good Samaritan who wants to keep these classics out of the junkyard.</p>
<p>For that kind of money would you grab any or all of these Corvairs? Check out the listing for yourself.</p>
