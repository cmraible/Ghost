<p>Completion of the work at NCM Motorsports Park is scheduled for early 2024. The track will remain open while improvements are made. Currently offered to the public is the C8 Corvette driving experiences, track rentals, and go-kart racing.</p>
<p>National Corvette Museum President and CEO Sharon Brawner shared her thoughts on the plans. “The National Corvette Museum, along with our board of directors, looked at the extent of the damage to the Motorsports Park and decided to find the silver lining in a really difficult circumstance. The improvements we have planned will take our already world-class racing facility to the next level, including much-needed indoor and outdoor event spaces, bar and restaurant offerings in our track observation areas, and upgraded garage facilities.”</p>
