<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbInJlc3RvbW9kIl19">Restomods</a> are done a lot of different ways, some better than others. This <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/2040-tpa/1950-chevrolet-3100-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">1950 Chevrolet 3100 Restomod</a> is one of the better ones we’ve seen in a while. There’s a smooth, coherent design outside and in, combined with some serious performance chops. In fact, this truck is a little too tempting, so hopefully someone buys it soon.</p>

<p>The first thing everyone sees is the two-tone paint, which just hits you like a ton of bricks. Not everyone will be a fan, but the matte black below and high-gloss purple with a metallic flake up above is striking. If you look closely, there’s a white pinstripe separating the two colors. This overall dark scheme makes the white wheels and what brightwork is left on the grille, bumpers, and such really pop. Shaved door handles keep everyone’s attention on that smooth body.</p>
<p>Looking fantastic as well is the bed. While the bedsides have been painted matte black to match the lower half of the body, polished slide rails and wood slats with a light stain create a nice contrast.</p>
<p>You get even more contrast with the white interior, which looks more like something you’d find in a modern luxury vehicle. Custom door panels feature buckskin inlays and a branded design. White leather bench seat with individual bolster pads match the vintage <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Chevrolet" rel="nofollow">Chevy</a> sedan white steering wheel and original dash. Even the gauges have white faces, while there are some chrome trim pieces to add more interest. Purple LED accent lighting offers a nice tie to the truck’s exterior. Among the modern features is air conditioning, AM/FM CD deck with USB port, and cupholders in the center console. Then there’s the wild, tall shifter with a piston at the top</p>
<p>Like everywhere else, the engine compartment is super clean and shows tremendously, thanks to plenty of dressed-up bits. Even more importantly, a Chevrolet 350ci V8 crate engine with three dual-barrel Rochester carbs on top puts loads of power on tap. The aluminum radiator and electric fans keep this setup from running too hot, especially when you’re idling. Helping this truck to really sing are ceramic-coated headers and a dual exhaust system. But this truck isn’t just about the power, thanks to a Thorbecke tubular front suspension and four-link setup in the rear. Power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, and an automatic transmission make this truck easier to handle.</p>
<p>There are under 2,500 miles on this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a> since it was built, which explains why it looks so incredibly clean. Whether you want to cruise through town or take this to a show, there’s no doubt this Chevy will impress.
