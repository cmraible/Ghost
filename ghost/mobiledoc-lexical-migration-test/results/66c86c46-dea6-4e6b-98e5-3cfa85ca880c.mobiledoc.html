<p>The <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11817">Chevy Silverado pickup truck</a> is one of the most popular <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/all/1979-lil-red-express-the-first-muscle-truck/">trucks</a> in history. This model has gone from humble workhorse to personal commenting vehicle, and everything in between - and it remains true today. During the late 1970s, the Chevy Silverado started to form a very unique look, and became one of the more popular body styles. Examples like this <a href="https://carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=11817">1979 Chevrolet K10 Silverado</a> are a great representation of that era.</p>
