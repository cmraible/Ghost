          "The Metropolitan is an interesting little car it’s somewhat of a novelty, some might call it kitschy,  and it’s often not taken very seriously. These sub-compact economy cars really stood out during their time when others cars were getting bigger and bigger, and they really stand out against the SUV-cluttered roads today. Another intriguing thing about them as how many celebrities owned one, at some point."

Oddly enough, we can't find the exact one or a picture, strange considering he's one of the most famous car collectors in the world. We did find a news article from 2007 that said it was almost burned in a Malibu fire, but was saved. The car pictures did not belong to Elvis, but it is for sale, "
