<hr>
<p>It is hard to beat a muscle car with a four-barrel carburetor, a 4-speed transmission, and a dual exhaust. While a lot of automakers tried the combination with some success, the greatest to use the setup <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/549/1970-oldsmobile-cutlass-442-w-30?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">turned the performance</a> parts list into a legendary moniker - <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/549/1970-oldsmobile-cutlass-442-w-30?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">4-4-2.</a></p>

<p>Though originally intended to be an optional package for the <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/549/1970-oldsmobile-cutlass-442-w-30?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">Cutlass, the 442 </a>became a separate model in 1968. In 1970, the model hit a peak in performance when GM lifted its restrictions on displacement. </p>

<p>Oldsmobile jumped on the opportunity to drop a super large displacement engine in the 442 and thus the Oldsmobile 455-cid became standard equipment <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/549/1970-oldsmobile-cutlass-442-w-30?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">for the 442</a>. The performance didn’t top out with displacement alone though. For those that wanted the pinnacle of performance, there was the W-30 package. Despite being rated at only five more horsepower than the base model 442, the W-30 package added a special induction system with an aluminum intake, a unique dual scoop hood, a special camshaft, and higher flowing cylinder heads.</p>

<p>With around only 1,500 W-30 optioned <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/549/1970-oldsmobile-cutlass-442-w-30?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">442s produced</a>, finding one today in good condition can be difficult. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/featured-dealer-raleigh-classic-car/">Raleigh Classic Car Auctions</a> is offering this fully restored 1970 Oldsmobile <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-oldsmobile-442-w-30/">Cutlass 442</a> W-30 with less than 2,000 miles added since restored. Independent research has confirmed that this is an original 1970 W-30 with the exception of the front fenders and grill being from 1971. The frame off restoration was completed by Klassic Rides of Denver, NC and over 1,200 photos documenting the restoration are available on their website.</p>

<p>During the restoration, careful attention was paid to the suspension and interior to provide a comfortable driving car without deviating from the original look and feel. In fact, the only time Klassic Rides strayed from Olds’ original design was when they modified the starter motor bracket to help with heat dissipation. Likewise, the Data Plate was carefully followed during restoration and the original engine block, intake manifold, and beautiful gold & black paint matches the original factory production specification. <a href="https://www.raleighclassic.com/vehicles/549/1970-oldsmobile-cutlass-442-w-30?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=april21">This is a great opportunity</a> to get behind the wheel of a rare car in rare condition.</p>
