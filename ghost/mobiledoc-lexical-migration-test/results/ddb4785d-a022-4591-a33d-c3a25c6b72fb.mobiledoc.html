<p>Friends:</p>
<p>This weekend, something amazing happened: We used the national TV airwaves to expose corporate media for raking in fossil fuel money and then downplaying the climate crisis.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1482539718076080133">Watch this MSNBC video clip that’s gone viral</a>. It followed my <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1456686087229689859">previous appearance on CNN</a> in which I spotlighted how the media’s Big Oil and Big Pharma sponsors are gutting climate and health care legislation.</p>

        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">On MSNBC just now, I talked about how corporate media takes big money from fossil fuel advertisers and then refuses to seriously cover the climate crisis. I’m shocked they didn’t cut my mic. Thanks a ton to <a href="https://twitter.com/AymanMSNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AymanMSNBC</a> for the serious discussion.

<p>To be honest, I’m surprised they didn’t cut my microphone, and I know that speaking out like this risks never being invited back on. But I don’t care. These emergencies are so huge that we have to use every opportunity we can to call out the villains.</p>
