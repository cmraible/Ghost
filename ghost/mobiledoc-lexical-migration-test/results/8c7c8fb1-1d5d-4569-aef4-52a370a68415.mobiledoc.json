According to reports, several law enforcement agencies, including the Kokomo Police Department in Indiana began investigating 21-year-old Devon Barr in connection with the theft ring, which specifically targeted Dodge Scat Packs across Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio."

However, they did say an electronic device was a key piece of evidence. They didn’t specify what the device was, but it’s likely for reprogramming the ignitions in Dodges, a tactic many of these well-funded theft rings have been using for years."

Captain Scott Purtee of the Kokomo Police Department told local media his and the other law enforcement agencies weren’t able to identify the other individuals involved in the muscle car theft ring. However, we’re willing to be they’re hot on the trail, so hopefully those people will be identified, arrested, and charged for their crimes."
