<p>We're all facing a lot of problems this year. One problem we wouldn't mind facing is <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form">choosing between a Corvette or a Camaro</a>. That's especially the case when both cars are classics from the 1960s, and both have big blocks under the hood.</p>

<p>The first one we'll talk about is <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/order-form">this beautiful 1966 Corvette coupe</a>. It's finished in Rally Red over black – a classic color combination that's simply stunning. To us, though, the truly breathtaking part of this Corvette is hidden underneath that gorgeous fiberglass body.</p>
