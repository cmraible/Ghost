<p>The second generation was revolutionary <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20712">for the Corvette</a>. It was the first big step away from the original roadster design and it gave America’s sports car many attributes that defined much of the thought process that went into most of the following generations. If you really think about it, what was referred to as the mid-years kind of defined the Corvette into current times. 1963 was the first year for the hidden headlights, a design that hadn’t been used since 1942 and would continue on the Corvette until 2004. Likewise, the first discussion of a mid-mount engine design first came up when laying out the second generation. Ultimately this didn’t happen until 2020 but <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20712">who’s to say that 1963</a> wasn’t the year that the ball started rolling? After all, this was also the first generation designed using a wind tunnel as well, and a huge advantage of putting the engine behind the driver is aerodynamics.</p>

<p>On top of being revolutionary, the mid-year <a href="https://vicariauction.com/auction-house/1/?ahid=20712">Corvettes</a> were also just incredible in style and performance. So much so that from 1963 all the way to 1967, only minimal changes were made to the design with the exception of 1963-1964. Nevertheless, an entire generation's worth of refinements made the 1967 one of the best Corvettes of the second generation.</p>
