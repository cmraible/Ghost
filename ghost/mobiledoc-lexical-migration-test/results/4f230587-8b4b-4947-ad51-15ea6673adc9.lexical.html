<p>The final wraps have been taken off the product, with Finale Speed showing off its carbon-fiber 1970 Dodge Charger during the Barrett-Jackson West Palm Beach event recently. We have to say, the body looks tight and of course is instantly recognizable as one of the most iconic muscle cars ever, Mopar or otherwise.</p>
<p>Finale Speed says it poured 3,500 manhours into creating this body, which helps explain why it looks so good. With an exposed carbon-fiber weave, people will be mesmerized by its appearance and asking plenty of questions. Even better, the construction weighs less than the original Charger body panels and yet it should be quite durable.</p>

<p>For the reveal, Finale Speed’s build makes use of a Hellcrate engine, which is of course a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 with 707-horsepower on tap. Others could go with this option or perhaps the Hellcrate Redeye with 807-hp. There are of course many other choices under the sun, but a body like this should absolutely be backed by some blistering performance.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to get the iconic look of a ’<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-dodge-charger-r-t-looks-factory-fresh/">70 Dodge Charger</a> can buy a full carbon-fiber body through their Dodge Direct Connection dealer. Alternatively, they can contact Finale Speed and purchase it directly from the company. We can’t wait to see what people do with their builds.</p>
<p>Of course, this body will set you back plenty with a rolling chassis starting at $199,000 and a turn-key package costing at least $449,000.</p>
