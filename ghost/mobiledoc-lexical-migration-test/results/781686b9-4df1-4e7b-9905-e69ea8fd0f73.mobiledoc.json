Even better, all of the original fender extensions are still in place giving the Trans Am a factory fresh look. The interior looks just as good, too, with an all-original factory interior colored in bright red and showing no signs of wear. The Trans Am's distinctive gauge cluster bezel is a perfect complement to this interior color, while the tall shifter shows that this car means business."

The listing isn't able to verify if the engine is original to the car, but the VIN shows that this is in fact a true 455 CI car. Showing that this Pontiac is a true driver's car, this big V8 is paired to a four-speed manual gearbox, and the Trans Am even has factory air conditioning that is said to blow cold."
