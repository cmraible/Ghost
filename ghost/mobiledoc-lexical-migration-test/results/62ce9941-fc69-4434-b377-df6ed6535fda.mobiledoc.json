According to reports, the Isabella County Sheriff’s Office says it will be asking deputies to address “whatever calls are acceptable” over the phone as a way to save on gas since it’s about to go over budget."

With about 3.5 months left, 96 percent of the Sheriff’s Office gas budget has been spent. With gas prices hitting record highs almost daily, the paint regular citizens as well as government agencies are experiencing is only going to worsen."

After all, there’s no sign that the almost daily increases will slow down and many worry once it does, costs will be much higher than they are now. Compounding those fears further is talk of a recession and the real estate bubble popping, leaving municipalities and counties with significantly less in property taxes to cover expenses."
