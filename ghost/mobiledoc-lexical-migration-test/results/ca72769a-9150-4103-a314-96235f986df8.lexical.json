            "text": "To provide context in this story, at the time of writing this piece in January 2021, I have just turned 33 years of age, born in January 1988. I grew up in England - just south of London to be precise. I grew up (as did the video game industry) in the 90s and early 00s. To this day, my thumbs are arthritic from all the video gaming I did in my childhood. Every morning, I have to ‘click’ the joints in the middle of my thumbs back into place. However, I can honestly say that it was all worth it (and is more of an issue for future Steve to worry about).",

            "text": "I’ll begin with a whoppingly obvious observation. One of the main differences between video gaming in my childhood and video gaming now is the advent of the internet and, of course, every element of life has been changed or influenced by this in some way or another. People will point out the internet existed in the 90s, and yes it did, but it wasn’t readily available and no ‘normal’ household had any internet access at the time. The other thing to bear in mind when reading this was that back then, the general public was less privy to how and when games were released around the world. Being in Europe, we were in the ‘PAL’ region, and the ‘PAL’ region was often the last place on the face of the earth to see a release of a video game. Sometimes, a game would be released here months or even a year after it had been released in other parts of the world; or with some games, they wouldn’t even be released here at all! This is very different now where most games have a ‘worldwide’ release on the same day. In lieu of the internet, the only way I would get up to speed with video game releases was via magazines. I was an avid buyer of the Official Nintendo Magazine and also Gamesmaster (the magazine not the TV show). More on this later.",

Probably around 1992/1993, we as a family/household had procured a Nintendo Game Boy and a Sega Megadrive (or Sega Genesis to American readers). I can’t remember which one we got first, but I do remember playing them with my older sister Hayley cross-legged on the living room floor (in the case with the Megadrive) or playing with the Game Boy on the sofa or on family holidays. One particular memory was taking the Game Boy on a holiday to north Wales and dropping it at the top of the stairs and seeing it bounce on the solid stone staircase stair-by-stair down to the hall. My sister and I were horrified, however upon rushing to the Game Boy, we discovered it was fine! Just a couple of scratches. The Game Boy is notoriously bullet proof and I can attest to that!",

While the hospital is still there, the car park is now a multi-storey car park, but at the time it was a field of rubble that got taken over by a car boot sale every Sunday.
