<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As the climate crisis intensifies, we all have to do whatever we can to speak out and press our government to take this emergency seriously. To that end, I spoke last week at the Colorado Capitol at a rally pressing lawmakers and our governor to halt fracking and drilling in our state.</p>
<p>Instead of sending out an article today, we thought we’d send along this short video of the speech. I hope you’ll take a moment to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hy6oAERyLM">click here</a> and watch it — and forward it to others who might be interested. (The video has a closed caption option.)</p>
