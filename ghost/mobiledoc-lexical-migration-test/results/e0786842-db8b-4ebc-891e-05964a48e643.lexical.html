<h3 id="holy-guacamole-this-vintage-coupe-looks-clean-and-ready-to-ride">Holy guacamole, this vintage coupe looks clean and ready to ride.</h3>
<p>We typically don’t cover cars that are light on details, but when we saw this incredible Avocado Green on brown <a href="https://www.sunnysideclassics.com/vehicles/325/1972-datsun-240z?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow">1972 Datsun 240Z</a>, we couldn’t resist sharing it with you. While the sale listing on this particular S30 chassis is essentially blank, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/inventory/dealer/Sunnyside+Classics" rel="nofollow">Sunnyside Classics</a> in Ohio have gifted us with an incredible collection of extremely sharp and detailed photos. That means with a bit of knowledge and a careful eye, we can figure out a lot about this car. So go grab your magnifying glass and join us on a detective journey to explore this handsome coupe.</p>

<p>When it comes to classic sports cars, the 240Z has always held a soft spot in our hearts for its combination of low weight and relatively powerful engine. From the photos we can see that this particular <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/1978-datsun-280z" rel="nofollow">Z-Car</a> still carries what is likely the original L24 inline-six. This 2.4L motor makes use of dual carbs and an overhead cam design to pump out a respectable 151 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. While that power doesn’t sound like a lot compared to the big American V8s of the era, it’s important to remember that the 240Z only weighed 2300 pounds. That’s more than 1,200 pounds less than a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbIjE5NzIiLCJjb3J2ZXR0ZSJdfQ==" rel="nofollow">‘72 Corvette</a>.</p>
<p>The Datsun is quite a svelte little machine.</p>
<p>Turning back to the <em>actual</em> car we have listed here for sale, it looks restoration fresh. On further inspection though it seems we are looking at a very well maintained and cared for survivor car. There are several stickers around the engine and body that appear to be original to the car and untampered with. That also means it’s very likely that the posted 78,000 mile odometer reading is also accurate.</p>

<p>The undercarriage is <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/rust-proof-your-classic" rel="nofollow">rust free</a> and the interior look as equally pristine as the body, with the saddle brown leather looking near perfect. If this car is truly a survivor, it might be the most amazing Datsun we’ve ever laid our eyes on. Obviously, anyone looking to purchase this car should do their due diligence and check in with Sunnyside Classics to get the true story of this road warrior, but at first glance this could be an incredible investment.</p>
