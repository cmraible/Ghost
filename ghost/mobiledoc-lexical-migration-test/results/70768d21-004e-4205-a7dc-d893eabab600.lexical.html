<p>In the new episode of our weekly podcast <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota is joined by comedian, actor, and author Russell Brand for a long-form conversation about Russell’s evolution from comedian to political content creator. In the last few years, Russell has built a significant online following, where his brand of anti-establishment, pro-spirituality intellectualism has garnered him more than six million subscribers on YouTube. David asks Russell about his ideological development, as well as some of the criticisms that have been levied against him, including how some of his content could be construed as “conspiracy theories” (11:50). <br></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/0c6992bd/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>In addition, David breaks down <em>The Lever</em>’s recent reporting on the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/billionaire-funded-judges-who-could-decide-his-speech-case/">defamation lawsuit</a> against Beto O’Rourke that could set a dangerous precedent when it comes to criticizing billionaires (4:45).</p>
