          "While the Huayra certainly has a dramatic look which will make even those accustomed to being around European exotics regularly stop and notice, this is not just a machine of beauty. That curvaceous body has been designed to slice through the air, allowing the twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 supplied by Mercedes-AMG to push you forward with extreme ferocity, if you so dare. The 720-horsepower and 738 lb.-ft. of torque are enough to make this hypercar sprint from a standstill to 60 mph in 3 seconds flat while the Inconel titanium exhaust with clustered quad tips wails in some unearthly tone."

          "There’s more to the Pagani Huayra than just extreme performance. It’s a thing of exclusivity, this being the 56th of only 100 bespoke examples crafted by the boutique Italian automaker. While you can see exposed carbon fiber of the body panels, you don’t as easily see the carbo-titanium monocoque which provides the rigidity to rival such power. Computer-controlled flaps each one operating independently and located at the four corners of the vehicle, can provide more downforce, reduced drag, or lessen body roll during cornering as they change positions."

With just under 5,500 miles showing, Chassis 56 would be quite the conquest. It is current on the virtual auction block, so this is the time to cast your bid and follow this lot closely."
