          "A man in Kentucky deviated from his regular routine, the result being a $2 million payday. It used to be when people won a huge sum of money they would shout something about how they wanted to go to Disneyland. However, this guy named Russell Turner has wised up, realizing standing in line after line, paying $10 for a damn hot dog is really not that much fun. Instead, he told the local news he really wants to buy a Hellcat. Russell is our new hero."

Out of pure impulse, he purchased a few more and the instinct paid off big time. Russell lost it when the fourth ticket showed he won the grand prize or $2 million."

Also, his second cousin whom he hasn’t seen since he was in the third grade has reminded him he still owes $10,000 he borrowed a few years ago. People are helpful like that when you win the lottery."

Instead, the man really wants a Mopar muscle car. Although, a Hellcat is going to set the guy back more than if he bought one two years ago. Plus, with the wonderful gas mileage those supercharged Hemi V8s get, he’s going to need to save the rest of his winnings to make sure he can keep filling up the tank (see our picture of real-world Hellcat fuel economy). Anyway, we’re happy for Russell and hope he enjoys his new muscle car."
