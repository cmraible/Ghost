The 1972 Nissan 240Z was purchased in 2001 for a mere $1000, and it had already gone massive changes like the roof being chopped off and the engine swap had begun. It took James sorting some things out of the 240Z to fit the 350 bored out to a 580 in the car. The big engine puts out 300-horsepower, which is a lot for the small-framed 240Z, and it’s backed by a four-speed transmission."
