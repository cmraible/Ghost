<p>Hello, both to my test group, and the first new members. First up - sorry for the silence over the last week. The combination of a busy working week,  some technical housekeeping (see below) and the lingering effects of half term holidays meant that I ran out of time to write things.</p>
<p>That’s something I need to address when I launch the paid section of the site more formally. I need to have a bank of content ready to go, for those days when other paying work has to predominate. Well, until I’m making enough from this site to be able to prioritise it, that is…</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback I’ve had so far. Some key points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The more examples I can give, in posts, the better - it gives things people can cite in discussions or presentations in their own jobs</li>
    <li>I need to explain key terms more — I’m assuming too much knowledge</li>
    <li>I could do that by providing more simple guides, and linking to them</li>
</ul>
<p>One specific and important piece of feedback:</p>
<blockquote>I’d encourage you to more strongly differentiate, to yourself and to your readers, free and paid content. Your free content is very good, and in my opinion, there might be too much of it.</blockquote>
<p>I’m finding this hard, I’ll admit. After 17 years of providing free content here, it’s hard to lock stuff away. But the project will never work unless i do so!</p>
<p>My thinking on this right now is that most of my deep analyses is going to be saved for paying members, and I’ll be adding more basic guides to core issues (like analytics) behind the member wall, too.</p>
<p>Ideally, I’ll like to get to the point where, like Ben Thompson with <a href="https://stratechery.com">Stratechery</a>, i do one in-depth post free a week, and the rest are only for paying members. The pure aggregation “link” posts will remain free for everyone.</p>
<p>Will that be enough? What do you think?</p>
<h3 id="future-topics">Future topics</h3>
<p>Here’s what I’ve got in the hopper for the next couple of weeks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Naming and shaming bad community members: good or bad?</li>
    <li>How much tracking is too much tracking?</li>
    <li>Getting started with a newsletter</li>
    <li>Ways to grow newsletters</li>
    <li>How to convince upper management that they are focused on what was successful 3 years ago, not necessarily what works today</li>
    <li>How to convince them that what works in the business world at large doesn’t necessarily work in our niche;</li>
    <li>More detailed primers, including analytics and SEO</li>
</ul>
<p>Got any more suggestions?</p>
<h2 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping</h2>
<p>I’ve been making some changes behind the scenes on this blog. Here’s what’s been done:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I’ve upgraded the theme on the site to support the latest features in Ghost, especially around membership management. The <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/member-account-page/">membership management page has been improved</a>, and now uses <a href="https://en.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> for user icons.</li>
    <li>Disqus has been replaced with <a href="https://commento.io">Comment.io</a>. Disqus sold out to an ad tech company, and is now so loaded with ad-tracking that I’m uncomfortable using it, and it was adversely affecting load times</li>
    <li>I’ve replaced Google Analytics with <a href="https://usefathom.com">Fathom analytics</a>. Again, it’s about tracking and privacy. I don’t <em>need</em> everything Google Analytics gives me, and Fathom gives me a more useful dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>After 17 years, it feels good to be putting the pieces in place to make the blog a more substantial part of my working life. Thanks for helping me make this work.</p>
