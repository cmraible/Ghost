After being stripped down to essentially bare metal, every part of this was meticulously inspected for wear and damage. All of the salvageable original features were refurbished with the replaceable bits coming from other Porsche performance models. The engine was an exceptionally concentrated piece of this automotive puzzle. It received a Dougherty Racing DC40 camshaft, PMO 40mm carburetors, and an Electromotive DFI ignition which modified engine timing to allow for a lot more power flowing through those Mahle cylinders. All of these performance options are why the vehicle also has a tachometer adapter that enables you to monitor everything directly.",

This treatment was also given to the rea of the vehicle and any other external body panels in need of some TLC. Finally, the interior sports the sort of legendary attention to detail that not even the original could have pulled off with some smooth leather door panels and a set of seats that will drive you mad with glee.
