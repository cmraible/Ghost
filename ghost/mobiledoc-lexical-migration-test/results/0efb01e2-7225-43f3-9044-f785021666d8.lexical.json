Finishing off the performance upgrades, Ford has also improved  engine cooling through redesigned air intakes and larger intercooler as  well as a premium Akrapoviƒç titanium exhaust now standard, which helps  shave nine pounds from the curb weight.",

Ford has also given the  available Gulf Racing livery paint job subtle tweaks with black lines to  separate the colors and a switch from the no. 9 to the no. 6 for the  optional carbon fiber number that can be added to the hood and doors.
