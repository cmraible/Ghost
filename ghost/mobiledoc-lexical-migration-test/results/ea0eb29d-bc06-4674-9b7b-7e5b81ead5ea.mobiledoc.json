In his research, he concludes that humans do not originate from Aegis but from an entirely different planet (or even, a different universe). Countless hours pass by and eventually he and his assistant discover a strange signal emanating from a mysterious galaxy far far away. Milodane and Nevus begin their preparation to visit this strange planet in the hopes of finding signs of intelligent life. However, after arriving, Milo is awoken by a fuzzy little creature called Ridmi and standing in a huge hallway within a gigantic house. The inhabitants are all little creatures called tinykin; clearly something has gone terribly wrong!"

The verticality in each stage makes for some very interesting platforming, truly as though you are a tiny creature in a massive environment. When you begin your adventure, you're standing in a massive hallway in what appears to be a gigantic house. You're definitely not your typical size either; you're as small as an insect. "

However, he is unable to collect them by himself and requires your assistance. But strangely enough, Milo, upon his arrival, has attracted strange colourful little creatures called tinykins, with each having unique abilities. These creatures are drawn to Milo, and Ridmi believes that Milo can use these little creatures to his benefit, collect the lost components and completing his mysterious machine."

Thankfully, dying simply put you back to the last checkpoint before you fell, but if you managed to land safely, it's the trouble of having to climb back up to where you fell off that can become frustrating.
