A two-tone black and silver exterior sure is a head-turner, especially with the brightwork and everything shined up. Some paint correction will be necessary, but it doesn’t look too bad."

Even more impressive is the factory straight 8 is still under the hood, a testament to the durability of the unit. Backing it up is the OE Dynaflow transmission."
