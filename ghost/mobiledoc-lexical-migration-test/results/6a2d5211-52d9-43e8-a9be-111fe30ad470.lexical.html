<p>For the past little while, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bisimotos-all-electric-porsche-911-is-brutal/">Hoonigan</a> has been running a series on its YouTube account called This vs That. The concept is to take two vehicles that are worlds apart and have them compete in an informal drag race. We’ve seen all kinds of weird matchups so far, like a 1<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1966-buick-gasser-toyota-supra/">966 Buick Gasser against a 2020 Toyota Supra</a> and a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-demon-lamborghini-huracan/">Dodge Demon against a supercharged Lamborghini Huracan Performante</a>. This one seems about as uneven as when a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/toyota-corolla-races-camaro/">Toyota Corolla took on a 1967 Chevy Camaro</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-porsche-911-gt3-rs-approach-its-official-top-speed/">Porsche 991 GT3</a> is one of the most potent production Porsches ever. Most supercars would have their hands full going toe to toe with it. You’re forgiven if you give the 1974 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-chevy-c10-restomod/">Chevy C10</a> no chance in this race, even if it does have an LS3 V8 under the hood. There’s only so much a small block can add when faced with a high-strung, ultra-powerful 911.</p>
<p>When you look at these two vehicles on paper it’s a more even matchup than you might expect. While the GT3 makes 420-horsepower from its flat-six engine, that LS3 is pumping a mighty 545-hp, thanks to tuning by Texas Speed. However, the Porsche has a 7-speed PDK, which should trump the 4L80E transmission in the truck. Plus, the 911 GT3 is lighter at 3,100 lbs. vs the hefty 4,640 lbs. for the Chevy. If you’ve raced, you know that just because things look a certain way on paper doesn’t mean that’s how it will pan out on the track.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to take into account the Porsche has lightweight racing seats installed and a roll cage. The Chevy, on the other hand, has coilovers at all four corners and you’ll notice it’s riding low. Plus, there are speed holes created through the oxidization of the body panels.</p>
<p>There’s even more trash talking before this race than the others. It’s a lot of fun, but if you want to see who ends up winning in the video, skip to 5:29 since that’s where the action starts. If you keep watching, there’s a bonus vehicle thrown in just to make things even more interesting.</p>
