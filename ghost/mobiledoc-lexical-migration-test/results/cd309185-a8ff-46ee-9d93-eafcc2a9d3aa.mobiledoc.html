<p>Friends:</p>
<p>When we started TMI, we pledged to do hard-hitting journalism that scrutinized both parties, and this week has proven the success of that vision — and now <a href="#/portal/signup">we really need your help</a>.</p>
<p>In just the past few days, we’ve broken big stories about a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/a-major-wall-street-scandal-just">Wall Street scandal in Mitch McConnell’s Kentucky</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-just-made-a-big-promise-to">Joe Biden making promises to his big donors</a>, Andrew Cuomo <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ny-dems-created-mcconnells-corporate">shielding</a> health care execs during Covid and the Pentagon <a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-pentagon-is-giving-billions-to">subsidizing</a> corporate lawbreakers.</p>
<p>We are having a big impact — and now we are trying to expand. To do that, we need as many free subscribers to pitch in and become supporting subscribers. So here’s the request:</p>
<p><strong>Please go to <a href="#/portal/signup">sirota.substack.com/subscribe</a> and become a monthly or annual supporting subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t love having to ask for support — because I know times are tough out there and I’d rather be doing the work of reporting on corruption. But I also know that corporate- and billionaire-owned media will never consistently scrutinize the power of corporations and billionaires — and so that’s why we are working so hard to build a model of grassroots-funded journalism. It is a model of journalism that doesn’t rely on a few huge donations, but instead relies on many small contributors.</p>
<p>We are having great success — and we can continue building on that success with your help.</p>
<p><strong>Please consider <a href="#/portal/signup">clicking here</a> to become a supporting subscriber — I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for considering this. Onward.</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
