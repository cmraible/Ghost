Similar to past Ferrari Barchetta models, the 550 was only equipped with a rudimentary soft top to be used sparingly in the case of a sudden rain storm. To make this particular 550 Barchetta a little more practical, it comes with a removable carbon fiber hardtop weighing just 20 pounds, which cost $30,000 back when this car was new!"
