          "Salt Lake City Police say that on the night of October 30 a 34-year-old man was taken into custody after he broke into a Ferrari dealership just outside of downtown. Photos released by police show a broken glass door in the showroom and a wheel laying on the floor, seemingly used to bust through the glass. The guy must’ve thought it was the perfect crime, but obviously it wasn’t."

However, while officers were setting up a perimeter around the building and plotting an approach, an employee inside decided to confront the would-be burglar."

Police are remaining tight-lipped about any more information regarding this crime, probably because they don’t want to mess up potential prosecution. It would be nice to see a prosecutor take something like this seriously since car theft, including from dealerships, has been a huge problem for at least two years. The fact this guy was so brazen in throwing a wheel through the glass door, then strolling inside shows just how bad things have become."
