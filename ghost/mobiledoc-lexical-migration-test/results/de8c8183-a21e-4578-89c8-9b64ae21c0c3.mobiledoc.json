Here in North America, it’s perhaps the most affected automaker, having to shut down entire facilities at times to save on its dwindling semiconductor supply. However, the Blue Oval is hardly alone when it comes to deleting some features on vehicles to conserve on chips, so you might be wondering why in Australia Ford is paying out $110,000 to about 100 Ranger owners after it deleted the stop-start systems on trucks."

The Rangers in question are powered by the twin-turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, an engine Ford proudly marketed not only as plenty capable but as one of the most fuel-efficient options. That means a lot of customers flocked to the Ranger to save on fuel costs."

These are designed to shut off the engine instead of letting the vehicle idle at lights, etc. The claim is that without this system installed, fuel consumption increased 8.1 percent. That’s supposed to be about $247 AUD extra in diesel each year."
