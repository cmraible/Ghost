<p>With all the attention the C8.R is getting it is easy to assume that it is the first <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-c8-corvette/">mid-engine Corvette</a> to compete in an American racing competition, but that is simply not so. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/cadillac-xlr-turnaround-sports-car/">General Motors</a> teamed up with Lola Cars International in the early 1980s to build a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/features/360879/2020-mid-engine-corvette-c8">mid-engine Corvette</a> race car. The first two chassis options of the commonly overlooked Corvette GTP was delivered to GM in 1984. </p>

<p>The first chassis featured a 3.4-liter turbocharged V6, while the second used a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ls-powered-vehicles-on-motorious/">Chevy 5.7-liter</a> V8 that produced 800 naturally aspirated horsepower. Chevrolet continued to add more Corvette GTPs to the track through 1988 but chose to cancel their funding for the project despite moderate success in the IMSA Camel GT Series. However, Peerless Racing and Eagle Performance tried to keep the GTP on the track in the 1989 season but failed. Although the Corvette GTP proved to be a formidable opponent on the track, it is easy to understand why they are easily overlooked in the conversation about mid-engine Corvettes. After all the GTP stood for Grand Touring Prototype and were never actually made available to the public. Likewise, it is highly unlikely that one of these race cars ever set tire on a public street.</p>
