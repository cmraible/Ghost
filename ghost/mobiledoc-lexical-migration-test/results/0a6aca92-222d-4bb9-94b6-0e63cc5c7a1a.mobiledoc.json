Others would get a second job, sell some items, eliminate needless spending, or something of that nature. One woman in North Carolina decided the better idea was to steal her own Camaro, then have the insurance company pay off the loan."

However, she’s hardly the first person to think up such an idea, so investigators were able to sniff out the truth."

However, the gears of justice might turn slowly at times, but eventually when they do make their way around they can be crushing."
