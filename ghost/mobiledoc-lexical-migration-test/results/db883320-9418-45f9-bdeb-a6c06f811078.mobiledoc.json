In this case, it looks like the organizational memory of Ford is hell-bent on going against what enthusiasts want while catering to more elitist tastes, taking us all into territory disastrous for future performance."

This has come through many different movements, like the introduction of the EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine, the stripping away of special models like the Shelby GT350, and the audacity of slapping the Mustang name on a electric crossover. While there has been outcry at some of these developments, the outrage hasn’t been as loud as before. Many enthusiasts have been placated since there’s still the Mustang GT with a Coyote V8 available, but that security might not always be around."

Yes, at least the EcoBoost is still a rear-wheel-drive machine, but that might not always be the case. The other argument for the EcoBoost is it makes 310-horsepower. Yes, it does, but you can also buy a Toyota Camry with 301-horsepower on tap. It’s not an impressive figure by today’s standards. Just like the Probe, the Mustang EcoBoost is a laughably slow car compared to other modern performance machines, plus it has an exhaust note which reminds us more of a tuned Honda than a Ford."

You can debate all day long if that’s possible or not, but there are plenty of indications the EcoBoost Mustangs don’t succeed, especially when it comes to providing a true muscle car experience."

Yet it concerns me that Ford might be trying to work up to getting rid of V8s completely. The company has been oddly focused on domination in the European market where ever-stringent emissions and fuel economy standards could spell the death of the V8. Hopefully that doesn’t happen, but the threat seems all too real."

If you think for one moment there aren’t forces inside the Blue Oval that would love to ditch everything muscle car about the Mustang because it thinks that would lead to more international sales, you’re kidding yourself. There are real reasons why Mopar has been overtaking Ford’s little pony in the North American market and it’s not all brand loyalty. Instead of Ford trying to tell consumers what kind of car they want and need, it would do much better to yet again listen to the people and give them what they demand."
