<p>Actor <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/need-for-speed-dominic-cooper-stolen-cars/">Dominic Cooper’s</a> 1978 Ferrari Dino 308 GT4 was <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/wildest-stolen-car-stories/">stolen</a> from right outside his house in North London on February 19. The celebrity took to NextDoor to ask his neighbors to keep their eyes peeled for the car and to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-luxury-car-theft-spree/">beware of increasing burglaries in the area</a>. With car theft on the rise pretty much everywhere, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/rarest-and-most-expensive-cars-ever/">rare classic cars</a> and modern performance machines are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/uk-couple-luxury-car-theft/">particularly attractive targets</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of being targeted, Cooper has had 4 cars stolen in the past year. The other 3 were a Jaguar F-Pace, Range Rover, and classic Austin-Healey. The star reportedly is concerned he’s being targeted, which seems like a reasonable assumption he should have made after the second car was stolen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Dino 308 GT4 was his prized possession. Cooper showed off the red Ferrari in a splashy photoshoot for a magazine in 2019 right after he purchased it, so everyone knows about it. Thieves who go after such rare vehicles are often meticulous and patient, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/car-thieves-using-wildlife-cameras/">employing all kinds of clever methods</a> to learn the habits and routines of their intended victims before striking.</p>
<p>The Irish Sun quoted “a source close to” Dominic as saying the actor is beginning to wonder if having cool cars is worth the hassle of people trying to steal them. This unnamed person went on to elaborate that Dominic isn’t concerned about the money per se but instead really loved the cars, so the thefts are more personal. Of course, unnamed sources aren’t always super reliable, plus the man could have said some of this in duress and not entirely meant it, so take it all with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>We do know Dominic is a gearhead, a fact he disclosed during an interview while the man was promoting the movie Need For Speed. He disclosed that even as a young child he had an affinity for Ferraris, so having the one he finally owned stolen is likely quite the blow.</p>
