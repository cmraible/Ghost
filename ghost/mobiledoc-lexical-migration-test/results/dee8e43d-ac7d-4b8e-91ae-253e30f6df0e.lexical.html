<hr>
<p>These days, enjoying your sports car on the open road <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sammy-hagar-i-cant-drive-55/">can be quite the challenge</a>, especially if you’re in a big metro area. It seems like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/shmee-ford-gt-road-trip/">the roads are constantly clogged</a> with people in Hyundai Elantras going 50 in a 75 mph, camping out in the left lane, and in general ruining the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/need-to-drive-your-classic-cars/">driving experience</a> for those who really love to drive. That’s where the Marsien comes in as “the ultimate adventure sports car.”</p>
<blockquote><em>Don't forget, people use Porsche Cayennes for off-roading. Check it out <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-cayenne-off-roader/"><em>here</em></a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>That’s right, this is a sports car that was made to be driven off the road. We can tell it definitely was inspired by the old Safari 911s as it has a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/porsche-cayenne-off-roader/">heavy Porsche influence</a>. Sure, you’re not going to use the Marsien to go rock crawling, just like how you wouldn’t use a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-raptor-with-tracks/">Ford Raptor</a> for that job. Where this thing shines is in going fast on sand dunes, fire roads, etc.</p>

<p>Created by Marc Phillip Gemballa GmbH (not associated with Gemballa GmbH) the new automaker is really making a splash with its first vehicle. Phillip believes the horsepower war, which has been raging for some time, is officially over. Considering how many supercars and hypercars pushing 4-digit horsepower ratings, that’s a fair argument to make. His solution is to create something different and stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>A production Safari-style supercar certainly is unique. There are aftermarket tuners who produce such vehicles using classics, but consumers virtually never have been able to buy such a thing straight from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Phillip thinks this marks the end of aftermarket tuning. We tend to disagree, but his Marsien is an interesting supercar nonetheless. As you can easily tell, it’s made using a Porsche 992 Turbo S which has been tuned by RUF (that’s quite the contradiction for someone who thinks tuning is over, but whatever). The result is 750-hp and about 686 lb.-ft. of torque. Those are hardly earth-shattering figures, but I guess this is the result of believing the horsepower wars are officially over?</p>

<p>The concept of an off-road supercar certainly isn’t new, but having a manufacturer, even a boutique one, produce such a thing is pretty novel. Will this start a trend with the larger brands like Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc.? Considering they’re already making crossovers, you just never know.</p>
<p>If you want a chance to pilot the Marsien on off-road adventures, this sports car isn’t going to be common at all, so you better hurry. A mere 40 will be made and we bet they’re going to go quick.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_oW-b4-lsQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
