Not only did the guy create such a masterpiece, he decided to take it for a real mudding adventure instead of just driving it on some mild hills or across the creek on a friend’s farm. That takes some guts because if you go off-roading hard enough, you’re definitely going to break something, especially on a build like this."

If you don’t know, you’re thinking that sounds idiotic. When you’re powering through deep ruts and hitting bumps in the trail, you’ll hop around in your seat like some sort of rabbit. That’s one of the reasons off-roaders have plenty of headroom. A Challenger, on the other hand, doesn’t."

If you don’t know, the park is located in the Dallas Ft. Worth metropolitan sprawl, allowing people who normally would have to drive far away a much closer option for getting their Jeep or whatever rig they have nice and dirty. It sounds like a nice place to check out, so if you live in the area you might want to look into it."
