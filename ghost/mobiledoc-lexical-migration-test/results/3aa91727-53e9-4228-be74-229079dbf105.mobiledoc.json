He had 450-odd vehicles in garages upon garages, with about 50 to 60 going on auction come 4 December. What's great is that many of the vehicles have been recommissioned by us and are reasonably good running conditions. Some of the cars have not been seen by public eyes, and only a few people have had the privilege of seeing uncle Louis' collection in the flesh. The auctioned cars will end up on the road. By bringing these unique vehicles to the market, it is a great tribute to Uncle Louis."
