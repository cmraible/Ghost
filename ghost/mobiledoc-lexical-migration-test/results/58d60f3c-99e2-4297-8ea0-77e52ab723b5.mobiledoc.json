That company was called Buick and they made a name for themselves by selling high horsepower muscle cars that were also comfortable and luxurious for the time. Two notable examples from these automakers are the Chevy Chevelle SS and the "

Despite having a bigger engine with more torque, the Buick suffered a defeat with the Chevelle taking the number one spot for the fastest of the two. Despite being very similar cars, it is clear that the extra horsepower gave the Chevelle a clear advantage over the GS400. A few things that can be said about both of the cars though is that they are both extremely consistent and beautiful representations of one of the most beloved eras in automotive history and it was a real treat getting to see these two go head to head."
