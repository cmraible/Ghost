For use as a daily driver, on hunting excursions, and long road trips, each part was carefully chosen to serve a purpose and these parts add utility and value while protecting and preserving David's truck. With 45,000 miles on his rig, David has plans to install a lift kit followed by a new set of Silverado wheels and tires.
