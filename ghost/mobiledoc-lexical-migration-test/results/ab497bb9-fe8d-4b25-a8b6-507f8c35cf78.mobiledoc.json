From Mopar muscle cars to high-performance Ferraris, this collection is also know for power and performance. Instead of packing his collection with as many cars as he could find, Todhunter's collection of cars is based on rare models and trends of desirability in the car collector world. Some of the highlights of the Todhunter collection are set to cross the auction block at Mecumâ€™s Glendale, Arizona, auction this March 18-20."
