Allen  corrected me, explaining it was actually a Corvette steering wheel. What  threw me off was how he used a random Volvo badge on the center hub,  and amazingly it fit so perfectly the whole thing looked OEM. Being  taller, and the doors staying locked while the car was on the floor, I  didn’t see at first the headliner was the same yellow and black tartan  as the trunk liner, a memorable retro touch inspired by old air-cooled  Porsche 911s, explained Allen with glee.
