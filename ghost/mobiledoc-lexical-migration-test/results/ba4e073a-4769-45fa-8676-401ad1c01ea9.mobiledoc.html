<p>At its 25th anniversary gala on Saturday, October 5, 2019, the Petersen Automotive Museum will auction off one of the last public allocations for a new Ford GT. Because <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImZvcmQiLCJndCJdfQ==">the Ford GT</a> is one of the rarest supercars of the modern era with only 1,350 allocations total, this auction represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the winning bidder to obtain the car in any trim—from the ultra-limited-edition (and sold out) Heritage Edition or Carbon Series to custom bespoke paint options chosen by the buyer themselves.</p>
<p>All gala proceeds including the entire sale price of the allocation will directly benefit the Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation—a non-profit 501(c)(3) charity which provides essential STEAM-based education and programs to more than 100,000 children and teens each year. This support also extends to the preservation of the museum’s collection of over 300 vehicles, production of new exhibits, and funding of buses for more than 10,000 title-one students.</p>

<p>Titled “Celebrating Silver, Going for Gold,” the Petersen’s 25th-anniversary gala will honor <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbImZvcmQiXX0=">Ford Motor Company</a> and the Ford Family. Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, will accept the honor on behalf of the Ford Family. The gala will feature food by the famed Drago brothers as well as live entertainment.</p>
<p>“As our biggest fundraiser of the year, the evening promises to be an exciting night for all,” said Petersen Automotive Museum Executive Director Terry L. Karges. “We’re grateful for Ford’s contribution to this year’s gala. The winning bidder will enjoy this extremely rare opportunity as well as make a significant impact on our community.”</p>
<p>Bidding will take place between 8:30 and 8:45 p.m. All specifications will be made available for the winning bidder, who may choose between the 2020, ’21 or ’22 model year. The car will be delivered in the corresponding model year. The allocation is solely for the winning bidder and may not be transferred. Winning bidder must meet eligibility requirements determined by Ford, at its sole and absolute discretion, to obtain the Ford GT allocation.</p>
<p>RM Sotheby’s will be facilitating the charity sale of the Ford GT allocation. Bidding options will be live onsite, via telephone or absentee and the auction will be subject to the standard RM Sotheby’s terms and conditions as well as buyer’s premium, which will be donated back to the Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation.</p>
