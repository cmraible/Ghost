Lloyd can walk up walls and each level contains a way to change your perspective in order to solve the various puzzles within. For example, there’s one level that takes place in a four way intersection with a central point that allows you to rotate the entire level 90 degrees horizontally in order to gain access to the various parts of the puzzle. Each level has unique ways in which the world shifts around Lloyd, which makes for an incredibly stimulating time."

          "is largely non-existent as far as dialogue and character are concerned but the framing device of nightmares plays an interesting role in how the gameplay is presented. Each level takes place in the dreams of the protagonist Lloyd and dreams are often used in storytelling as a presentation of a character’s fears, insecurities and emotional turmoil. That being said, I'm concerned for Lloyd. It's easy to ignore when you're in the middle of a level, each of which feels disconnected from all the others, but in the same between levels, you walk around Lloyd's lonely home before returning to a terror-ridden sleep. Lloyd appears to lead a very uneventful life and in the vulnerability of his dreams, we see the emptiness, fear and even manic delusions about the self that Lloyd experiences. The story might be all subtext, but it paints a tragic picture of Lloyd that gets whispered to you as you play. "

          ": noir colour schemes, similar character models and an absence of music that’s coupled with exaggerated environmental creaks and groans accentuating the creepiness perfectly. The lack of music reinforces the emptiness I mentioned earlier and makes each noise and enemy encounter jarring – you don't expect sound so when it happens, it can be scary in itself. The normal buffer that music provides makes its absence loud – "

If you enjoyed the original release, the extra levels should provide enough reason to revisit this title, but this game feels like it was supposed to be on the Switch. The gameplay is best taken in short bursts and the small screen really helps to accentuate the levels claustrophobia. This game is one of the best puzzle games I’ve ever played and is certainly the best puzzle/horror game I’ve ever played. Most horror games rely on jump scares and copious amounts of gore to keep players on edge but "
