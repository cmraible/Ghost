<p>What is audience engagement and why do we care?</p>
<p>At some level, we've always know — as an industry — that engaging with our audience is vital. However, it's easy to drift away from that insight. As the internet has completely changed the dynamics of our business models and our distribution strategies, we're all seeking new ways of attract, retaining and monetising audiences. </p>
<p>But let's not forget that we've know the basics for decades. </p>
<p>As a child of the 70s, for example, I was a member of the Dennis the Menace fan club from the <em>Beano</em> and UNIT via <em>Doctor Who Weekly</em>. These were both ways of making the audience feel more engaged with the title, and it worked on me. The connection with the magazine was illusory and one-way — but it was enough to make me feel included. And thus, I kept buying (or, more accuratly, pestering my parents to buy it for me…)</p>
<h2 id="a-potted-history-of-digital-audience-engagement">A potted history of digital audience engagement</h2>
<p>From early on in the digital revolution news organisations have investigated the possibility of building closer relationship with their audience through the web. In the 2000s they were often called "<a href="__GHOST_URL__/2008/06/how_to_be_a_community_editor_i/">community editors</a>" or similar, and built relationships in comment sections, blogs and forums. </p>
<p>That job evolved towards the "social media editor" role in the early- to mid-2010s, as social media became more central to the job. This was the era of many publications shutting down their owned and operated community efforts, and increasingly outsourcing any sense of community to their Pages on Facebook, or their Twitter accounts. </p>
<p>This bubble burst during the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2018/01/facebook-newsfeed-changes/">so-called Facepocalypse</a>, when, in the aftermath of controversy about the influence of the site in the spread of misinformation, it downranked news stories in the feed, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2018/03/littlethings-facebook-algorithm/">driving some publishers out of business</a>. </p>
<p>The era of just pushing links to a Facebook page was clearly over. With it came a growing awareness that merely relying on traffic from algorithmic services was not going to be enough. An audience team needed to be able to move readers from a mediated relationship to an <em>unmediated</em> one - through encouraging them to sign up for owned & operated forms of engagement - from news letters to podcasts. </p>
<p>As a result, today's models are much more more sophisticated than those of only five years ago. They are largely — but not entirely — about using digital tools to address digital's biggest problems: atomisation and attention. </p>
<p><strong>Atomisation</strong> is the internet's tendency to split publications into component parts. The net unit of digital publishing is the story, not the publication. Most people arrive directly at a page, rather than going through a homepage. The consequence of that is that you need to have some form of strategy for acquiring readers for <em>every story you publish. </em></p>
<p><strong>Attention</strong> is the fundamental challenge of all digital publishing: with overwhelming quantities of content available, how the hell to you grab people's attention. </p>
<p>I've explored this subject more throughly here:</p>
