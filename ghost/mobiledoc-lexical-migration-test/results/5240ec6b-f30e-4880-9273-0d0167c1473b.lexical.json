Just as amusing is to see people get themselves into ridiculous pickles. One of the latest features a new Ford Bronco which went over a sand dune and got stuck in the soft stuff on the other side.",

To be fair, the Morrvair, as it’s called, is obviously heavily modified, a purpose-built machine driven by an incredibly capable man who pilots the Bronco out of the area with true skill. Still, some less mature people would see a metaphor of the rivalry between the Blue Oval and GM and we just can’t stop them from doing that.",

Earlier in the video as he’s going to rescue a stuck pickup truck he says he doesn’t know what brand it is, Chevy, Ford, Dodge, and it doesn’t much matter to him since they all need rescuing. He’s said this before and we have to agree with him despite all the brand warfare which goes on in some enthusiast circles. Yes, it can be fun to jab the “other side” now and then, but we don’t seriously believe one brand is just superior in all ways.",
