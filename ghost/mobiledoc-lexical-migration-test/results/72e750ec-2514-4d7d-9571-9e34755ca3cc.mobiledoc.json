Whether they love or hate your car makes no difference, you built this car to stand out and to please you, not anybody else. Perhaps you enjoy the look of a stanced Monte Carlo on static suspension, or maybe you’re into the Hydraulic setup community. Either way, you thoroughly enjoy every aspect of the vehicle you worked so hard to build. But how does one go about making their own lowrider? What should you do if you want to develop what is known in the lowrider community as a hopper?"

To increase stability, functionality, and reliability, you need to reinforce elements where this guy comes into play with his 1963 Chevrolet Impala. In the video, this man single-handedly goes about supporting the wishbone piece of his suspension. Essentially, all of the vehicle’s weight is placed on this part, making it challenging to maintain good condition. Along with adding some hydraulic jumpers, he needs to manufacture his own spring pockets and steel wishbone parts."

          "He first creates some 10 mm discs to fit the new spring pockets with his compass and plasma cutter, which he will use for the rest of the work. After cutting the discs, he welds them into a six-inch pipe and cuts the angle to fit the original dimensions. After all of this, he cuts out some cardboard for the wishbone reinforcement, which will keep the piece from bending. Once the plates are tack-welded on, the builder finishes everything off with an 80-grit sander, and he does the same process for the other wishbones. So there you have it, this is just one step in the lowrider process, but hopefully, it will help any aspiring builder looking to build their piece of car culture."
