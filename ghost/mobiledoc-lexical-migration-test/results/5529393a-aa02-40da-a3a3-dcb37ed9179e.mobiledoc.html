<hr>
<p>To keep a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a> original or not: that is the question. Enthusiasts and collectors have fought over the relevance and even the morality of <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/articles/news/398295/modern-hemi-power-moves-this-1972-challenger-restomod/">restomods</a> for some time, but the fight seems far from over. Still, as <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-is-what-a-cheap-lamborghini-costs-to-fix/">Tyler Hoover</a> points out, it appears the tide is turning toward the pro-restomod crowd. The man just bought a 1966 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbInNoZWxieSIsImd0MzUwIl19">Shelby GT350</a> restomod, what he calls his absolute dream car, and it surely will enrage purists.</p>
<p>Before anyone gets too angry, Hoover admits his car isn’t a true <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles?filter=eyJzZWFyY2hfdmFsdWVzIjpbInNoZWxieSJdfQ==">Shelby</a>. Only about one thousand GT350s were made for 1966 and this isn’t one of them. Instead it’s a tribute vehicle with a more modern powertrain and other things you won’t find in most 60s models. The worst part of all that is Hoover absolutely loves it so much, he recommends everyone get a restomod tribute muscle car.</p>
<p>Then there’s the other elephant in the room: Hoover’s Shelby GT350 tribute doesn’t even have a factory paint color. That green sure looks nice, but it’s from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/pick-your-mopar-wing-car/">Mopar</a>. Actually, that’s a wise move because Mopar has always had some of the best paint options out of any non-luxury brand out there.</p>
<p>Hoover was able to pick up this pristine restomod for about what a new Toyota Camry goes for, which is pretty good. Yes, it’s not a numbers-matching original, but those sell for six figures. The guy he got it form poured about $50,000 into restoring it, even doing the paint himself to help cut down on costs. The results are impressive, to say the least.</p>

<p>Not everyone is going to agree with Hoover’s opinion on restomods. After all, there’s the charm of driving a car to factory spec. You get that pure experience the automaker intended, or at least the one it produced. However, the honest truth is many “factory spec” <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-restored-cars-on-motorious/">restored cars</a> are often in better condition than they were when new, thanks to improved technologies and techniques, not to mention an owner with a keen attention to detail combing over every square inch.</p>
