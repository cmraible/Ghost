Some in the past have tried to conceal the car’s performance with stock-looking designs and keeping the original lighting. However, for the most part, the car’s we’ve seen from channels like Autotopia LA in the past few years are all proud of their mixture of modern and classic and wear it like a badge on their exteriors. This particular vehicle is a great example of what makes these incredible restomods so appealing to the newest generation of car enthusiasts.",

That's because this fully hand-built engine was ripped out of an R/V and made to fit in the engine bay of the Chevelle. It's actually really cool how the owner of this car built the whole powerhouse himself nearly 20 years ago out of scratch, something you hardly see anymore. These days, the engine uses 383 cubic inches of displacement, a thoroughly cleaned block, and a touch of forced induction to produce about 650 horsepower.",
