<hr>
<p>Entering into its fourth generation, the <a href="https://www.grautogallery.com/vehicles/10469/1993-chevrolet-corvette-zr-1">Corvette</a> of the 1990s was responsible for putting the American car on par with some of the world’s best super cars and at the top of the lineup was the revered <a href="https://www.grautogallery.com/vehicles/10469/1993-chevrolet-corvette-zr-1">ZR-1</a>. To the tune of $31,683.00, the high performance package included a heavy duty braking system, a selective ride and handling package, low tire pressure warning, electronic air conditioning, specific side body panels, 17 x 9.5 front and 17 x 11 rear styled aluminum wheels, and an upgraded interior. At the heart of the ZR-1 is the 405-horsepower LT5 V8 engine mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. Chevrolet’s goal was to turn the Corvette into the fastest production car ever and the ZR-1 was the means. <br></p>

<p>Although the ZR-1 was available from 1990-1995, not many were actually made. In fact, a total of only 6,939 examples were produced over the six year period. In 1993 just 448 <a href="https://www.grautogallery.com/vehicles/10469/1993-chevrolet-corvette-zr-1">ZR-1 Corvettes</a> were produced and only 240 of them were 40th Anniversary Edition cars. The 40th Anniversary Package consisted of a deep and glossy Ruby Red exterior finish over a matching Ruby Red interior with leather adjustable sport seats. So as you can imagine a Corvette with both of these highly desirable packages is sure to be regarded as a true Corvette masterpiece. </p>
