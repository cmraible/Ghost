<hr>
<p>What a diverse market the collector car industry represents. Every week, the Motorious editorial staff does a dive into the classified section of the site to find the cars for sale that we would want to buy for ourselves. These cars are more than worthy of a new garage, and we're thrilled to be able to share our picks with the readers each week. Here is a list of cars to check out as we roll into the first weekend of spring.</p>

<p>In stock form the vehicle that was formerly reserved for military use only was capable of fording waist high water and climbing a 22-inch step. However this 1999 AM General Hummer H1 being offered on Bring a Trailer is far from stock. As a modified open-top example, lifted and riding on 37-inch tires, it is likely way more capable than how it came from the factory. Although, it is now powered by an interesting choice of engines. The 3.9-liter Cummins 4BT turbo diesel inline-four paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and dual-range transfer case seem to be a rather lateral movement from the stock 6.5-liter but may help lighten the beastly SUT up a little. Other features of note are a set of LED spotlights, heated seats, a Momo steering wheel, a rearview camera, and a custom audio system.</p>

<p>When you look at the other American cars being produced around the same time, it is clear that the Viper was definitely ahead of its time. Additionally, the first examples were put together in record time as well. Exactly two years from the start date, one of the per-production models piloted by Carroll Shelby kicked off and kept pace for the 1991 Indianapolis 500. Later that year, Dodge provided car reviewers and media access to the car and began delivering per-ordered cars first thing in 1992.</p>

<p>In 2018, Dodge released the Demon, immediately breaking a multitude of production car records. It was the first ever production car to be built with the capabilities that it has and to use the technology that it does. The secret behind the Demon is more than just an 840-horsepower supercharged engine.</p>

<p>The Fox Body Mustang carried the model into the future with an ability to be whatever kind of car the driver wanted it to be. At the heart, it was a stylish, comfortable car that was both efficient and quick but with a little modification it could be made into a drag car, used for autocross, or turned into the ultimate weekend warrior. Throughout the third generation, Ford continued to improve on this winning design and in 1993 the generation peaked.</p>

<p>In a fight for the title of the best selling car throughout the muscle car era, the Ford Mustangs styling peaked in 1969. At the same time, sales dropped below 300,000 units for the first time in four years which signaled trouble was ahead for the pony car. With the thought that maybe the styling was just too much, Ford scaled back on the aggressive look for the Mustang but the trend was unwavered and sales continued to drop. This paired with an overabundance of options made this model year a highly collectible one.</p>

<p>It is completely possible that this truck started off as or at some point later on became a work truck but it sure doesn’t look like it. As it sits, this 4x4 is an unrestored true survivor in excellent condition inside and out. Being garage kept since new has kept the paint and bright-work shiny and clear and the underside free from rust. The truck's single owner has managed to only put 98,000 miles on the clock while keeping up with all of the needed maintenance.</p>

<p>The car meets of the late 1990s and early 2000s were filled with what would become the beginning of the move towards the next muscle car era. Lots filled with Camaro’s, Mustangs, and the great late Firebird’s were the norm and rarely did anyone show up in anything different. An Occasional classic would show up every now and then showing the American car community at least a little bit of diversity but one of the most unique sightings came in the form of a truck.</p>

<p>In 1932, Ford became the first American automaker to put a V8 engine in an affordably priced car, a concept they had nearly perfected for the time by 1934. Although by today’s standards, the engines were severely under-powered, at the time the 1934 Ford V8 Coupe was the fastest thing on the road. The car’s natural ability, affordability, and ease to modify quickly caught the attention of car enthusiasts which led to it becoming one of the <a href="https://awesomejoeauctions.com/auctions/3851849-1934-Ford-3-Window-">most popular cars</a> in the Hot Rod community.</p>
