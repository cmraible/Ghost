<p>Good things are happening, especially in the world of accountability journalism! The criminal justice news outlet <em>The Appeal</em> is back as a worker-led nonprofit, and they’re already breaking big stories on the issues shaping the criminal legal system. <em>The Verge</em> is taking a stand on dubious sourcing demands. And our comrades at <em>Jacobin</em> are developing a <em>Class War</em> board game, the perfect gift this holiday season for budding socialists young and old.</p>
<p>All that and much more in this week’s Weekend Reader, exclusively for paying subscribers below.</p><!--members-only-->

<p>• <a href="https://theappeal.org/the-appeal-is-back/"><strong>The Appeal Is Back</strong></a> (The Appeal) —<em> In June, after management at </em>The Appeal tried to shut the publication<em>, the staff vowed to save the criminal justice news outlet. Last month, <a href="https://theappeal.org/the-appeal-is-back/"><em>the team announced</em></a>, “We are now well on our way to relaunching as a worker-led nonprofit news outlet dedicated to critical reporting on the criminal legal system. We’ve taken ownership of </em>The Appeal<em>’s intellectual property, including our website, social media, and everything else we need to serve our audience.” Now the operation has published its first stories, including <a href="https://theappeal.org/retail-theft-ben-dugan-cvs-walgreens-shoplifting/"><em>an analysis</em></a> of how retail chains are manufacturing reports of a “shoplifting crisis” to push for tough-on-crime legislation.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>• <a href="https://www.theverge.com/press-room/22772113/the-verge-on-background-policy-update"><em><strong>The Verge</strong><strong> Updates Its Reporting Standards Dealing With “On Background” Requests</strong></em></a><strong></strong>(The Verge) — “<em>[T]he clear pattern is that tech companies have uniformly adopted a strategy of obfuscating information behind background. It’s also easy to see why companies like to abuse background: They can provide their point of view to the media without being accountable for it. Instead, journalists have to act like they magically know things, and readers have to guess who is trustworthy and who is not. This is bad, so we’re going to reset these expectations as loudly as possible. From now on, the default for communications professionals and people speaking to </em>The Verge<em> in an official capacity will be ‘on the record.’ We will still honor some requests to be on background, but at our discretion and only for specific reasons that we can articulate to readers.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jacobin/class-war-the-jacobin-board-game"><strong>Jacobin Magazine Announces New <em>Class War </em>Board Game</strong></a> (Kickstarter) —<em> “Don’t let the political theme fool you — </em>Class War<em> leaves all moralizing at the door. The gameplay is so addictive that even your libertarian uncle won’t be able to resist the world-historic struggle unfolding in the deck of cards before him. And if he looks closer, he just might see, for the very first time, what a socialist perspective on our society’s class antagonisms really looks like.”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/judge-rules-mandates-up-to-texas-schools.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur"><strong>Judge Says Texas’ Ban On Mask Mandates Violates Disabled Students’ Rights</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“Judge Lee Yeakel, who made the ruling in the suit filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, determined that the order from the governor violated the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/"><em>1990 Americans With Disabilities Act</em></a> because it put children with disabilities at risk. The ruling also prohibits Mr. Paxton from enforcing the order by Mr. Abbott, who has repeatedly opposed COVID-related mandates. ‘The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs,” Judge Yeakel said. “Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVIDovid-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital’s intensive-care unit.’”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/11/3/sec-takes-action-restore-shareholder-rights"><strong>SEC Changes Rules to Make It Easier to Bring Shareholder Resolutions Forward</strong></a> (As You Sow) — <em>“Bulletin’s 14 I, J & K were rescinded. These bulletins severely limited meaningful shareholder proposals, including vastly expanding the prohibition on micromanagement in a way that allowed exclusion of shareholder proposals containing almost any specific request, timelines, or action… Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, said: ‘This guidance, which underscores the original purpose of Rule 14a-8 — to allow shareholders to raise and vote on important issues — is timely and necessary. At this time of global upheaval, the stakes couldn’t be higher.’”</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-cvs-doe-withdraw-partnership/"><strong>CVS Withdraws Disability Rights Supreme Court Case After Reaching Agreement With Disability Rights Orgs</strong></a> (CBS) — “<em>The company formally withdrew its complaint Thursday and announced a new partnership to work with four groups, including the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund. ‘We've agreed to pursue policy solutions in collaboration with the disability community to help protect access to affordable health plan programs that apply equally to all members,’ a CVS spokesperson told CBS News. ‘Any further legal proceedings will take place in district court when the case is remanded.’"</em></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/nyregion/zephyr-teachout-attorney-general.html"><strong>Progressive Professor Zephyr Teachout To Run For NY Attorney General</strong></a> (New York Times) — <em>“On a recent morning, after her son was dropped off at day care and before her property law class was set to begin at Fordham, where she has taught for 12 years, Ms. Teachout conveyed her plans. She explained, for example, how she would expand the attorney general’s focus on worker safety, wage theft and issues of climate and environmental justice, making fossil-fuel companies liable for the damage they cause."</em></p>

The interest rate will be capped at 5% over a 20-year term, which will amount to monthly payments of $1,122. That’s a far cry from the hundreds of thousands in loans some drivers long carried as medallion value plummeted amid competition from app-based rideshare services.”</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Members of the <em>Wirecutter </em>union are preparing to walk off the job during Black Friday week over stalled contract negotiations. “Management has slow-walked our bargaining for 2 years, committed an Unfair Labor Practice by refusing to provide info about wages, and offered wage proposals that significantly underpay our staff,” the union posted on Twitter. </p>
<p>The union is now asking readers and supporters to not shop through the product review website, which is owned by The New York Times Company, from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, unless a fair deal is reached. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexF9gphF-L12PwPF_SQUTZ3mI-gr1wKErZZuUk23ccjODt_w/viewform">Here is where you can sign up to find out more information and get updates.</a></p>
