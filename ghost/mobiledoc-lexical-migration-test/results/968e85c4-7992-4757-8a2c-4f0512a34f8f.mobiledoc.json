Those included car scales, different suspension parts, setup tools, battery tools, plus some racing gear. Frankly, we’re shocked they didn’t keep the trailer as well since those are hot theft items these days. To help cover the cost of the loss, Liu has set up a Go Fund Me campaign, which aims to raise $40,000. That’s a lot more than the $20,000 he says he spent on the car, so maybe the tools cost just as much?"
