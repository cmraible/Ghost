<p>Originally built to pay homage to the start time of Sterling Mosses most iconic victory, 7:22 AM, this vehicle is a true racing car for the regular road. Under the hood is a great example of exactly why that made it a very popular dream car for anyone growing up in that time. That is a massive supercharged V8 engine which is capable of producing 640 horsepower and 605 ft/lbs of torque. Unlike a very famous competitor, which is totally not Porsche, this Mercedes is capable of making horsepower and torque along with a sound unlike any other. Of course, the simple powerhouse and automatic transmission isn't the only upside of purchasing this German automobile.</p>

<p>Another feature which you might find particularly exciting is the exterior styling and aerodynamics package which is more than enough to stick the car straight to the ground. On top of that, you also get a smooth silver color that reflects light like a bullet flying through the air straight toward any opponent who may simply underestimate the vehicle. In total, only 150 of these powerful monsters were ever made which makes the cars something to really be admired by enthusiasts across the globe. Of course, that exclusivity comes with a price but you could be one of the select few with the resources to drop jaws and dominate competition on the racing track.</p>
