<p>Fans of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/2018-cadillac-cts-v/">Cadillac CTS-V</a> are pretty diehard, and that’s even more accurate to say of those who love the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/custom-1967-chevrolet-chevelle-wagon/">wagon</a>. Not sold in high numbers, you sometimes have to really hunt to find one of these things, although the reward is something fast with enough cargo space to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1965-ford-auction/">haul whatever you need</a>. It’s the perfect antidote to the crossover craze which has swept the world. But this guy has used that extra space in the rear to add <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/turbocharged-c6-corvette/">a turbocharger of all things</a>, making what is believed to be the first Cadillac CTS-V Wagon to hit 200 mph in the half mile.</p>
<p>That’s right, and it’s not just any snail mounted up. This one is massive, measuring 106 mm, if you can believe that. To accommodate that turbo, the owner has installed a huge outlet in the rear bumper, dwarfing the two exhaust finishers.</p>
<p>If you’re sitting there thinking, “hey, wait, wasn’t the CTS-V <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/supercharged-bullitt-mustang-is-a-beast/">supercharged</a>?” you’d be correct. Specifically, the sedan and wagon have a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 good for 640-horsepower. For most people that’s plenty of get-up-and-go, but if you’re doing half-mile races and want <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevelle-races-nissan-skyline/">to trounce the competition</a>, you need something more. With the two types of forced induction, this Cadillac CTS-V Wagon is pushing a claimed 1700-hp.</p>
<p>Usually, when you add so much extra power you need to swap out the transmission, but this guy is running the factory 6-speed manual. Yes, he’s our hero.</p>
<p>What’s even more amazing is not much has been yanked out of this wagon versus what’s been put in, so it’s still pretty heavy. While the front seats have been swapped out for lightweight racing buckets, the rear seats and seatbelts are still installed for reasons we don’t understand. You can watch in the video how this Caddie smokes cars that are far lighter than it, making them look like slow bricks. Check it out for yourself.</p>
