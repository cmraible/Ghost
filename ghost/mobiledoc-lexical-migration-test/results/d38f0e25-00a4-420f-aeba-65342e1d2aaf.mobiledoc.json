In fact, only four were produced, so people who just love having something that’s incredibly rare are willing to shell out big time."

While it certainly looks far from awful, the thing is obviously a little long in the tooth. Some people find that adds to the charm, but others who are used to a showroom gleam were a little taken aback."

In fact, it’s believed the driveline has never been taken apart since the ‘Cuda was assembled in the factory. That kind of originality is difficult to find these days. And as everyone can now see, collectors will pay big bucks for that combined with celebrity and rarity."
