<p>The Biden administration <a href="__GHOST_URL__/biden-hikes-medicare-prices-and-funnels-profits-to-private-insurers/">recently reaffirmed</a> its decision to enact the highest Medicare premium hikes in history — just before this year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>And as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cuPAcGBSPw">our new video</a> demonstrates, the president is, at the same time, moving forward with a plan to funnel significantly more Medicare money to for-profit insurance companies and further privatize the government insurance program for older Americans and those with disabilities.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cuPAcGBSPw">our new video</a> about the White House’s troubling Medicare scheme — and then <a href="https://twitter.com/LeverNews/status/1536762791545151489">share it on social media</a> and forward this email to friends and family.</p>

<p>We don’t answer to corporations. We’re a reader-supported news outlet — which is why we can produce this video and report stories like <a href="__GHOST_URL__/seniors-medicare-benefits-are-being-privatized-without-consent/">this</a> and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-wall-street-is-taking-over-medicare/">this</a> that corporate interests would rather keep out of public view.</p>
<p>The only way for those in power to do right by all of us is to continue lifting the veil on these kinds of inconvenient truths.
