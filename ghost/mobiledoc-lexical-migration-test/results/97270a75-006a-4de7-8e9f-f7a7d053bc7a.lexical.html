<p>Today, the Ford Mustang is one of the most tunable cars for enthusiasts, and that all started with the Shelby GT350. Introduced shortly after the Mustang's debut in 1964, Carroll Shelby squeezed as much performance and handling out of this car to develop the GT350. The <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/30080/1968-ford-shelby-mustang-gt350?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1968 Shelby GT350</a> you see here has been fully restored, and it will be up for auction next month through <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">GAA Classic Cars</a>.</p>

<p>Formerly part of Rick Hendrick's Heritage Collection, this beautiful example of a 1968 Shelby GT350 has undergone an extensive rotisserie restoration that the listing says was done to concours-level standards. That means everything is factory correct and the car's condition is as good as it was when it rolled off the assembly line on December 8, 1967 right down to the 10-spoke aluminum wheels wrapped in Goodyear Polyglas tires.</p>
<p>Painted in Wimbledon White with a black interior, this Shelby is easy to spot with its distinctive fiberglass hood and horizontal, sequential taillights. While it's easy to transform a Mustang fastback into a Shelby GT350 tribute, rest assured that this example is indeed a legit Shelby. </p>
<p>Under the hood is a 302 cubic-inch Windsor V8 putting out 250 horsepower, and it breathes easier with an aluminum Cobra intake, Holley 650 cfm carburetor and dual exhaust. A four-speed manual sends power to the rear tires through 3.89 gears, while the power steering and power disc brakes ensure this Shelby was born to carve corners.</p>
