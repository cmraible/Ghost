          "Fuselage styling is also incorporated in the front fender gills and rear quarters. The '71 GTX clay mockup from 1968 included the GTX logo in the grill, front tag with Plymouth Exterior Stying, chrome bezels surrounding the tails, and the W23 \"Warrior\" Kelsey Hays Cast road wheels. What started out as the '67 Formula SX Concept with jet fighter-inspired design cues would show in the '71 GTX."

          "This JetX Concept GTX also came to life thanks to Gary and Pam Beinecke to bring John's original vision a reality. It's a car that could have been in production but due to cost, many of the original ideas were dropped. A beauty to behold, it was the cover car of Mopar Action at one point in time."
