That’s not shocking in the least since we know drug addictions absolutely fuel other illegal activity. But this is helping to shed some light on what’s behind the vehicle theft crime wave. After all, some public figures have characterized these criminals as stealing only to feed their starving family or some nonsense."

In some instances they rammed police vehicles and drove over obstacles to flee law enforcement. They’re also accused of running at high speeds, sometimes in oncoming traffic lanes."
