<hr>
<p>In the1960s, Ford had one goal in mind when it came to road and track racing, and that was sending Enzo Ferrari home to Italy with a loss on his belt. Fortunately, this goal was struck entirely out of the park when Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles helped create one of America's most significant Le Man's competitors ever to hit the asphalt. Fortunately, this legendary car was made easily accessible to the general public in 2005 with an MSRP of just $149,995, which was a relatively low price for such an incredibly high-powered, historic supercar like this one. Nowadays, these cars have become icons from the silver screen, and their vast reputation for high-performance Americans made fun. <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308379">This car</a> is the epitome of that style.</p>

<p>Sitting between the axles of this <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308379">2006 Ford GT</a> is a potent 5.4-liter Ford Performance V8 that utilizes a massive supercharger to make 550 horsepower to the rear wheels. A glorious six-speed manual transmission is mated to that incredible powerhouse and helps the car achieve a blistering 220 mph top speed. That extraordinary performance has made these cars an excellent choice for anyone looking into getting their hands on an insanely fast Ford with plenty of style and speed.</p>

<p>While the exterior follows the same stripped-down 1960s race car look, the interior gives the driver an extremely comfortable driving experience. With black leather bucket seats, a futuristic instrument cluster, and retro gauges, this car is the perfect early 2000s grand touring car. Buyers are kicking down the door for the chance to get behind the wheel of this fantastic <a href="https://hendersonauctions.bidwrangler.com/ui/auctions/69696/6308379">Ford race car</a>. That means that, if you want it, you had better hurry to get your opportunity to own this beautiful sleek beast.</p>
