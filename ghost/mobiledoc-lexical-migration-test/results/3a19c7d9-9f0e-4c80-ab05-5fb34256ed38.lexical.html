<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at Infamous Rabbit's <em>Oddventure</em>. The game is slated to release in September 2022 on PC, Mac, Linux and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Here's the overview:</p>
<blockquote>"Imagine if Nietzsche had a child with Alice in Wonderland and their kid was raised on Grimms' Fairy Tales and EarthBound. That's Oddventure."<br><br>Mood Battle System – A moody twist on classic turn-based combat! Yeah, you can make the enemies run away crying or spare them and get a present. Every battle can be ended in different ways. But be aware of the consequences.<br><br>Make Choices – Every decision matters. It’s up to you how the story plays out and which of several endings you receive.<br><br>Explore and Interact – Meet new people. Or dwarfs. Or other creatures. Everyone has something interesting to say. Or at least you can listen to their sobbing.<br><br>Solve Puzzles – Between battles, explore a world filled with cute and weird puzzles full of odd creatures.<br><br>Oddventure is a JRPG about the misadventures of Charlie - a nihilistic and rebellious teenage girl with anger issues and social awkwardness. Charlie searches for her troublesome brother Bonzo and ultimately for a way back home.<br><br>The setting is the Kingdom of Luxia, a land straight from original Grimm Brothers’ fairy tales with a dark, Nietzschean twist. Its ruler, King Godwynn Good, is Charlie's last hope of return.<br><br>It’s up to you how the journey will end. While deciding you’ll discover the truth about Charlie’s past. And truth about herself... or even yourself.</blockquote>
