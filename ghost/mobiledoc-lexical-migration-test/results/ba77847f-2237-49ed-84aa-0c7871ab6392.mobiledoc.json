But he’s been reworking the stainless steel bodies for the past 14 years and has become quite good at it. It all started when he met John DeLorean himself at a car show. Weissensel had some sketches for DeLorean builds he showed the man who liked them. The rest is history."

While that’s a perfectly respectable stance to take, it’s also unimaginative and not much fun. Constantly tuning and tinkering with cars is a legitimate way to express your appreciation for a certain model. But, as they say, to each his own."
