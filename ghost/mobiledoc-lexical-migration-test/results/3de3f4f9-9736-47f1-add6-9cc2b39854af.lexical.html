<hr>
<p>If you haven't been to the Amelia Island auction and Concours in early March, that should be marked on next year's calendar. Held at an oceanside Ritz-Carlton, one might feel as if they're in a world of luxury with high-end cars sitting under swaying palm trees and abundant sunshine. One of the auctions was RM Sotheby's, and they had plenty of classic and exotic cars up for grabs, but one would likely reach deep into those pockets. The <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/am20">RM Sotheby's</a> auction was held from March 6-7, 2020.</p>
<p>A few of the cars that crossed the auction block are listed here. From performance Ferraris to vintage luxury classics, there were no shortage of cars to ogle over no matter what category you prefer. </p>

<p>Hennessey is a well-known performance company that modifies cars to reach their utmost power potential, and a car with the name attached is a force to be reckoned with. The company has been modifying Dodge Vipers since 1993, but the Venom 1000 Twin Turbo was introduced in 2006. This insane <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/am20/amelia-island/lots/r0140-2006-dodge-hennessey-venom-1000-twin-turbo-convertible/852867">2006 Dodge Hennessey Venom 1000 Twin Turbo convertible</a> sold for $84,000.</p>
<p>To say that the car is powerful is an understatement. The Venom 1000 has two large twin turbos that help the V10 reach 0 to 60 seconds in a staggering 2.5 seconds and nab an insane top speed of 255 miles per hour. To help handle the power are upgrades included suspension components and huge brakes. The front is aerodynamic with a menacing front end. In the race to 200 miles per hour, the Venom beat out the Veyron by four whole seconds.</p>

<p>When this modified Hennessey Viper came out it was $225,000, quite the jump from the $87,000 base Viper. Only 24 of these special Vipers were made by Hennessey, and just 6 were convertibles like this example. The outside is finished in Viper Crystal Pearl Grey, and it is in impeccable condition with just 7,700 miles on the odometer. </p>

Giving it a more menacing appearance is the AMG wide-body conversion kit, and it sits on period Monoblock wheels. The interior is just as fancy with leather Recaro seats and burl wood accents.</p>

<p>Plenty of cars crossed the RM Sotheby's auction stage at Amelia Island with some yet to find new homes. Check out the RM Sotheby's page and see if any of them will suit your page. If you can't afford one like most of us, it's still fun to see what kind of eye candy is out there as car enthusiasts. </p>
