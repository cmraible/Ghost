Everything in that previous sentence might be a lot to digest, especially the fact that someone who could buy pretty much any car he wants would be tooling around in a Corvette. For those who are fans of the C8 it’s not really a surprise."

Well, he owns “most of” the island called Lanai – about 98 percent of it – and there are public roads on the island. If he owned the entire island and the roads, police couldn’t patrol and pull anyone over."

In the video, you can hear the officer and Ellison were respectful or even downright friendly. After all, when you’re a billionaire, a traffic citation is cheap. And when you’re speaking with someone who basically owns the place, you’re going to tread lightly."
