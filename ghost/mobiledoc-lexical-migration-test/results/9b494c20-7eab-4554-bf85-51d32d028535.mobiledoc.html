<p>This car, chassis # B9102814, features a light blue metallic body over a dark blue interior. Accentuating that outstanding color combination is seemingly immaculate chrome trim, flaunting the many design flourishes on the exterior, including true wire wheels with knockoffs. A polished steering wheel hub and rich wood rim plus Momo shift knob showcase the excellent design which captivated car shoppers in the early 1960s.</p>

<p>Proving this is truly a driver’s car, under the hood is a 1.6-liter inline-four engine with Webber carbs, which is more than enough to get this lightweight machine scooting in a hurry. The manual transmission just adds to the overall exhilarating experience of driving this classic.</p>

<p>The short story behind these cars is that the body was crafted by Thomas Harrington Coach Builders Ltd. using the Series II Alpine bodies as a basis. A fiberglass fastback roof really makes these cars look sporty and provides the functionality of a coupe. That was added to a chassis made by Sunbeam while performance tuning was done by George Hartwell Ltd. Authorized Rootes Ltd. dealerships sold Sunbeam Harringtons.</p>
