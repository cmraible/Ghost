<hr>
<p>After paying a deposit of over $27,000 a couple in Phoenix, Arizona told <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/arizona-mvd-porsche-356-b/">AZFamily</a> the clone <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche/356%20Speedster">Porsche 356 Speedster</a> they ordered was never delivered after the shop performing the work suddenly closed. It’s the kind of situation we see all too often, and with economic turbulence only increasing, one we’re almost sure to see on the rise in the coming months.</p>

<p>Adding insult to injury, after the original deadline to have the Porsche 356 Speedster built blew past and there was no end result, the shop reached out to the Phoenix couple to ask for the remainder of the balance for the work. They refused to hand over any money, realizing the dream car they were going to gift to their daughter as a birthday present was never going to become a reality.</p>
<p>Vintage Speedsters, the shop which agreed to build the custom car, told AZFamily it’s financially tapped and is planning to file for bankruptcy. That’s the kind of news to turn the blood cold din anyone who’s put a sizable deposit down on work like this.</p>

<p>According to the AZFamily report, several other customers who have suffered a similar fate with the business. However, Maricopa County prosecutors have decided there’s nothing criminal about it, deeming it a civil matter the former customers will have to work through themselves.</p>
<p>While Vintage Speedsters has been around since 1988, a fact proudly declared on the business’ webpage, it’s under new ownership. AZFamily found the former owner says he also got burned by the new guy, so that adds to the number of people out of significant sums of cash.</p>
<p>Where did all the money go? That’s the question a lot of people have. The current owner sent a message to customers waiting for their cars, blaming parts price increases and other factors for the lack of results and the business’ financial problems. But not everyone is buying it.</p>
