<p>Dear goodness, now LinkedIn is looking at a news offer in its subscription product.</p>
<p>I wonder if we're heading towards a concentric circles model of content monetisation: </p>
<ol>
    <li>The inner circle: your direct subscribers</li>
    <li>The middle circle: non-subscribers monetised through aggregators (Apple News, LinkedIn, etc…)</li>
    <li>The outer circle: non-subscribers monetised through advertising.</li>
</ol>

<p>Google News changed significantly a couple of years ago — but close enough to the pandemic that quite a few people failed to notice. This is a <em>really</em> good round-up of the technical implications of that — and how you can maximise your chances of appearing in Google News: </p><!--members-only-->

<h2 id="the-uneasy-relationship-between-the-media-and-wikipedia">The uneasy relationship between the media and Wikipedia</h2>
<p>An interesting and characteristically angry piece from Mic Wright for his (inevitable…) Substack. The core of it is that our newspapers sometimes get very sniffy about Wikipedia and its reliability — especially when Wikipedia brands papers as non-reliable sources. </p>
<p>But, well, people in glass houses…</p>

<p>There's an interesting partner article to be written on this about how Wikipedia's reliance on a very narrow range of mainstream media sources <em>is</em> biasing the site, but not politically. Because the traditional media is somewhat myopic in what it covers — the sports it chooses to write about and those it doesn't, its long-term neglect of computer-gaming, even as it became a huge commercial and cultural force — Wikipedia ends up mirroring its choices. They need to start taking B2B and consumer magazines far more seriously as reliable sources. </p>
<p>And, as a chaser:</p>
