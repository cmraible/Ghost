<p>This <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1996 Grand Sport</a> is especially desirable due to its options. It's one of only 190 convertibles built – most Grand Sports were coupes. <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Of the</a> 1,000 Grand Sports built, 810 were coupes.</p>

<p>Of those 190 convertibles, just 41 featured the desirable <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">red interior and RPO F45 </a>High Performance Suspension option. These dampers offered selective real-time damping. That's pretty heady stuff for 1996.</p>
<p>All Grand Sports were powered by the <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1996-only LT4 engine</a>, a higher-performance variant of the LT1 that offered 330 horsepower and 340 lb/ft of torque. That's an increase of 30 horsepower over and 10 lb/ft over the standard LT1.</p>

<p>Each and every <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Grand Sport</a> was equipped with a ZF six speed manual transmission and a 3.45 rear axle ratio. Car and Driver tested a then-new Grand Sport and managed a zero to 60 time of five seconds flat, with the quarter mile coming in 13.5 seconds at 104 miles per hour.</p>
<p>As a last hurrah for the <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">C4 Corvette</a>, it did its job well. If offered stunning good looks and impressive performance for its day. Today, it's on the cusp of becoming a bona fide classic.</p>

<p>This particular car has covered just 22,000 miles since new. It certainly looks the part, and its <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Russo and Steele</a> for sale listing classifies it as “investment grade.”</p>
<p>The asking price of $49,500 is indeed a lot of money for a C4. However, it should be clear to you that this isn't just any C4 Corvette. Red LT1 coupes are a dime a dozen – but there are very few Grand Sport convertibles, and we doubt many <a href="https://russoandsteele.com/rscas20201996grandsportcorvette/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">present this well</a>, with such desirable options.</p>
