However, the buyer abandoned them at the dock in his country and there they’ve sat for 13 years, accruing all kinds of storage fees. However, someone found out about the cars and paid the fees, taking legal possession of them."

If so, there’s a good chance the batteries are toast and must be replaced before the cars can be driven."

Sure, there are modern collectables which far surpass these in value, but it’s pretty interesting to see how this process is playing out. Will they crack a million before bidding is over?"
