<p>One of the best things to do with a newer <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/obscure-jdm-cars/">Japanese car</a> is add some serious customizations. They’re often reliable and work great as daily drivers, so your commute is far more interesting than if you were to be driving a more conventional vehicle. That’s the story behind this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/this-shop-is-jdm-eye-candy-galore/">Nissan Silvia S14</a> called the Japanese Tourist. It’s a nice build that’s been turning plenty of heads.</p>

<p>To create this car, owner Stanley went to a shop in Sydney, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-holden-car-values-soaring/">Australia</a>called Garage 88. His request was to transform his S14 Silvia into something not only quick and cool-looking, but also comfortable. Instead of just bolting on a body kit and a few powertrain parts, the shop stripped the car down to the chassis, adding many modern customizations.</p>
<p>You’ll note this car is a widebody. If you don’t know, the S14 was sold in a slightly different form in the US as the Nissan 240SX. A company called Rocket Bunny makes wide body kits for this and many other Japanese cars, including one that’s most excellent for the Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing about this Rocket Bunny kit is the reworked front fascia. Among the tweaks are round headlights (with LED halos), a flat bumper, and a drastically different hood. This kit borrows heavily from American muscle cars, especially the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1970-plymouth-superbird-2/">1970 Plymouth</a> ‘Cuda. While that doesn’t sound like it would work, the result is surprisingly clean and fitting.</p>

<p>Around back, this kit adds a nice lip spoiler for dramatic flair, but the factory taillights are preserved. Maybe that’s a little too manic of a look for some people, but with some creativity you could reconfigure things. On the Japanese Tourist there are some aftermarket lights, a change that’s a little more subtle but definitely works.</p>
<p>What do you think of this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a>? Is it too sacrilegious? Are you a JDM fan or do you lean more toward American muscle? Leave a comment below.</p>
