However, this holds the game back with current gaming trends with save points few and far between while being riddled with difficult combat encounters. For someone who doesn’t have a lot of time to spare, this actually resulted in times where I lost my whole day's progress and me dropping the game for a week because of that. Add in my son taking my switch while it was in sleep mode and putting on a different game - you can see where the save feature causes a lot of issues."

It boasts a tactical approach that laid the groundwork for later games ATLUS released as when you hit an enemy’s weakness or critical hit them, the action is considered unused and allows you to use that action again for a total of eight actions in a party of four before it goes to the enemy's turn, where they can do the same to you. However, contrary to the bonus action, you can actually lose actions if you hit an enemy with a damage type that they are resistant to or completely end the turn if they are immune to it. You can also use your turn to talk with opposing demons to recruit them to your party but if it fails, you lose your whole turn and it becomes the opponent's turn."

One of the newest additions to the remake is voice acting to characters which, overall, adds more depth to them, although some performances are a little bit lacklustre and unnatural."
