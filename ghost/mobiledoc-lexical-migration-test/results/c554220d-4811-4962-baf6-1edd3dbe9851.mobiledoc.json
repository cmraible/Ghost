Next, we watch as the campaigns’ comms staff relentlessly preps Buttigieg on how to “connect with people” about the killing. “Try to keep your hands above the podium,” one tells him. They insist on using the grammatically tortured ‘officer-involved shooting.’ In a bizarre inclusion of footage, given the circumstances, one communications guy mocks Bernie’s New York accent."

At the Democratic debate, Buttigieg gets asked about the killing, and answers head-on. Cut to the pundits. Axelrod bestows his approval. Success!"

He and Chasten watch glumly as the South Carolina returns roll in, go up on stage for the last time, and receive the customary phone calls from Joe, Jill Biden, and Obama — all to the cloying deployment of a song, Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day,” that is simply too good for this documentary.
