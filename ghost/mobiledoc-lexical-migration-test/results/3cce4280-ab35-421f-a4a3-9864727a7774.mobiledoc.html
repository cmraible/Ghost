<hr>
<p>Not to over simplify the art of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1932-ford-5-window-hotrod/">hotrod </a>making, but it would seem that the most successful and widely used equation for creating such a custom vehicle goes as follows: combine a small block Chevy engine, Mustang II front end and a nine-inch Ford rear end with a healthy dose of flamed paint, American Racing wheels and a Lokar shifter.</p>
<p>This custom 1987 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/which-chevrolet-truck-would-you-buy-for-under-25k/">Chevrolet</a> S-10 definitely didn't get that memo, yet it's undoubtedly still one <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-hot-rods/">cool hotrod</a>!</p>

<p>Ok, the small block Chevy V8 is there as is the Lokar shifter, but even these are done with unique customization. The 350 cubic-inch V8 engine block is fitted with a matte black ram-air style air cleaner, ribbed valve covers and long-tube headers, but the coolest part of the engine is that the block is painted in dark red to match the color painted on the mag wheels. This secondary color acts perfectly as a subtle accent to the body's burgundy hue.</p>
<p>Like a true hotrod, this S-10 Roadster uses bits and pieces from other cars like the front bumper of an Austin-Healey Sprite, the grille of a '29 Ford and the dash of a '53 Chevy pickup. The front part of the body angles in to expose the matte black frame rails, and the rear-mounted fuel tank sits just above the Chevelle-sourced rear end. The only remnants of any factory body work on this truck are the heavily customized doors and the stamped rear cab panel.</p>
