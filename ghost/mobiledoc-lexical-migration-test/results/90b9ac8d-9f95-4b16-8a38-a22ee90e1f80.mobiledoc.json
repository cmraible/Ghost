We’re sure that’s enough to make the Mopar faithful very upset, and it probably ruffles the feathers of many of Blue Oval afficionado as well. However, we think Kesatie is probably more concerned with speed on the track and not keeping everything in the family, so likely he doesn’t care about all the hate."

After all, the debate over which forced-induction approach is best divides enthusiasts about as much as which brand is superior."

While the crank and block are Mopar original, the pistons, rods, cylinder heads, cam, intake, etc. are all aftermarket. In other words, this is a true build, not just a few bolt-ons for a modest power gain."

He previously had a ProCharged Coyote V8 in his Mustang, but he says the Demon is “ten times more reliable than the Coyote ever was.” He does go on in the video interview we’ve included to clarify that there are Coyotes which are wonderful, but he had real problems with his that he attributed to the ProCharger setup."
