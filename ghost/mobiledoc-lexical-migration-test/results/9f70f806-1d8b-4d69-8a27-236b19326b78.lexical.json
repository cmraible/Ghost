Perhaps the Corvette lost control and overcorrected, maybe neither drivers were paying attention, or maybe she had pulled out in front of the car not realizing how close it was or how fast it was going. Either way, it could’ve been prevented by the Corvette driver having his fun on the track and respecting the rules of the road, something many enthusiasts ignore far too often.",
