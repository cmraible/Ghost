You’ll follow the story of an unique individual called Reid, half-human-half-zombie, as he tries to avoid being captured after being chased by a couple of thugs. This leaves him battered, bruised and for a short time, trapped within the walls of a mysterious city known as the Ark. After a brief escape, our hero stumbles, falls off the city limits and down into a region known as the slums, where zombies stalk the isolated wasteland."

The hunger and thirst meters can be restored by either eating or drinking different consumables which are vital to your survival. Otherwise, there are a few different negative effects that will befall your character if your meters get too low, such as limited movement or blurred vision which can greatly affect your game. So, to make sure you don’t croak, you must attend to each meter regularly by consuming food and fluids which can be found by scavenging the environment or bought from vendors. Your energy gauge at the beginning of the game is your biggest enemy as it can deplete from every action you take and the only way to replenish it is by consuming certain items or returning to your hide-out and sleeping. Depending on how much your hunger and thirst meters are full will depend on how much energy and health you’ll recover each day. And yet by learning new skills and abilities, you’ll be able to stay out longer and consume a lot less. But remember, you’ll need precious SP points that you can earn by killing and collecting anything in the game. SP can be used on multiple skill trees in your inventory, providing you with new abilities, such as reducing your appetite or allowing you to craft new structures, giving you the opportunity to filter water, grow crops and make better meals among other amenities."
