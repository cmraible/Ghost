First we saw the Challenger Shakedown, which is just some cosmetic mods for 1,000 Scat Packs. I mean, these look kind of cool and all, but I was really hoping for some factory performance mods to really send the Charger and Challenger out with a bang."

But this comes standard on Hellcats and has been available for Scat Packs for a few years, so it’s not new equipment. Why is Dodge doing this? The Charger and Challenger should be going out with a mighty roar, not a tepid whimper."
