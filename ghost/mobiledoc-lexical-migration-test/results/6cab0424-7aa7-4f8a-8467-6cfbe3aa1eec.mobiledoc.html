<p>I’m in danger of being a hypocrite. I’m not practising what I preach. I teach audience engagement in all its wild and wonderful forms, and yet, I’ve never really engaged my subscribers fully with the site.</p>
<p>Schoolboy error.</p>

<p>As Mr Jon Ostrower, former RBI colleague, and now publisher of <a href="https://theaircurrent.com"><em>The Air Current</em></a> put it responding to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/09/when-less-journalism-is-more/">one piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Preach. Respect for your reader and their time is the best way to build loyalty.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. If I want to build this little community, I need to put my money where my mouth is. I need to respect my readers and surface their expertise. So, today, things change. You become part of the site (which, uh, might require a name change…).</p>
<p>Welcome to the first member feedback update.</p>
<h2 id="your-feedback-youtube">Your Feedback: YouTube</h2>
<p>My <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2020/09/hey-guys-the-latest-on-youtube-facebook-oversight-and-more/">piece on YouTube</a> picked up some interesting feedback from you lot.</p>
<p>JoLynne Lyon wrote:</p>
<blockquote>Hi,  just a quick note to say YouTube has been written off too quickly by a lot of PR types (perhaps news people too). Facebook Live gets a lot of attention, but YouTube has a long, robust tail and actually earns revenue.</blockquote>
<p>To quote Jon: <em>Preach</em>.</p>
<blockquote>My Trump-loving friends get a lot of their news from YouTube indie producers. And of course there is some really ghastly “informative” and slickly produced misinformation in YouTube.</blockquote>
<p>This has been gnawing at me for the last couple of years. It always rears its head when I prepare the video lecture series I deliver at City. But I’m feeling it more strongly than ever this year. Just today, we’ve been reminded that YouTube has been one of the havens <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517640/youtube-qanon-content-policy-update-hate-harassment-ban-facebook-pinterest">the QAnon movement has been growing</a>.</p>
<p>People get their news from YouTube — but note nough news organisations take it seriously. This is concerning. </p>
<blockquote>I’ve wondered if traditional news providers should launch a channel under a new name, make it look less slick, and sneak in some real sourced reporting to win back the viewers they have lost. But that’s just me. :)</blockquote>
<p>I think JoLynne is onto something here. The biggest problem many professional communicators have with YouTube is producing content in its native vocabulary. YouTubers don’t behave like traditional video journalists, and to have an impact on the platform on the scale we need to, perhaps we need to learn to blend in more there.</p>
<h3 id="the-youtube-question">The YouTube question</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Ian Silvera (who was a <a href="https://futurenews.substack.com/people/11025873-ian-silvera">rather lovely newsletter you should subscribe to</a>) had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>Good point on YouTube, Adam. Did you see the BBC Annual Report? 16 to 35-year-old demographic neck-and-neck between the BBC and YouTube. Think the big Q for outlets is whether to feed the beast or not after many tried and failed doing that with FB in the past. YouTube, though, is slightly different since it boosts a site's SEO (owned by Alphabet after all), so if played right -- and there's no easy answer to the 'right' way -- it should actually help outlets. The Sun, by way of example, have done some good original interviews on their YouTube channels.</blockquote>
<p>This is a topic I feel we need to come back to. YouTube is <em>huge</em> and quite possibly the second biggest search engine in the world, after Google. For many searches people head to YouTube, and seek their answers in video, not text.</p>
<p>I think Ian’s right that publishers are wary of heading there, but I’m not sure that it’s as much that they’ve been burnt by Facebook, as that they’ve been burnt by their own terrible experiences in the past. News organisations have been trying to make YouTube work for about 13 years now. I was certainly involved in early online video strategy sessions by around 2008/2009. However, for reasons I alluded to above, often their efforts were terrible, and were abandoned too quickly. Or, conversely, they spent way too much on them, making them unviable. </p>
<p>Which publishers are actually really killing it on YouTube? <em>Vox</em>, perhaps. But, at some level, it alarms me that we’re rushing off to play on TikTok without truly getting to grips with YouTube.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>You might have seen this tweet from me earlier (or possibly not — a mere 629 impressions right now off 21 engagements) but I’d like to explain my thinking a little:</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One lesson I learnt nearly two decades ago in the early days of blogging that you can apply to anything from Twitter to newsletters: look to see if people are merely promoting themselves, or if they are amplifying others. <br><br>Once you start doing that, it can be eye-opening.</p>— Adam Tinworth (@adders) <a href="https://twitter.com/adders/status/1316774827714322432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2020</a>

<p>It might look like I'm subtweeting someone, but I'm not. The general thought is one that's been informing me as I prune my social feeds a little.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of the disproportionate role Twitter plays in many journalists’ lives is that sometimes your prominence there is equated with your prominence in the industry. That’s not always a fair judgement.</p>
<p>And, as I’ve been spending more time on Twitter in recent weeks, I’ve noted how some people have managed to build themselves quite the presence in relation to their actual achievements by being relentlessly promotional, while others who I <em>know</em> to be doing excellent, game-changing work are flying under the radar because of their quiet (or non-existent) Twitter personas.</p>
<h3 id="the-omhb-interviews">The OM&HB Interviews</h3>
<p>I want to do my bit to change that. There are some people out there whose work should be better recognised, and I’d like to help bring them to the fore. That, in turn, should help the process of sharing experiences among people pushing at the digital frontiers of publishing.</p>
<p>So… I’m planning to start doing some interviews for the site, which I haven’t done for <em>ages</em>. I think the last time was around a year ago with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2019/10/ghost-3-0-has-built-in-membership-and-paywall-tools-to-build-engaged-journalism-sites/">John O’Nolan for the launch of Ghost 3.0</a> (and with 4.0 coming in 2021, maybe I should schedule something again…) and before that, probably <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2013/04/guardian-witness-joanna-geary/">Joanna Geary back in 2013</a>, while she was still at <em>The Guardian</em>, long before her ascension into the exalted heights of Twitter’s curation team.</p>
<p>I have a list of people I’d like to talk to, but I’m open to suggestions. Who do <em>you</em> think it would be interesting to hear me interviewing? (You are allowed to nominate yourself…)</p>
