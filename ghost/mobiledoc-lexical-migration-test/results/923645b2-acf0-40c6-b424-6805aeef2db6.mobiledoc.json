Players will find themselves in the vast, reclaimed wilderness of the island of Akama, surrounded by bits of ancient history and countless creatures known to the people of the island as the Ateyan. You will collect and battle with the Ateyan at your side, leveling up, crafting a team and strategies for many challenging combat scenarios, and ultimately fighting your way through the large towers that loom over the landscape of Akama. With a score crafted to seamlessly blendthe sounds of ancient technology with the wonders of an untamed wilderness,  a vast world, a gripping narrative filled with style and mystery, and hundreds of unique monsters to collect and battle with, we at Boundless Games hope to create an experience unlike any you've ever played. We hope you enter the world of Monster Tribe and get lost in its wonders!"

Using this magical spirit energy, the Ateyan have manifested wonderful powers of all kinds."

The island of Akama is very different from what it used to be. These days, the Ateyan only barely cling to the land. Their spirits wander the island, causing strange, supernatural occurrences where they roam. A few say they still see them floating around, but even they only describe faint balls of light. The creatures of the past are long gone and near forgotten. Similarly, the once grand civilization has become a mythic past; a grand life beyond imagination for the people of the present. That is, until one young man begins his spiritual journey."

          "Monster Tribe fuses strategy combat with rpg systems, item collection and dungeons filled with puzzles to pull the player into its world. But ultimately, this is a game all about exploration. The island of Akama is vast and wild, reclaimed by nature over many years. There are mountains, beaches, forests and mines, along with some scenery much less familiar. Remnants of vast ruins can be seen all throughout the land. In order to explore these strange - and sometimes dangerous - lands, you will need the help of the Ateyan. By binding your spirit to these creatures, you will be able to uncover the many secrets Akama has to offer. You will use the Ateyan to battle your way through the wilderness, and along the way there will be many unique resources to collect. Your tools will help you scavenge for rare ores and logs, and forage for food in the trees and beneath the waves. Resources will be a huge aid to both you and the Ateyan that choose to follow you, allowing you to unlock special fusion forms and power up your party. Once you feel ready, the player can take their team of Ateyan to one of the many Towers present throughout the island, to try to tackle the strange and mysterious dungeons and puzzles that await them there. Beyond these epic challenges lie answers to the mysteries of the past, and possibly a way forward for the people of the present."
