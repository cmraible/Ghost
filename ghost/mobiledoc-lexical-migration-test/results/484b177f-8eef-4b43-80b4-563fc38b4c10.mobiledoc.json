While the Camaro model didn't change much in regards to styling except for a minor facelift, it was apparent that GM was armed and ready to play in the high-performance market with this new model.

The exterior of this '85 Camaro IROC-Z is finished in black complete with contrasting gold IROC-Z graphics, hood louvers, and a rear lip spoiler. Unique stock wheels were given to this new performance model in the form of 16-inch five-spoke alloy wheels with gold accents are wrapped with the original Goodyear Eagle VR50 tires ( 245/50). Out back, the car wears Bilstein shocks. Everything looks to be in brand new condition, as it should considering how little it has seen the road."

Power is shifted to the rear wheels via a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Again with just 3,000 miles, the car hasn't been used enough to develop any wear or tear, so the interior appears in showroom condition. Factory interior equipment includes a power adjustable driver's seat, an AM/FM cassette player, power windows, and air conditioning. Factory gauges embedded in the dashboard include an 85-mph speedometer, a tachometer that redlines at 5,500-rpms, and other gauges that monitor important vital signs such as fuel level, coolant temperature, voltage, and oil pressure. The odometer is correct with just 3,134 actual miles. The heater core was replaced in July 2017, and the a/c system runs R12 refrigerant and does not run cold."
