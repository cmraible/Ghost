We are The Gender Beat: a collective of journalists who are interested in journalism that centers the experiences of women and gender-diverse people. We want to know who's doing this work, who's supporting it and who's funding it. To find out, we are conducting a short survey to understand the needs of the various members of the gender journalism ecosystem. We would be very grateful if you could spare the time to fill out this Google Form about your experiences. It will only take around 10 minutes. If you know someone whose insights you think would be useful to this project, please forward this survey to them. Alternatively, let us know by emailing thegenderbeat@protonmail.com and we'll get in touch directly. Please also let us know if you would rather take this survey in another language, and we will see if we can arrange a translated version for you. Best wishes, The team at The Gend",
