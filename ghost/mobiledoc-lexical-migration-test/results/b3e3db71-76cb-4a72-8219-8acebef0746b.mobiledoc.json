That’s the thing with these programs, they not only help bring in additional revenue which would’ve flowed to independent shops, they help build brand loyalty and increase the image of the company. Everyone who sees this beautifully restored Porsche will be mesmerized with how amazing the classic models are and that’s invaluable marketing these days."

As the automaker points out in a lengthy press release, this car had a soft rear window instead of the glass which Porsche switched to after too long. In fact, only 925 units with the upgraded S engine were made with the soft window from 1966 to 1968, so that alone makes this car quite rare and definitely worthy of a full restoration."
