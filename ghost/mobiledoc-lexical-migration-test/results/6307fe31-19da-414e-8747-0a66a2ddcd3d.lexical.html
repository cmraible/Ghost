<p><em>This is a column from Lever Weekly, our once-a-week review of what happened over the last week, exclusively for our paid subscribers. </em></p>
<p>When <em>The Lever</em>’s rail safety reporting suddenly dominated the national news cycle, I thought we had found an elusive glitch in the matrix — a story so powerful, so rooted in indisputable evidence, and so widely amplified that its most important facts could not be manipulated or suppressed.</p>
<p>This, I imagined, could be a rare moment in which politicians, corporate media, and people of all political persuasions would have to fess up to all the truths that we reported — the inconvenient truths exposing <em>both</em> political parties’ complicity in the deregulation of America’s railroads.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I’m gratified that our reporting has successfully shamed and forced regulators into <a href="__GHOST_URL__/buttigieg-pressured-into-promising-to-do-his-job/">finally promising</a> to improve policy. It will take more pressure to compel them to follow through, but this is a huge achievement — and proof that our subscribers’ support of our work is making a real impact.</p>
<p>However, even after our team landed a full-page <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/opinion/ohio-train-derailment-safety-regulation.html"><em>New York Times</em> op-ed</a> and our work was featured on major media platforms, my dream of an inflection point of honesty has proven to be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The partisan ghost still haunts the media machine, compelling it to tell only liberals’ preferred Donald Trump story, and avoid the Barack Obama cautionary tale — one that is just as significant, but might offend liberal audiences conditioned to reward only pro-Democrat, anti-Republican content.</p><!--members-only-->
<p>If you followed the national media’s coverage of East Palestine, Ohio last week, you likely heard one part of the story that <em>The Lever</em> first spotlighted: the story of Trump siding with rail industry lobbyists to repeal a rule that would have required some trains to use better braking technology.</p>
<p>Of course, the criticism of Trump’s decision is entirely justified. His move was nakedly corrupt, as is Republicans’ zeal for deregulation. And that tale of corruption quickly became The Narrative, with the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/22/white-house-blame-trump-gop-east-palestine-spill/11322623002/">White House</a>, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/visit-east-palestine-trump-picks-fight-cant-win-rcna71810">pundits</a>, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/cnn/cnns-bill-weir-describes-how-trump-administration-gutted-train-regulations-east-palestine">media outlets</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lincoln-project-trump-east-palestine-b2287400.html">Democratic super PACs</a>, and an army of blue-wave-emoji Twitter accounts all insinuating that Trump’s decision alone caused the Ohio disaster.</p>
<p>This isn’t particularly surprising. Democratic politicians, liberal pundits, and corporate media outlets have mastered the art of solely blaming Trump for problems that the past Democratic administration contributed to and the current Democratic administration has refused to fix. That train never derails. It is always on time.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that this anti-Trump narrative — while rooted in the facts of Trump’s decision to repeal the brake rule — has been extrapolated and distorted to the point of becoming a lie. And not just any old lie, but the most calculated kind of lie: a lie by deliberate omission.</p>
<p>That truth is clear: While Trump’s decision to repeal the brake was deplorable, Obama administration regulators had previously decided to ignore federal safety officials and side with chemical industry lobbyists to narrow the definition of “high-hazard flammable train.” That decision exempted trains like Norfolk Southern’s from <em>all</em> of the Obama-era hazmat train safety rules, including the brake rule. If you don’t believe that, just take a look at the source documents linked in the passage of our <em>New York Times</em> op-ed that summarized <a href="__GHOST_URL__/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/">our original reporting</a> on the events:</p>
<blockquote><strong>During the rulemaking process, the federal government’s National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/PHMSA-2012-0082-2637"><strong>told</strong></a> Obama officials that new regulations should cover not only crude oil, but Class 2 flammable gases such as liquefied petroleum gas and chemicals <a href="https://webwiser.nlm.nih.gov/WebWISER/substance?substanceId=43&identifier=Vinyl%20C%20monomer&identifierType=alias&menuItemId=2&catId=163"><strong>including</strong></a> vinyl chloride as well. Regulators noted that freight companies should offer greater transparency about cargo to the communities living along freight lines.</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Obama officials ultimately sided with a chemical industry <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/PHMSA-2012-0082-2556"><strong>lobbying group</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-05-08/html/2015-10670.htm"><strong>declaring</strong></a> that “expanding the definition to include all hazardous materials is beyond the scope” of the proposed rulemaking.</strong></blockquote>
<p>If you peruse the glut of national media coverage about the derailment, you will find almost no reference to this part of the story, even though it is the foundational deregulatory event — one just as pivotal as Trump’s subsequent decision to repeal the brake rule.</p>
<p>This was a key moment in which regulators opted to side with industry lobbyists on a huge safety question. And yet that decision is being memory-holed. Even self-appointed media <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/feb/24/fact-checking-trumps-i-had-nothing-to-do-with-it-r/">fact-checkers</a><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/feb/17/occupy-democrats/obama-era-safety-rule-high-hazard-trains-was-repea/">refuse</a><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/02/17/fact-check-false-claim-death-plume-raining-acid-ohio/11275138002/">to mention it</a>, saying only that the Ohio train was exempt from hazmat safety rules — without bothering to explain <em>why</em> — and rarely mentioning that the Biden White House had declined to use its regulatory authority to reverse both the Obama and Trump actions.</p>
<p>This kind of shadowbanning is destructive in myriad ways.</p>
<p>It allows credulous liberals to continue ensconcing themselves in a warm womb of ignorance, telling themselves comforting fables in which Republicans are the sole Bad Guys, and Democrats are always the Honorable Heroes, who never need to be held accountable. Without that accountability, Democratic politicians can rest easy knowing that they can issue press releases pledging to get tough on an issue like rail safety, but also knowing they may never have to actually deliver on those promises.</p>
<p>One of those promises should be fixing the specific problem that the Obama administration created and that both the Trump and Biden administration refused to address — the problem of explosive hazmat trains somehow still not being classified as “high-hazard flammable trains” and therefore still not being subjected to tougher safety mandates.</p>
<p>The good news is that this problem can be fixed by either Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg using his rulemaking authority to expand the definition to cover all hazmat trains, or by Congress statutorily requiring the definition to reflect the National Transportation Safety Board’s original demands.</p>
<p>But the bad news gets back to the shadowbanning: Because the story of Obama officials ignoring their safety regulators has been so thoroughly suppressed in favor of the “honorable Democrats, bad Republicans” tale, the problem — and the potential solution — are still getting too little attention.</p>
<p>That may be a relief for cost-cutting railroad CEOs who want the whole issue to go away, but it should be of serious concern for the rest of us that want to see political momentum not just for a few righteous social media dunks on Republicans, but for the actual enactment of new regulations that can make the railroads much safer.</p>
