<p>Good things are happening! In California, fast food workers are nearing the finish line in a long fight to transform workplace conditions for hundreds of thousands of employees. Talk about solidarity! Meanwhile, Boston is pushing to eliminate fossil fuels from new construction, while a judge has halted coal leases on federal lands. Also, Trader Joe‚Äôs and Amazon workers are making progress on new union drives, and nurses in Minnesota are going on strike by the thousands. </p>

<p>California state senators will vote on the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB257">Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery (FAST) Act</a> this month. The FAST Act would <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/15/23296481/fast-food-ab257-california-sectoral-labor-unions">establish</a> a new state council to create minimum working standards for fast food restaurants. It would also have the power to hold companies like McDonald‚Äôs and Burger King accountable for their franchisees‚Äô labor violations like wage theft and sexual harassment ‚Äî the sort of liability that franchises <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/15/23296481/fast-food-ab257-california-sectoral-labor-unions">usually</a> get to avoid.</p>
<p>There are over 500,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneKim/status/1559369192247332865">fast food workers</a> in California, two-thirds of whom are women and sixty percent of whom are Latinx. ‚ÄúThere may be no more consequential measure for labor rights in Sacramento this session,‚Äù <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-02/california-answer-for-worker-abuse-in-the-fast-food-industry">wrote</a><em>LA Times</em> columnist Michael Hiltzik.</p>
<p>Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Fight for $15 have <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/california-essential-workers-unions/">organized</a> more than <a href="http://fastfoodjusticeahora.com/supporters/#endorse">one hundred</a> organizations and unions in support of the legislation. Already, five city and county governments, including those of Los Angeles and San Francisco, have also come out in support of the act. This Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfor15/status/1557821400508948481">thread</a> breaks down how long people have been fighting to get to this point. Some workers are <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/politics/fast-food-workers-sleep-capitol-bill/103-5a0c71c3-a280-40ab-9316-2a3c344dab45">even</a> sleeping at the state capitol to demand action.</p>
<p>You can read about how the FAST Recovery Act would be a huge step toward broad-based bargaining <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/15/23296481/fast-food-ab257-california-sectoral-labor-unions">here</a>, and you can help demand action in solidarity with workers <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfor15/status/1557821400508948481">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="boston-wants-to-ban-fossil-fuels-for-new-buildings">Boston Wants To Ban Fossil Fuels For New Buildings</h3>
<p>Days after Governor Charlie Baker <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/14/science/ten-cities-towns-are-poised-ban-fossil-fuels-new-buildings/?p1=Article_Inline_Related_Link">announced</a> a new climate <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H5060">law</a> enabling ten Massachusetts cities and towns to ban fossil fuels in new buildings, Boston <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/16/science/boston-wants-ban-fossil-fuels-new-buildings/?event=event25">stepped up</a> to the plate to join the program. If the effort moves forward, Boston would join <a href="https://www.nysfocus.com/2021/11/18/nyc-gas-ban-fight-heats-up/">New York City</a>, <a href="https://barc.ca.gov/whats-happening/news/oakland-and-san-jose-ban-natural-gas-new-buildings">San Jose</a>, <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/seattle-bans-natural-gas-in-new-buildings">Seattle</a>, and <a href="https://earth.org/washington-dc-buildings-emission-free/">Washington D.C.</a> in enacting such a ban. According to Boston emissions <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/bostons-carbon-emissions#:~:text=Primary%20energy%20sources%20include%20gasoline,propane%20combined%20(%3C1%25).&text=GHGs%20reported%20in%20the%20waste,emissions%20(18%20thousand%20tCO2e).">data</a>, commercial, industrial, and residential buildings generated 70 percent of emissions in 2019, so Boston‚Äôs commitment to a ban could deliver real change.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur city is ready to join this pilot program to understand and lay out how banning new fossil fuel hookups can benefit our cities, our state, and our country,‚Äù Mayor Michelle Wu <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/16/science/boston-wants-ban-fossil-fuels-new-buildings/?event=event25">announced</a> at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<h3 id="coal-leasing-halted-on-federal-lands">Coal Leasing Halted On Federal Lands</h3>
<p>A federal judge in Montana <a href="https://grist.org/beacon/judge-halts-coal-leasing-on-federal-lands/">ordered</a> the Bureau of Land<strong></strong>Management to halt new coal leases on all federal lands, reinstating a ban repealed by the Trump administration in 2017.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Brian Morris found that the Trump administration‚Äôs review of coal sales inadequately considered coal‚Äôs impact on climate, violating the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Almost <a href="https://grist.org/beacon/judge-halts-coal-leasing-on-federal-lands/">half</a> of the country‚Äôs yearly coal supply is mined by private companies exploiting public, federally leased lands. Maintaining a NEPA review process that actually considers the impact of coal on climate is necessary to limit the power of coal companies.</p>

<h3 id="minnesota-nurses-go-on-strike">Minnesota Nurses Go On Strike</h3>
<p>As thousands of behavioral health care workers go on <a href="https://nuhw.org/more-than-2000-kaiser-permanente-mental-health-clinicians-to-start-open-ended-strike-august-15/">strike</a> in California, 15,000 nurses with the Minnesota Nurses Association voted to <a href="https://mnnurses.org/breaking-15000-nurses-authorize-strike-hold-media-availability-tomorrow/">strike</a> for fair contracts and demand that patients be prioritized above profits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHospital executives with million-dollar salaries have created a crisis of retention and care in our healthcare system, as more nurses are leaving the bedside, putting quality patient care at risk,‚Äù said Mary C. Turner, a registered nurse at North Memorial Hospital, in the union‚Äôs <a href="https://mnnurses.org/breaking-15000-nurses-authorize-strike-hold-media-availability-tomorrow/">statement</a>. ‚ÄúNurses do not take this decision lightly, but we are determined to take a stand at the bargaining table, and on the sidewalk if necessary, to put patients before profits in our hospitals.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="trader-joe%E2%80%99s-and-amazon-unionization-momentum">Trader Joe‚Äôs And Amazon Unionization Momentum</h3>
<p>Late last week, a Trader Joe‚Äôs store in Minneapolis became the second of the grocery chain‚Äôs five hundred-plus locations to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trader-joes-workers-unionize-second-store-minneapolis_n_62f4181ae4b095e7887d1c38">unionize</a>. Meanwhile, workers at a store in Boulder, Colorado, are poised to push for a third. Looking at organizing efforts across the country at companies like Starbucks, Sarah Beth Ryther, a worker at the Minneapolis Trader Joe‚Äôs, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/8/13/23299622/trader-joes-starbucks-union-movement">told</a><em>Vox</em>, ‚ÄúWe really and truly are interested in creating a larger movement because we are all going through the same things.‚Äù</p>
<p>On Tuesday, near Albany, Amazon workers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/amazon-workers-at-warehouse-near-albany-file-for-union-election.html">filed</a> to form a union with the National Labor Relations Board, making it the <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenKGurley/status/1559652355758587907">fifth</a> warehouse location to do so. Lead organizer Heather Goodall told the <a href="https://www.albanyproper.com/inside-the-fight-to-unionize-amazons-alb1/"><em>Albany Proper</em></a><em>, </em>‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt stop until Amazon listens. They are eventually going to have to concede.‚Äù</p>

<p>After all the news this week, take a moment to read Tracy K. Smith‚Äôs poem on the future, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55516/sci-fi">Sci-Fi</a>‚Äù:</p>
<p><em>There will be no edges, but curves.</em></p>
<p><em>Clean lines pointing only forward.</em><br></p>
<p><em>History, with its hard spine & dog-eared</em></p>
<p><em>Corners, will be replaced with nuance,</em><br></p>
<p><em>Just like the dinosaurs gave way</em></p>
<p><em>To mounds and mounds of ice.</em><br></p>
<p><em>Women will still be women, but</em></p>
<p><em>The distinction will be empty. Sex,</em><br></p>
<p><em>Having outlived every threat, will gratify</em></p>
<p><em>Only the mind, which is where it will exist.</em><br></p>
<p><em>For kicks, we‚Äôll dance for ourselves</em></p>
<p><em>Before mirrors studded with golden bulbs.</em><br></p>
<p><em>The oldest among us will recognize that glow‚Äî</em></p>
<p><em>But the word sun will have been re-assigned</em><br></p>
<p><em>To the Standard Uranium-Neutralizing device</em></p>
<p><em>Found in households and nursing homes.</em><br></p>
<p><em>And yes, we‚Äôll live to be much older, thanks</em></p>
<p><em>To popular consensus. Weightless, unhinged,</em><br></p>
<p><em>Eons from even our own moon, we‚Äôll drift</em></p>
<p><em>In the haze of space, which will be, once</em><br></p>
<p><em>And for all, scrutable and safe.</em></p>
