As one of the top dealerships in the Southeastern United States, and named 44 in the nation for Corvette dealers by Corvette Blogger, Maxie Price Chevrolet is usually well-stocked with just about any vehicle you could want. But, as you can see in the photo she provided, a lot where Chevrolet Corvettes, Silverados, Colorados, and Camaros would be lined up in the hundreds is virtually empty. Instead of people asking, “where’s Loganville?” they’re probably asking, “where are all the cars?”"

Hopefully something changes in the new future, like government regulations allowing automakers to produce purely analog new cars again. We can only dream."
