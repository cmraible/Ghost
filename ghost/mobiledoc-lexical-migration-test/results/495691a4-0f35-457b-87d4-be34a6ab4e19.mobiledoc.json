A relatively lightweight, high-powered, rear-wheel-drive car can be a handful for someone lacking experience. Many guys don’t want to admit they don’t know how to handle such a machine because that would be a blow to their ego. A worse blow is crashing the supercar and having to pay the high cost of repairs, but shortsightedness seems to be their downfall. Just learn from these stupid mistakes and don’t do the same thing if you ever find yourself in this position."
