Appropriately named Split Second, this heavily modified muscle car isn’t messing around one bit. This is the kind of build Chevy guys point to when their Mustang-loving friends start trashing their car, only for their friend to complain it’s not a factory build. We don’t care about any of that because this machine is simply amazing and that’s it."

To get that kind of power, the Roadster Shop turned to Nelson Racing Engines, which put together a kiler 427ci small block V8 Street Warrior with twin 73mm turbos. Feeding that thirsty setup is a dual fuel system with 16 injectors and a custom-built fuel tank. Sure, it can’t be cheap to run, but with 1,500-hp who cares?"

Helping keep the tire contact patches on the pavement without punishing the driver and passenger are Fox SV 4.0 shocks. Stopping duty is performed by Brembo Gran Turismo Brakes with 14-inch rotors."

Underneath the skin is a Roadster Shop Fast Track Chassis, in case you’re wondering. It’s been lowered so it sits about 4.5 inches off the ground, keeping that center of gravity nice and low. Of course, the rumble of the force-fed small block and burble of the exhaust are also clear signals this is one badass Camaro."
