These cars were made with a V6 or V8 engine, a racing chassis, enclosed cockpits, and more aerodynamic body panels. In other words, they were a far cry from the C4 street Corvettes."

As you can clearly see, the engine sits mid-ship instead of in front of the driver, long before GM pulled the trigger and did a similar layout with the C8."

The fact Sarel van der Merwe and Doc Bundy piloted it to victory back in 1986, and that it was owned by Gordon Barrett surely helped with pumping up interest. The proud new owner should have a great time flogging this thing on the track."
