Originally, Duesenberg planned to make 13 Model Xs, but only four are known to exist today, with some debate about whether the other nine were ever assembled or not. An improved version of the Model A, it used a stronger motor and improved suspension. Production was tabled by E.L. Cord once he took over the company, with that production never resumed."

The red exterior has a nice polish, plus appropriate chrome pieces and the famous hood ornament. Wire-spoke wheels and whitewall tires, including dual fender-mounted spares, are included in the setup. There’s also  trunk strapped to the rear board, which is covered in the same tan cloth as the convertible top."
