<p>For many <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/5007/1995-dodge-viper-r-t-10-roadster?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mar21">the Dodge Viper</a> is a true dream car. Originally intended as a modern version of the roadster, what ended up being created could in a way be contributed to what an AC Cobra might look like if production and development had continued into the modern age. Early on, developers seemed to have blinders on when it came to <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/5007/1995-dodge-viper-r-t-10-roadster?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mar21">the Viper</a> and were laser focused on performance. In a time when the industry was moving towards increased safety standards and luxury-like comfort features, the Viper was more concerned with speed.</p>

<p>Despite five generations of production spread over nearly 30-years, an estimated 31,500 <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/5007/1995-dodge-viper-r-t-10-roadster?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mar21">Vipers</a> were made in total. The rarest year was the first but once Dodge worked out the kinks, production spiked in 1994. In 1995, Dodge cut production numbers in half making these cars a pretty rare sight. <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/5007/1995-dodge-viper-r-t-10-roadster?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mar21">Premier Auction Group</a> is offering enthusiasts the opportunity to get behind the wheel of one of the awesome roadsters. </p>
