It’s funny to hear the hoonigan team joke around with the owner about what kind of a school bus he must’ve taken that turbocharger off of, but when you really look at it it’s hard to know if they’re kidding or not. Altogether, this vehicle makes somewhere in the ballpark of 900 hp which is pretty crazy for such a small car.

However, by the time the Civic got to the finish line, the two vehicles were neck and neck and the Civic only barely won because of the truck's difficulty in the traction department. Round two, that issue got sorted out entirely and the truck left the Civic in the dust like it wasn’t even moving. Finally, round three was upon them and this time the civic wasn’t playing around in terms of milking every advantage it had in the beginning of the race.
