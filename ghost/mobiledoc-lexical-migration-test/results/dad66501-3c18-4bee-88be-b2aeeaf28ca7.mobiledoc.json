Bentley’s twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 engine is factory tuned to achieve an output of 592-horsepower and 553 lb.-ft of torque. An all-wheel-drive system divides this power between all four wheels and a unique torque-vectoring rear end ensures a smooth application of that power to the ground. "

This and the implementation of shorter gearing ratios, a sport-tuned Electronic Stability Control, and a Carbon Silicon Carbide braking system makes the GT3-R one of the fastest and most nimble road-going cars Bentley has ever made. According to the British automaker, the car is capable of a 0-60-mph sprint in as little as 3.4 seconds but there are reports that independent testing has resulted in a 3.3-second run."

A bespoke interior in Beluga black and green with diamond-quilted Alcantara upholstery is still representative of a high end luxury car. But Carbon fiber trim and GT3-R badging throughout refuse to let the driver forget about the car's sporty capabilities."
