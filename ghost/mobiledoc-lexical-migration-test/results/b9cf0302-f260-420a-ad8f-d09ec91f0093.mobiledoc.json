This is the exact sort of thing we hate hearing about, because it could happen to anyone at anytime with little to no warning. We know a lot of people will want to blame the authorities for the chase, others will want to blame Dodge for making a car which can go fast, but in the end the responsibility for all this rests with the driver who decided to put everyone at risk."

Instead of just blowing that huge speed violation off, the trooper started a pursuit, which is exactly what you would expect. After all, if laws aren’t enforced, what good are they really?"
