          "Back in 2005 Mr. & Mrs. Smith starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie was a huge box office hit. There’s something fascinating to people about seeing a husband and wife face off in such an aggressive way – we don’t get what it is. Instead, we prefer to watch a husband and wife race each other in their Jeep Trackhawk and Durango Hellcat since that’s infinitely more interesting."

          "Many Mopar enthusiasts who have a family have gravitated to the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk as a compromise. Yeah, it’s one of those stylish crossovers which mean you’re still a good parent without driving a minivan, but it’s packing one hell of a punch with the supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 we all know and love from the Hellcat. That means 707-horsepower and 645 lb.-ft. of torque are on tap, moving all 5,356 lbs. of this Jeep forward with ferocity."

There are many factors affecting how quickly a car can make it down the dragstrip, which keeps the sport interesting. What’s more, these two are competing in a bracket style race, before anyone accuses the Durango Hellcat driver of cheating or jumping the light."
