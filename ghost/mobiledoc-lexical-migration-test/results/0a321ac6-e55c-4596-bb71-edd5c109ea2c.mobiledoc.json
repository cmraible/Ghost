You can hardly blame them, considering there was only one ever built and it was pretty much lost to the world for a while. Thankfully, Petersen Automotive Museum has this concept or dream car perfectly preserved and recently released a video to give everyone a look at what the Explorer is all about."

          "The design of the Plymouth Explorer has the distinctive flair of Carrozzeria Ghia all over it.  The automotive design firm based in Turin, Italy boasts a long list of some of the most beautiful cars ever to grace public roads, from the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia you undoubtedly know well to the Lancia Aurelia B20 GT. As a result, the Explorer has an Italian sensibility to its aesthetics, setting it apart from other American cars of the time, especially from Chrysler."

Fine leather upholstery, radio controls hidden by a panel in the dash, and fitted luggage made for one luxurious ride. It’s not difficult to see how the Explorer would have elevated Plymouth’s image in the market had it been made available to the public, but one has to ask if the move would’ve worked? After all, the brand had always been viewed as a sensible, working man’s choice, not a thing of opulence or even abundant luxury."
