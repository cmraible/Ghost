I – like my colleagues – was encouraged to be anonymous. It was the story that counted, not the person who happened to write it.\n\nWhat mattered – and this was especially true in business journalism – was the name of the mag, not the journalist. That was what people believed in, engaged with, paid for.\n\nWith the exception of a few columnists employed to be the face of predictably polarised views, most journalists remained in the background. They got a byline if they were lucky.\n\n\n## Putting the personality back into journalists\n\nBlogging has changed that. It’s put the personality back into journalists who forgot they had it.\n\nJournalists, many of whom had forgotten how to have an opinion, are now being actively encouraged to express themselves and they’re relishing it. They’ve found a voice, and readers are loving it.\n\nBlogs can be all sorts of things (no one seems to have nailed a conclusive definition yet), but the ones I most enjoy are those which one person writes because it’s that person’s preoccupations, personality and voice that comes through. Individuality counts.\n\nOne of my interests, for example, is books – and my favourite book blog is Scott Pack’s [Me and My Big Mouth](http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/) (with the exception of *One Man and His Blog*, incidentally, one of the best named blogs around).\n\nAt Farmers Weekly, our growing stable of bloggers are increasingly recognised for – and identified by – their individual personalities. [Matthew Naylor](http://www.fwi.co.uk/blogs/lincolnshire-farming-blog/) is irreverent and witty. [Phil Clarke](http://www.fwi.co.uk/blogs/agribusiness/), authoritative and analytical. If you want to know about cows and sheep (and why wouldn’t you?) [Jon Long](http://www.fwi.co.uk/blogs/livestock-and-sales-blog/)‘s your man.\n\nI, meanwhile, do stuff on [Field Day](http://www.fwi.co.uk/blogs/rural-life/) that my colleagues occasionally dub fringe and frothy. But just as journalists’ approach is changing, so subjects off limits even a year ago are now legitimate content, as blogs offer new ways to deliver content and make readers’ demands more eclectic.\n\n\n## An excess of personality?\n\nThere are some who argue that there’s too much personality out there already and the blogosphere has merely exacerbated this. What we want, so some people say, is more facts and informed opinion, not more personality.\n\nBut it is possible to have both – and a lot of good journalists traditionally have. It’s just that they never had the chance to showcase it. \n\nThank heavens blogging has given them the opportunity to.\n\n\n"
