<p>For this week’s Switch Kickstarter Project of the Week, we will be looking at The Shady Gentlemen and Top Hat Studio’s <em>Steamdolls – Order of Chaos</em>. The game is slated to release in May 2021 on PC, Mac, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5 and Xbox One/Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Here’s the overview:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p><strong>SteamDolls is a steampunk inspired metroidvania game with a grimy touch of</strong><strong>brutality.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You</strong> are <strong>The Whisper</strong> – voiced by <strong>David Hayter (The Legendary Solid Snake)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Blast your way to your objective or stick to the shadows and perform <strong>violent assassinations</strong>on unsuspecting guards, as you struggle with the haunting apparitions of a mesmerizing witch trying to <strong>reveal the truth</strong> about a <strong>conspiracy</strong> that could shake the very foundation of the world.</p>
    <p><strong>ACTION, EXPLORATION, STEALTH, AND BLOOD</strong>.</p>
    <p>Inspired by games like <strong>Castlevania</strong> and <strong>Hollow knight</strong>. Nourished by the fury of <strong>Dead Cells</strong>and the gloom of <strong>Bloodborne</strong>. A touch of societal decay from <strong>Dishonored</strong>. Lose yourself in a labyrinthine city, full of secrets and madness.</p>
    <p><strong>Story</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Society crumbled over time</strong>, falling into a state of disarray. <strong>Innovation became stagnation</strong>. Progression to regression. Not future, nor past. <strong>An industrial era haunted by the ghost of what came before. Mankind, their mentality ever worsening as idle habits fed into the City.</strong> Unified and tortuous, it swallowed what remained of their humanity. <strong>Stealing away their free will</strong>, their determination. <strong>Crushing their souls</strong> until nothing remained. <strong>Madness</strong>.</p>
    <p>Desperate for an alternative way to regain the glory of Old, <strong>scientists searched for a remedy</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Until they found something. Something that should have been left alone.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Mindless citizens</strong>, the needed catalyst. <strong>Transforming them</strong>. <strong>Adapting their flesh</strong>. Mere dolls. <strong>Cruel monsters</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Discover</strong> the truth of these <strong>broken lives in the lore of Steamdolls : Order of Chaos</strong>.</p>
    <p>In <strong>Steamdolls</strong>, you assume the role of a cunning <strong>thief</strong> and <strong>anarchist</strong>  known as “<strong>The Whisper</strong>” and make your way through heavily secured  environments. (<strong>Dubbed by Mr. David Hayter</strong>).</p>

<p>It’s not very often that you first glance at a game and instantly realise that you are looking at an absolutely masterpiece. That was my first reaction with <em>Steamdolls – Order of Chaos</em> as I looked upon the game’s stunning and unique neo-steampunk setting. One commendable aspect is <em>Steamdolls</em> has to be its immaculate lighting effects that gives its world a sense of eeriness. Not only that, but the original voice actor for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>‘s Solid Snake David Hayter will also be voicing the protagonist, which is all kind of amazing. <em>Steamdolls – Order of Chaos</em> is a game on my, and hopefully many more’s, radar.</p>
<p><em>Steamdolls – Order of Chaos</em> required £30,000 and it is currently sitting at £48,190 after 696 backers with 25 days remaining. Considering that this project has already reached its initial goal, we then look toward its Stretch Goals. The next goal is aiming for £52,000 with more <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> voice talent.
