            "text": ", production had started the year before, and since then, America has been craving even more Mustangs. Having sold over 500,000 'Stangs during the 1965 production year, Ford had done something very suitable for the great car we all know and love today. Despite the incredible production numbers from the first generations of the Mustang, the number of these cars still on the road is dwindling, as with any classic car. It's getting difficult to find these cars in good condition for a reasonable price, and opportunities only come so often in collecting classics. So what if you want a vintage first-gen 'Stang of your own?",
