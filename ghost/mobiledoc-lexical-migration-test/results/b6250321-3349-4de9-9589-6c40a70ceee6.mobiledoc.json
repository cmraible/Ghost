          "With Audi begrudgingly announcing it has halted development of new internal-combustion engines, now would be a great time to snap up something like this 2015 Audi R8. It titillates with a snarling 4.2-liter V8, the kind of engine which sadly is about to become an endangered species. That means you get to keep this to yourself and the value of this R8 is likely to appreciate nicely, especially since the previous owners only put 5,016 miles on this beauty."

The smooth yet hard-hitting V8 pairs with Audi’s legendary quattro all-wheel drive, allowing you to whip this ride through turns at maximum precision. If you’ve experienced quattro before, you know how it makes the car respond in ways that will blow you away. What’s more, the R8 has an aluminum monocoque, keeping chassis flex to a minimum for even more road-holding performance."

A flat-bottom steering wheel adds to the race car-inspired feel of this ride. Other premium features like leather upholstery, power equipment, etc. keep you nice and comfortable, just like what you’d expect from any Audi."
