Maybe kids were exposed to the band’s logo with dual revolvers and roses and decided to look up the “new” group on Spotify, similar to what happened when Metallic performed during the Grammys a while back. And perhaps this inspired some old fans to pull out their records, cassettes, and CDs to jam out on their home hi-fi system."

But not Dream Theater since there would be constant questions about who that even is. In all seriousness, it’s a welcome change to pharmaceutical brands and socio-political causes because rock and roll unites the people forever, or so Bill and Ted taught us."
