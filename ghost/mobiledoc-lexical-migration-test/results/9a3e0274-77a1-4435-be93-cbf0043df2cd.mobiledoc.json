Although the listing doesn't mention which member of the royal family drove this car, Prince Charles is known fondness of Aston Martins. Since 2016, two additional people have owned this Aston Martin, but despite being 17 years old, this high-powered Vanquish has just over 16,709 original miles. More importantly, it has been well maintained having recently been serviced and given a new clutch."

Performance figures include a 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds along with a 190-mph top speed, but we doubt this exotic grand touring coupe has been pushed too hard in its life. To prove the validity of its royal origins, this car is sold with a detailed history and a letter confirming the required registration plate change once it was sold to a private owner in 2016."
