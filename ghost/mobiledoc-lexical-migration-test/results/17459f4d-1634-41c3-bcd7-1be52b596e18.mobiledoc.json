While all that helps with cramming more oxygen into the cylinders with each intake, high-flow fuel injectors complement that with more fuel. Of course, an HPE calibration upgrade is necessary for all that to work, plus ta crank case ventilation system is added."

The two cars were pitted against each other on an unprepped surface and they did a rolling start, so the results are more like what you would get street racing instead of going to the local drag strip. Still, it’s interesting to see how much the Hennessey-tuned Hellcat Redeye gaps the Super Stock. Maybe if they removed the splitter guard things would be different?"
