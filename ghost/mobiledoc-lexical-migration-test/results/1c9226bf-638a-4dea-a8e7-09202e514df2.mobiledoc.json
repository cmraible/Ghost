While even at 17 feet 6 inches long, the Pontiac Grand Prix which was redesigned for 1969 wasn’t the largest model in the brand’s lineup, but it was big on dramatic flair. Plus, it holds the record of the longest hood in production car history. This "

Plus you get to enjoy power steering and power brakes, making this machine far easier to handle than without. That all amounts to a nice dose of some American work ethic wrapped in a classy package."
