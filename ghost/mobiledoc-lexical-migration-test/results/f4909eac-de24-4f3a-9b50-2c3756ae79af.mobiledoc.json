          " is the perfect mid-engine sports car for anyone who wants a piece of Porsche history that is both unique and reliable on the track. This car is regarded as the beginning of modern mid-engine performance as virtually every mid-engine car in modern times utilizes a similar design to this car. You may be underwhelmed by the meer 100 horsepower that this 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is putting out. However, the handling makes up for that intensely because of the cars' near 50/50 weight distribution. That means that you can rip through the track faster than something with two or even three times the amount of power this thing has. The LE 914 was available in two colors, black and yellow, called the Bumblebee and the equally rare orange and white trim seen here affectionately called Creamsicle."

However, if you look at the car long enough, you will notice small details like the aerodynamic door handles. That means that no one will be prepared for you to beat them in any autocross or road racing events. While these cars can typically be pretty hard to find, due to the owner's unwillingness to part with the vehicles, this vehicle presents an opportunity to get your hands on a piece of Porsche design history.
