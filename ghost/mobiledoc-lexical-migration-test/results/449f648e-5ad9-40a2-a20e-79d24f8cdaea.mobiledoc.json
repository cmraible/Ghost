It looks like the front and rear of the Chevy took a beating, the engine ejecting itself onto the side of the road as the entire front frame was ripped free. The rear hatch and most of the rear portion of the body is gone, as are the outer door panels. Both airbags in the dash were also obviously deployed."

The injuries sustained by the driver and passenger were so serious both had to be airlifted to a hospital. Let’s hope they pull through and the young man who was driving learns a valuable lesson about not pushing beyond one’s skills and road conditions."
