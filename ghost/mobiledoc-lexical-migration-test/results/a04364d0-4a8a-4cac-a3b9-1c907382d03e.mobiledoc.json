In 1970, styling for the fourth generation peaked with a complete front and rear end redesign and a boost in power thanks to the new 455-cid engine. However, after that year, the automaker moved the model down in rank to make room at the top for the Grand Ville series. However, the new model did not seem up for the task and just five model years later it was kicked to the curb, making the Bonneville number one once again."

Finished in its original Honduras Maroon paint, this car is equipped with the original 400-cid engine and turbo automatic transmission. An extensive service was completed about 1,000 miles ago, in which all of the consumables such as the brakes, tires, belts, and hoses were replaced. Additionally, the carburetor was rebuilt and a new muffler was installed. "
