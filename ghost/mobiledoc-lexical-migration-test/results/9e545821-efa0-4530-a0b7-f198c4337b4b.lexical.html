<p>Of course, this Camaro Pace Car is more than just good-looking. With an L35 396ci V8 putting 325-horsepower on tap it really moves. Thanks to the TH400 automatic transmission, you don’t need to worry about managing a clutch and shifter, but instead can just sit back and enjoy the ride. Instead of just imagining what this car is like, <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car">enter WIN</a> as your code to get double tickets and up your chances of driving away in this Chevy.</p>
<p>Some nice conveniences come on this ride, like the power convertible top, so you’re not having to get out and deal with an unmanageable soft top. A tilt column has been added, making it easier to get comfortable in this ride. Power steering and power disc brakes really help with keeping the powerful car in check. The lucky person who wins this car even gets factory air conditioning, so this ride is enjoyable throughout the heat of the summer. If you want that to be you, <a href="https://www.rmhc-car.com/1969-camaro-pace-car">use code WIN</a> to double your entries.</p>
