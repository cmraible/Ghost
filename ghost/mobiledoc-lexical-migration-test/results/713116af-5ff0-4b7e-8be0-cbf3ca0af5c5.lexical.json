These tiny vehicles boasted potent yet small, four-cylinder engines whose reputation for speed made the cars the perfect choice for any hot-blooded driver ready for some action. But, of course, to drive one of these cars, you had to be prepared for the ride of your lifetime, and that came in the form of a short wheelbase, lightweight body, and your choice of coupe or roadster body types. This particular vehicle was an iconic car for its day because of the sleek Porsche style that still stands out to this day. So what car is so incredible that it deserves the title of the best Porsche representative from the mid-1960s?",
