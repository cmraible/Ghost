<h3 id="are-you-seeking-killer-looks-with-ultimate-power-check-out-this-1961-ford-f100-pick-up-with-mustang-v8-power-heading-to-auction-with-leake">Are you seeking killer looks with ultimate power?  Check out this 1961 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1950-ford-f100-pickup-truck/">Ford F100</a> Pick-up with Mustang V8 power heading to auction with Leake</h3>
<p>Culture dictates that jet-black trucks are driven by those with murderous intentions. Boasting of wipe clean cabs and enough hauling space for several batches of suspiciously rolled-up carpet, the greatest attribute for catching victims forever remains that V8 powerplant. A classic truck simply isn’t worth anything without an eight-cylinder engine. End of.</p>
<p>With that mantra in mind, <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/34527/1961-Ford-F100/">what we have here with Leake Auctions</a> is the ultimate ‘package’ disposal unit. Not only does the truck appear sinister and stylishly aggressive, but an almighty secret lurks under the hood. When turning the ignition, it’s not the original 1961 Ford F100 drivetrain firing itself up. Instead, a 4.6-liter <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/2019-ford-mustang-bullitt-test-drive-review/">Mustang Bullitt</a> fuel-injected V8 rumbles into life – lifted from Ford's 2007 anniversary model.</p>

<p>This get-up is mated to a 5-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes, and power rack and pinion steering to produce a definitive blend of modern performance and retro looks. It’s <em>Jeepers Creepers</em> on steroids. <br><br>Official figures aren’t listed but, going from Ford’s 4.6-litre V8 data, we’d estimate a nought to 60mph time around 7 seconds and top speed of around 125mph. What we can confirm is that this 1961 F100 has 315bhp on tap. Prepare your budget for dozens of rear tires.</p>
<p>The interior fittings aren't quite as brutal as the Ford’s power delivery, however. There’s air conditioning that blows ice cold, an Ididit tilt column, Dolphin gauges and fresh cabin trim. If you get blood on the leather interior, it should be easily cleaned, too. Which is a bonus.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/34527/1961-Ford-F100/">this 1961 Ford F100/Mustang V8</a> makes for the perfect addition to your garage. Having undergoing a frame-off rebuild when installing the 4.6-liter powerplant, this beast will drive like nothing else.</p>
<p>Just wait until you pull up at the lights and somebody wants to race, assuming this is ‘just another Grandad wagon’. Relish the look on their face as you smoke them. Before you then murder them. <br><br>Get a closer look at the awesome truck, heading to the <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/consignments/?auction_filter=TULSA19&qry=&year_filter=&make_filter=&model_filter=&run_day_filter=&sort_by=&pagenumber=1">Tulsa auction on June 6-8</a>, with <a href="https://www.leakecar.com/vehicle/34527/1961-Ford-F100/">Leake Auctions</a>. <br><br><br></p>
