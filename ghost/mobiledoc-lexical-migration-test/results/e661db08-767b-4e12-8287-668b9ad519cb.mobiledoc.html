<p>What appears to be an insanely clean <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9483&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">vintage Galaxie</a> has something far more sinister lurking below its hood. Imagine parking at the car show, popping the hood, and gauging the reactions of unsuspecting bystanders when they realize just what kind of heat this ole girl is packin’.</p>
<p>Powering this <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9483&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">classic Galaxie</a> is a modern Coyote 5.0L V8 mated to a pair of twin turbochargers. A 6R80 automatic transmission with a first-generation Lokar electronic sport mode shifter sends power down to the rear wheels. For added performance and rumble, a 3-inch stainless steel exhaust was added.</p>

<p>When a car is capable of this much power, a heavy-duty suspension is required to back it up. To keep this beast in check is a RideTech rear suspension along with QA1 coilover shocks and tubular control arms. Electric power steering makes turning a breeze and stopping is provided by 13-inch Wilwood brakes. A set of Billet Specialty Heritage wheels wrapped with Nitto rubber grace the exterior. Behind the Galaxie’s doors is a full OEM interior covered in burgundy leather and complete with Vintage air conditioning.</p>
<p>The build started with an all-original 17,000-mile <a href="http://www.carlisleauctions.com/view-consignment-detail.aspx?ConsignmentID=9483&utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">Galaxie 500XL</a>. From there, this restomod was taken to a whole new level.  To accommodate the large modern drivetrain, the crossmember, inner fenders, control arms, wheel arches, firewall were all modified. In addition, the rear quarters were also fabricated with raised wheel arches. Its sleek body is slathered in a mesmerizing Axalta Charcoal paint. This car took home the Good Guys first place award.</p>
