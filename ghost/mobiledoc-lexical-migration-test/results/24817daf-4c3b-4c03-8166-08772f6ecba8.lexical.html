<p>The <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/vehicles/28618/2018-custom-1968-dodge-polara-zocchi?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">1968 Dodge Polara</a> coupe was an amazingly stylish car for its day with its inset headlights, sculpted wheel openings and a crazy long body crease just over the rear wheels. But this fully customized Polara takes things to the next level accentuating the car's natural lines and giving it some California attitude.This custom Dodge was created by Richard Zocchi's Custom Cars of Walnut Creek, California, and it was auctioned off through <a href="https://www.gaaclassiccars.com/?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious" rel="nofollow noopener">GAA Classic Cars</a> where it hammered for $40,000.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.zocchicustomcars.com/1968-dodge-polara/">Zocchi's site</a>, this Polara is an award-winning car brining home first place at both the 2010 Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, California and Sacramento AutoRama. From the looks of it, this car's body is almost completely custom while retaining the Polara's unique profile. The front end features a cleaner version of the Polara's original grille, and some of the hood metal has been shaved away to create a smoother leading edge. The chopped top, shaved handles and lowered stance all give this custom Polara an amazing look, but it's the rear end that really makes this car pop.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, those full-width taillights are original, but the car's original subtle attempt at fins have been upgraded to a set of prominent, Cadillac-esque fins. To finish off the custom look, this 1968 Dodge Polara received a vanilla and butterscotch pearl exterior paint as well as matching ultrasuede interior. It's obvious a lot of love and labor went into the creation of this car, and the hard work has definitely paid off. The $40,000 price tag for this custom Dodge seems like a great bargain for the winning bidder!</p>
<p>This one-of-a-kind Polara is an excellent example of the caliber of cars auctioned off through GAA Classic Cars, so stay tuned next year (February 27-29, July 23-25 and November 5-7) when even more classic and collectible vehicles will be auctioned off in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>
