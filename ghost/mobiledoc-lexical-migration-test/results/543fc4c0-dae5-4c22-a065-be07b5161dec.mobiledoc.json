Donated by Cobra restorer David Wagner of Classic Motorsports is a Tremec TKO-600 transmission shifts power down to the rear wheels. Other modifications include a 17-gallon stainless steel tank, high-performance aluminum radiator with dual electric fans, aluminum limited-slip differential, and Wilwood power disc 4-piston brakes. This slick roadster generates 510-horsepower. Along the side sit silver ceramic-coated pipes that provide additional rumble to the beefy V8. Inside the cockpit features period-correct Smiths gauges and a Lucas Amp gauge. Even better, the car comes with a 2-year/24,000-mile limited warranty."
