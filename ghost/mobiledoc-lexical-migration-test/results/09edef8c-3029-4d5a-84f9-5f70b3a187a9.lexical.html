<p>Not only is this <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-shelby-cobra/">Cobra</a> a looker, it was made to move. A Ford Racing 302ci V8 bored and stroked to 363ci produces a stout 500-horsepower and 450 lb.-ft. of torque. Included in that setup are 4 Weber carburetors with velocity stacks, aluminum heads, a hydraulic roller cam, “R” valve covers, ceramic-coated headers and side pipes, Tremec TKO-600 5-speed manual transmission, 3.54:1 ratio limited-slip Salisbury differential with oil cooler, plus an aluminum single-core high-performance radiator.</p>
<p>This car is a replica of the five legendary cars which, along with the Daytona Coupes, won the 1965 World Manufacturers Championship. To help commemorate its importance, this car’s dash has been signed by Allen Grant, Bob Bondurant, and Pete Brock.</p>
