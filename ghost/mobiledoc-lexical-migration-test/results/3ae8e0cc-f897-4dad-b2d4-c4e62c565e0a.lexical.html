<hr>
<p>In 1983, world-renowned Volkswagen tuner Gene Berg purchased a white <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1983-volkswagen-beetle/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> from a Tijuana VW dealership. He then united it with a red and a blue example that he kept on display at his orange county shop. The <a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1983-volkswagen-beetle/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> stayed in his private collection until he died in 1996. Although it has been passed around from collector to collector since then, it still remains in the same, like new condition and has only ever been driven 121-miles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/1983-volkswagen-beetle/?utm_source=motorious&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=beetle">The white exterior finish</a> is in perfect condition and the interior is still in the wrapper. Vinyl and houndstooth seats complement the black and white themed interior perfectly and the dashboard is simple, with only a single gauge and a glovebox. A 1600cc flat-four engine utilizes twin-port cylinder heads, a point ignition, and a single-barrel carburetor to deliver about 57-horsepower to the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual gearbox. It is also equipped with a 12-volt electrical system and drum brakes.</p>
