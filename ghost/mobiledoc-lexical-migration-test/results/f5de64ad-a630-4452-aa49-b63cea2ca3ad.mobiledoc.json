That’s definitely the case with Havoc, a 1970 Dodge Challenger that’s been bagged and is pushing a monstrous 2500-horsepower. During the American muscle car heyday there was nothing like this, except for that beautiful shape."

The car rides on a Roadster Shop chassis and has airbags, so nobody is going to bottom out unless they’re completely careless. Under the hood is a 572ci all-aluminum Hemi V8 with ProCharger F3R supercharger bolted up. The fact it’s pushing 2500-hp is just ridiculously wonderful."

And while there’s modern tech like LED lighting in the engine compartment and an iPad embedded in the dash, it doesn’t go overboard. After all, there’s still a manual transmission to keep you feeling connected to the machine more intimately than flapping some paddles on the steering wheel."

We don’t need restomod muscle cars getting a bad name from one highly-publicized incident of stupidity and lawmakers salivating as they plot what regulations they’re going to slap on the industry."
