These cars were supplied without paint, the concept being that racers each would apply their own color scheme, so why bother? The HemiCudas, along with their corporate-mate, the Hemi Dart, quickly ruled the dragstrip, with 10-second elapsed times commonplace. With improved tire technology, and years of tuning work, these cars today hover in the low-8-second range, with some topping 160 MPH in the quarter mile, making them today, as in 1968, the quickest-accelerating production cars ever built."
