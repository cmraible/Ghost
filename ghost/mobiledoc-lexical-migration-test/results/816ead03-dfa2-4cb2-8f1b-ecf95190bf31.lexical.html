<p><a href="https://www.ryanfriedmanmotorcars.com/2010-porsche-911-gt3-rs-c-1472/">Modern Porsche</a> has made a name for itself in the automobile industry by improving upon the concepts which made them famous in the first place. Rather than simply riding the coattails of their previous successes, the newer vehicles are focused on constant innovation. This particular vehicle is an example of what Porsche has been able to accomplish over its reign as Germany’s greatest sports car brand. Despite the car having been made in 2010, it still keeps up with today's supercars. So what is it about this Porsche 997.2 GT3 RS that makes it such an impressive performance car for anyone with a taste for German cars?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ryanfriedmanmotorcars.com/2010-porsche-911-gt3-rs-c-1472/">First of all,</a> you have the flat-six Mezger engine, which sits behind the rear axle in true Porsche sports car fashion, this gives the car a unique weight distribution and takes a skilled driver to handle. Spinning tires is an incredibly easy feat for the car as the Porsche sports one of the brand’s best powerhouses. Utilizing 3.8-liters of displacement, this ridiculous flat-six engine can push out a massive 450-horsepower, with components borrowed from the GT3 RSR race car.</p>
