Also, some details on the car don’t look like any other Superbird. You’d be correct on both counts. The history of the Black Ice Superbird is a fascinating one few seem to know."

This car originally was yellow, as indicated by the build sheet. That’s not all the changes made to it, as you can clearly see with the hood."

That’s the sort of move you’d expect from an 80s metal musician, but Ferry didn’t stop there. The man added an Air Grabber fresh air induction system, something not offered by the factory for aerodynamic reasons, making this wing car that much cooler and more intimidating."
