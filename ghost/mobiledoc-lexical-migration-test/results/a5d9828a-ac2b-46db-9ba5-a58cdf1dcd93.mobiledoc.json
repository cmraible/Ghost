According to reports, two police officers were stopped near Linwood and Holmes when they say the Corvette approaching at well beyond the speed limit. The driver then pulled the American sports car into the oncoming lanes of traffic to get around vehicles which were stopped at the intersection, then turned left in the direction of East 31st Street."

We don’t know if the driver of the Corvette spotted the cops and tried to make a run for it or if he was just continuing to drive like he was before, but he plowed the vehicle through a construction zone and into a building. When the officers turned east onto 31st Street that’s when they saw flames at the corner of the intersection."

Instead of going left of the construction zone like the posted signs directed, he went right, jumping the sports car onto the sidewalk, knocking over a traffic signal pole, crashing through a chain link fence, and hitting construction barriers before it caught fire."

Downtown Kansas City can be a confusing maze, so it’s not somewhere you want to speed around, especially if you’re not extremely familiar with all the streets. Add to that the sudden lane changes with the construction zone and it’s no wonder this didn’t end well."
