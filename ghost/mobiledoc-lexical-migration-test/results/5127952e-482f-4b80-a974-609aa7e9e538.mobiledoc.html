<p>Sold by the original owner's wife in 2009, the current owner has put plenty of work into the car. Resprayed in its gorgeous hue of Amazon Green just a decade prior with the hood partially repainted at a later date, this car is in pristine shape. Exterior modifications made by the current owner include European-market bumpers and a set of 16-inch Alpina-style alloy wheels wrapped with Bridgestone Potenza RE760 rubber (205/55 front, 225/50 rear). Also, the side marker lights were removed, and the rocker trim, weatherstripping, headlamps, and grilles have been replaced. In 2016, the motor and seals for the optional factory sunroof were replaced as well. </p>
<p>Powering the car is a M30 3.0-liter inline-six with dual carburetors that is shifted via a Getrag 235 five-speed manual transmission, a replacement of the automatic transmission that it was equipped with off the assembly line. When new, the power rating is 180-horsepower. Stopping power is provided by disc brakes on all four corners, and Bilstein HD dampers were added back in 2009.</p>
<p>Open the doors to reveal an immaculate interior complete with tan leather upholstery and matching carpeting. Interior aesthetics include the black upper dash surfaces with fancy wood trim accents. A Retrosound radio was installed that gives a vintage appearance but is equipped with an auxiliary input that plays your favorite tunes through aftermarket speakers that sit in place of the factory speakers. The current owner repaired the driver's seat, and the horn contact switch on the wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel was replaced in 2016. To keep the cabin cook, the air conditioning system was converted to run on R134a refrigerant. In front of the driver is VDO instrumentation that includes a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer that redlines at 6,500-rpm, a clock, and gauge that monitors both water temperature and fuel.</p>
<p>The current owner rebuilt both carburetors, gave the brake system an overhaul, and replaced the shocks, alternator, clutch, hydraulic cylinders, driveshaft flex disc, and rear main seal. Other recent services include a valve adjustment, new ignition components, and a brake fluid flush. In 2018, both the idle control solenoid and idle control vacuum hose were replaced.</p>
