<p>A <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mazda-rx-7/">Mazda RX-7 FC</a> was recently pulled out of a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-found-in-river/">river in Oregon</a>, which is always a sight to behold. Oftentimes when we cover these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/chevy-silverado-pulled-from-oregon-river/">sunken cars</a>, readers comment how they must have been dumped for insurance fraud. While we don’t always know, because vehicles might be sunk to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/interesting-cars-found-underwater/">cover up other crimes</a>, in this case the team at Adventures With Purpose say this little red RX-7 was indeed submerged in the river to collect insurance money.</p>
<blockquote><em>Check out what happened to an RX-7 these same guys pulled from a river last year <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mazda-rx-7/">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
<p>For Mazda fans this is a super disappointing, maybe even a heartbreaking thing to see. Sure, this isn’t an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/mazda-rx-7-flood/">FD RX-7</a>, which would be completely awful and would make us cry for some time, but it’s still sad to think about how someone took a special car many others would cherish and ruined it just to line their pockets.</p>

<p>Also down in the murky depths of the river is a classic Pontiac Bonneville, or at least that’s what the divers think. They believe it’s been down there since the 60s or 70s, although they didn’t eleborate on why they think that, so we can’t speak to that conclusion at all. Also, it wouldn’t be the first time they’ve guessed wrong on what model a car they’re recovering is, so it might not even be a Pontiac, we don’t know. It’s so disintegrated there’s no pulling that one out, so it’s just going to stay down there.</p>
<p>There’s also what they believe to be a Volkswagen Rabbit in the water. Of course, they thought the FC RX-7 was a Nissan 200ZX, so it could be a New Beetle or a Type 2.</p>

<p>It’s always great to see Adventures With Purpose videos on YouTube. They’re entertaining, interesting, and informative enough to keep you engaged. This one is better than even a lot of their others, but it is on the long end of things at 40 minutes. However, it’s worth the time, because it sure beats watching the junk on TV these days.
