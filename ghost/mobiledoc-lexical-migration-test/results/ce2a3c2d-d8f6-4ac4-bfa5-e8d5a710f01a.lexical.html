<hr>
<p>When Ford reintroduced the Shelby GT350 on the modern S550 platform, enthusiasts went wild over the balanced corner-carver. Not only did they revive the GT350 moniker, but they built an aggressive track-only GT350R Mustang. Here is the chance to take home one incredible Shelby GT350R, but this one is even more special because it is the <em>only</em> yellow car and was built for Shelby American World Championship driver Allen Grant. Not only will one lucky person take home this rare <a href="https://palmspringscruisinassociation.tapkat.org/winallengrantsshelbyGT350?promo=SDIG25">2017 Shelby GT350R Mustang</a>, but they will also learn how to drive the high-performance Mustang during a track day with Allen Grant himself along with some rare original memorabilia. So, go ahead and <a href="https://palmspringscruisinassociation.tapkat.org/winallengrantsshelbyGT350?promo=SDIG25">click here</a> to enter through Palm Springs Cruisin' Association and make a donation to be entered.

<p>Loaded with performance features, the GT350R is powered by a 5.2-liter Ti-VCT Flat Plane Crank V8 engine that generates a healthy 526-horsepower and 429 lb/ft of torque. Stopping all that power is as necessary as launching so big Brembo brakes were installed which are the most powerful brakes in a production Mustang. Drivability and handling stay in check thanks to an advanced suspension that includes the MagneRide damping system.</p>
<p>The inside of Allen's GT350R features Recaro Cloth/Miko suede manual sport seats. Also, the car is equipped with R-Electronics package and has a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system.</p>
