Jump off and glide by following the Time Shards, and then make your way up. As you make your way upwards, you&#8217;ll see a portal on the left-hand side. You can&#8217;t jump up and through it from the bottom, but you can fall into it from above. If you do that, you can head through the top-left corner from some Time Shards and some health. But if you want to continue the story, don&#8217;t worry about that and remain in 16 bit to proceed upwards. This next part is to disable the third shield generator. Now that you&#8217;ve done that, proceed right and keep riding that dragon.</p>\n<p>The fourth section is quite simple, so proceed onwards until you get to this frame&#8230;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2605\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720305000-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"The Messenger Elemental Skylands\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720305000-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720305000-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720305000-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720305000-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>If you head right, you can get a gold coin, but we&#8217;ll settle all that another time. For now, head upwards and you&#8217;ll already be at the fourth shield generator. Take out all the lanterns without dropping into the lava and without being hit by the lava drops.</p>\n<p>After that, proceed through the top-left corner. The rest is all pretty straightforward (albeit with some challenging platforming sections).</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ll be at a boss fight with the Clockwork Concierge! There isn&#8217;t much to this boss fight other than dodging and shooting. <strong>We&#8217;d absolutely recommend using charged shots as they will go through oncoming projectiles and hit the big guy. </strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2606\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720363400-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"The Messenger Elemental Skylands\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720363400-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720363400-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720363400-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018090720363400-0E5FEC5305745886DD7884A0129866BD.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to aim for his head, his canons on his stomach and his backside panel.
