If you think about it, who would have ever thought that a large portion of the remaining cars from the 1970s would have fuel injection, independent suspension, and rack and pinion steering and yet at the same time it is very fitting that a restorer would want to add the best features of the modern world to their favorite "

Judging from the looks of it, this is nothing more than a beautifully restored show quality vintage truck with a classic wood bed, but open the hood or peak underneath and it is clear to see that this truck is so much more than Ford could have imagined it back in the forties."
