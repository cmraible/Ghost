          "Hot Wheels is a brand most notably recognized for its dedication to having fun with the concept of custom classic and modern-day performance automobiles. You might remember racing these cars on tracks as children as those long orange tracks bent and twisted around like a roller coaster in your living room. These tiny vehicles were undoubtedly a source of joy for automotive enthusiasts everywhere, which is precisely why some would go on to build their own Hot Wheel cars as adults. This particular vehicle is an excellent example of how to celebrate your kid-side with your favorite automobile and years of dedication to your craft. "

          "Under the hood of this incredible low-riding masterpiece of automotive creation sits a massive 7.0-liter V8 engine. That monstrous powerhouse is a high output addition to a powertrain fitted perfectly for the gigantic vintage coupe. Spinning the rear wheels of this Buick Riviera is a boastful 360 horsepower and 475 ft/lbs of torque which seems fitting for this wild classic muscle car. All that power is sent through a three-speed automatic transmission which is an excellent option for anyone looking to have some fun at the dragstrip. But, of course, this is not the only good thing we can look forward to seeing in the next round of Hot Wheel's Legends Tour."

This makes the car an excellent choice for any flamboyant automotive enthusiast who likes to have everyone looking their way. So it makes sense that this dedicated builder and owner would compete in an event to choose the next addition to the Hot Wheels catalog. If all goes well, we might see scale models of this 7.0-liter masterpiece in kids' hands everywhere with the Hot Wheels logo emblazoned on its undercarriage. The results should take place in the finalist event, but for now, we'll see how the vehicle does in the semi-finals event."
