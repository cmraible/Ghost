How this even exists is a story of a labor of love which started with one owner and was completed by the next one. Sometimes you just can’t finish a project, maybe due to a lack of money, time, or maybe interest, but we’re sure glad the guy who ended up with this ride is letting others enjoy it while cruising around."

The trim comes from a few different Studebakers, so this thing is cobbled together in a way, but is done so beautifully well, resulting in a tremendous presentation."
