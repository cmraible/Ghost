<p>Get more horsepower with your 2020 Toyota Supra now.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even before the new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-a-toyota-supra-go-from-field-to-amazing/">Toyota Supra</a> came out, people were complaining about its relative lack of power. After all, these days 450 horsepower is the new 300-hp, especially when you have Camry sedans breaking that figure. Granted, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/papadakis-racing-turning-2020-toyota-supra-into-mega-drifter/">BMW-sourced powertrain</a> rockets the Supra from 0-60 much faster than anyone expected, but everyone wants more power. That’s where German tuning output Manhart comes in with a nice lineup of performance parts.</p>

<p>Manhart has a history of tweaking <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bubble-bmw/">Bimmers</a>, so dialing up the new Toyota Supra isn’t much of a leap. The result is the Manhart Supra GR 450. As the name implies, the sports car has 450 PS or 444-hp on tap, but that’s certainly not all there is to it.</p>
<p>To get this kind of power boost you’re going to pony up some serious cash. The Manhart ECU remap for a Supra costs $2,700 but some will think that’s a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/budget-friendly-1988-toyota-supra/">small price</a>. Consider the fact different magazines have been able to clock 0-60 times under 4 seconds – what would an additional 100-plus-hp do?</p>

<p>A bigger issue pointed out by reviewers is the Supra’s sloppy handling. Manhart offers KW coilovers for just shy of $2,000. Not only do these tighten everything up at the four corners, the car is lowered a little bit for improved handling and arguably a better presentation. Other coilover kits and even H&R Sport springs are available at different prices.</p>
<p>Everyone knows with turbocharged cars freeing up the exhale can really help. Manhart has a few different exhaust upgrades, like a downpipe and an axle-back system with valve control. Check out how it sounds in the video below.</p>

<p>Also in the Manhart arsenal are a few electronics from an ECM valve control to an ECM valve delete. A decal set costing about $900 looks cool and some probably believe it adds 30% more horsepower. If you really want to go large, the tuner offers two different types of wheels for the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">car</a>, which will set you back in the neighborhood of $3,000.</p>
<p>The real question is if any of these Manhart upgrades change your perception of the new <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Toyota/Supra">Toyota Supra</a>? Would you be more likely to buy one knowing you can slap down even more cash to mod it out?</p>
