The car was more akin to the Ford probe, which was scheduled to replace the Mustang, while the Mustang concept was RWD and had a V8 the exterior styling was soft and round. While the Jenner concept 'Stang didn't even look like a sports car much less a muscle car, our next entry takes “aggressive” to another level. This was the Rambo design, sharp aggressive lines drew the eye to the fang-like grill under a ram-air hood to give the appearance of a snake. However, the Mustang is a horse, not a snake so this design was also scrapped."
