<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Just a quick note to show you how your support for <em>The Daily Poster</em> is having a huge impact in the debate on Capitol Hill right now.</p>
<p>Last night, NBC’s network featured our follow-the-money reporting in a must-watch segment.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dailyposter/status/1445559997421608965?s=20">Click here to watch the clip</a>. As you’ll see, the segment begins with our original exclusive reporting on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">Senator Kyrsten Sinema being bankrolled by Big Pharma</a>, and ends with our reporting on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/follow-the-pharma-money/">three pharma-bankrolled House Democrats</a> trying to kill drug pricing legislation.</p>

<p>Our reporting is intensifying pressure on corporate Democrats and being <a href="https://twitter.com/CopperCourier/status/1445796610529583108?s=20">featured in the local Arizona press</a>. One lawmaker recently <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1444001859480469519">said our journalism is making a major impact</a> in the debate on Capitol Hill.</p>
