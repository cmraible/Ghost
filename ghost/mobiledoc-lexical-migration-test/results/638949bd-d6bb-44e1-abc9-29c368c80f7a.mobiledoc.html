<p>Collected by Mr. Palmen, the man had extensive knowledge of European classics, using that to amass an impressive collection of rarities. He stashed the vehicles in three locations: a church and two warehouses. Showing the classics off to few, almost nobody knew about this stash until recently.</p>
<p>Obviously, the term “barn find” is being used rather liberally here, something that’s become quite common lately. We know some people really hate that fact and we understand why. After all, none of these cars look like they’ve been stored in some dusty barn for four decades. Sure, there’s a little bit of dust and maybe some patina, but overall they look to be in fantastic shape.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, these are being called a barn find to get people excited. And it seems to be working. Call it an act of marketing or whatever else, the people who are promoting this auction have a job to do and they’re getting it done. There does seem to be increasing interest around the auction and it’s easy to see why.</p>
