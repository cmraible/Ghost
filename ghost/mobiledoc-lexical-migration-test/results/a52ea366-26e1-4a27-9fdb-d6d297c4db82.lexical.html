<p>This gorgeous <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/214447/1971-dodge-challenger-r-t">1971 Dodge Challenger R/T</a> is painted in the eye-catching shade of Plum Crazy. It's an attention-getting metallic purple that was just one of many wild colors being offered on Mopar machines at the height of the muscle car era.</p>
<p>These colors had names like Go ManGo, Lime Light, and Top Banana. If the bright colors didn't grab your attention, the aggressive styling did. This Challenger features the tall "Go Wing" on the trunk, as well as an aggressive front spoiler, hood pins, and hood scoops with engine callout emblems.</p>

<p>Those callouts denote the presence of a massive 440 cubic inch Magnum V8 stuffed between the purple fenders. In 1971, this potent powerplant was rated at 370 horsepower and 480 lb/ft of torque. Those are some serious numbers.</p>
<p>Inside, you'll find white vinyl bucket seats, a Tuff wheel, and a pistol grip shifter for the four speed manual transmission. If nothing else, you have to admit that these classic Mopar muscle cars oozed attitude from every gap in the sheetmetal.</p>
