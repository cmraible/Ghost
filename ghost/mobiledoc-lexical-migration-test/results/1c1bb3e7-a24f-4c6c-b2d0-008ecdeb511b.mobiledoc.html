<p>As we have repeatedly reported, Big Pharma has been funneling money to key corporate Democratic lawmakers who are doing the pharmaceutical industry’s bidding and working to water down the party’s drug pricing plan. But new campaign disclosures reveal the drug business’ influence-peddlers aren’t just funneling money to the individual lawmakers — they are also bankrolling core party infrastructure.</p>

<p>“This we know: The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.” — Chief Seattle of the Duwamish and Suquamish</p>

<h3 id="today%E2%80%99s-stat">TODAY’S STAT:</h3>
<p>Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) <strong>lost a full third of the vote total</strong> President Joe Biden won in the state in 2020. According to the Virginia department of elections, McAuliffe won 1.6 million votes in <a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2021%20November%20General/Site/Statewide.html">2021</a>, while 2.4 million Virginians voted for Biden <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:2020/year_to:2020/office_id:1">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Fewer people typically vote in non-presidential year election cycles. However, Republican winner and private equity mogul Glenn Youngkin only saw a 300,000 vote drop-off from former President Donald Trump last year.</p>

<p>The chairman of a firm that lobbies for Big Pharma raised almost $200,000 for House Democrats’ campaign arm in October, while party lawmakers were busy watering down their drug pricing plan and considering dropping it from their Build Back Better agenda bill altogether.</p>
<p>The new disclosure from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) shows that the drug industry’s influence-peddlers haven’t only been <a href="__GHOST_URL__/big-pharmas-reward/">funnelling</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/the-pharma-bait-and-switch/">money</a> to the individual lawmakers openly doing Big Pharma’s bidding in negotiations over Democrats’ reconciliation legislation — they are also bankrolling core party infrastructure. The principal mission of the DCCC, after all, is to support and elect House Democratic candidates.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p>Last week, the DCCC reported that Vincent Roberti, Jr. <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/496/202111199468625496/202111199468625496.pdf">collected</a> more than $190,000 worth of contribution checks for the committee in October. Roberti is the <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202007099244398918">chairman</a> of Roberti Global, which <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/9f066212-8282-44fe-99fe-97c9aead3bb0/print/">registered</a> in May to lobby for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the powerful Washington drug lobbying group. The firm recently disclosed <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e6f201ba-98ec-4edb-8c29-9b8bcc52233c/print/">lobbying</a> for PhRMA on “issues related to H.R. 3,” the legislation that Democrats’ drug pricing plan was modeled on.</p>
<p>Roberti Global’s other clients include drugmakers Pfizer, Amgen, Ardelyx, and Astellas Pharma, as well as the drug distribution giant AmerisourceBergen Corporation. The firm also does work for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, another lobbying group for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>On November 20, 1969, 89 Indigenous student leaders from universities across California <a href="https://twitter.com/DrRupaMarya/status/1462379626873774084/photo/1">took over Alcatraz Island</a> under the unifying banner of “Indians of All Tribes.” Their 19-month occupation resulted in then-President Richard Nixon’s administration repealing detrimental termination and relocation policies that aimed for full assimilation, and political and cultural erasure, of Indigenous people. The Occupation of Alcatraz also helped catalyze the <a href="https://socialistworker.org/2018/08/08/1968-the-rise-of-the-red-power-movement">Red Power movement</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

    <li><strong>JOE BIDEN’S PRIVATE EQUITY VACATION:</strong> President Joe Biden and his family <a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1463281449243754505">will celebrate Thanksgiving</a> at the Nantucket, Massachusetts, vacation home of David Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder of the Washington private equity giant Carlyle Group. Carlyle has been <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/1f273b94-2dbe-47cb-8c12-6de3da9ccd25/print/">lobbying</a> on Biden’s Build Back Better reconciliation legislation, and <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1463306899114315782">belongs</a> to corporate lobbying groups that <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/economy/u-s-chamber-launches-new-wave-of-advocacy-against-reconciliation-bill">have</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/big-companies-are-funding-campaign-kill-climate-bill/620278/">campaigned</a> against the bill. The White House <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_wingrove/status/1463300447507202055">said</a> the Bidens will “stay at the home of their friend, David Rubenstein, as they have done previously.”</li>
    <li><strong>“THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL”:</strong> A local newspaper asked Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., about the Big Pharma front group Center Forward’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/sinema-threat-followed-boost-from-pharma-group/">campaign</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/pharma-front-group-has-spent-1-2-million-backing-sinema/">promoting</a> her as she worked to weaken Democrats’ drug pricing legislation — a story broken by <em>The Daily Poster</em>. Sinema <a href="http://www.redrocknews.com/2021/11/19/u-s-sen-kyrsten-sinema-answers-questions-in-one-on-one-interview-in-sedona/">told the <em>Sedona Red Rock News</em></a> she has no influence over outside groups’ spending, “because that would be illegal.” Center Forward has long been funded by the powerful drug lobby PhRMA. Asked about PhRMA’s lobbying on the drug pricing bill, Sinema said, “What I can’t do is speak to what an outside group is doing because I have no idea.”</li>

    <li><strong>SOUTHERN WHITE MIGRATION HELPS EXPLAIN TODAY’S POLARIZATION: </strong>New research identifies the outsized role the Great Migration of Southern whites in the 20th century may have played in shaping the United States’ current socio-cultural polarization. The <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29506">paper</a>, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, offers a new perspective on how Southern white migrants have transformed politics and culture across America. “Southern white migrants brought with them a set of preferences and beliefs, characterized by racial animus, conservative religious attitudes, and localist values that would underpin their right-wing political leanings in the decades to come,” noted the study’s authors.</li>
