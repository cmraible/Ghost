<p>Forget the fact I didn’t attend and haven’t written one story about CES this year, I still somehow managed to be on the press list so I’ve been getting a bunch of pitches. Anyway, all of them have been pretty much the same old stuff you would expect to receive — that is, until today when I received this magnificent <em>thing</em> in my inbox. I present the best worst CES pitch of 2016.</p>
<p>I have no speech.</p>

<p>I’m all for keeping it short and sweet, but I have no idea what “this story” is — and for the record, I didn’t open the press release. I hate press releases. I loathe them. Despise them.</p>
