          "If you’ve been paying attention to the news at all in the past three years, you already know car thefts have increased sharply. Many in the media and government initially tried to pin the crime surge entirely on the pandemic, however that has fallen apart. Now, people are facing the fact that car thefts are being fueled by a soft attitude toward it and other crimes. That’s helping change things, including a bill in Michigan which would make it a felony to be in possession of car key programming technology with the intent to steal vehicles."

Instead of just a slap on the wrist and the guys who are boosting cars being back on the streets in no time, they would be facing up to 10 years in prison for the possession charge."

However, they like to hit other muscle cars, luxury vehicles, and anything else they either think will sell for good money in the black market or will make for a fun getaway car. The problem is especially bad in Detroit and other big cities, but it’s been migrating at increasing rates to more rural communities."
