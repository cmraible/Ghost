Vaughn is known for her unmistakable image and equally as alluring personality, even all these years later.</p>

<blockquote>“I’ve loved all of my Hurst Olds,” 2019 MSHFA inductee Vaughn said. “And I love that Bruce Smith and I were able to make sure one of them has a permanent home at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.”</blockquote>

<p>Miss Hurst first grabbed people’s attention when she would ride on a replica 1969 Olds 442 Hurst Shifter convertible, sharing her platform with a nine-foot high golden shifter, during racing events. That iconic Olds actually sold back in 2014 for $200K, with proceeds going to cancer research.</p>
<blockquote>Before the donation, made by Linda Vaughn, and New York muscle car collector Bruce Smith, the duo took a trip pacing Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade in Ponce Inlet, Florida last month. They were in a Hurst/Olds, a 1972 Indianapolis 500 pace car at the time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’re so grateful to Bruce Smith and Linda Vaughn for this terrific addition to the MSHFA stable,” said Hall of Fame President George Levy. “Linda is beloved by racing fans the world over and visitors to our museum will appreciate seeing her personal car for years to come.”</blockquote>
