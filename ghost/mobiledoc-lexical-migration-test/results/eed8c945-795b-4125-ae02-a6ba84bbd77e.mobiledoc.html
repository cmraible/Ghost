<p>Now that Congress has passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes both historic climate spending and new fossil fuel development, we‚Äôre asking the question, ‚ÄúWhere does the climate movement go from here?‚Äù On the latest episode of our weekly Callin show, <a href="https://www.callin.com/show/lever-live-LcswzmQmIX"><em>Lever Live</em></a><em>, </em>David Sirota was joined by special guest <a href="https://twitter.com/KateAronoff">Kate Aronoff</a> to discuss the bill‚Äôs provisions, their potential impacts, and the reaction from climate activists. As always, we took questions from the audience LIVE on air. </p>
<p><em><strong>Lever Live </strong></em><strong>is publicly available for anyone to listen to and participate in. Just click this link to find tonight‚Äôs show on Callin.</strong></p>

<p>We asked audience members to call in and give us their on-air takes about some big questions:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Will the bill actually reduce emissions?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ How will renewable energy development be implemented?</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ What are climate activists saying about the bill?</p>
