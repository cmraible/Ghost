<p>The group argues that the movieâ€™s plot is essentially a pro-capitalist psychological thriller about a woman who is manipulated and subdued by her corporate oppressor.

They also insist that the male lead is a full-blown psychopath whose only redeemable quality is that heâ€™s played by Tom Hanks.</p>
