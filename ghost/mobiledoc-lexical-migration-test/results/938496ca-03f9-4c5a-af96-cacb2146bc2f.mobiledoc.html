<hr>
<p>The <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2021-ford-bronco-reveal/">Ford </a>F-Series was first introduced in 1948, and since 1977, it has stood as the best-selling <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/trucks/">pickup truck</a> sold in the U.S. A total of fourteen generations of F-Series trucks have been offered over the last 73 years, and the latest is the all-new 2021 Ford F-150. To welcome this newest F-150, which promises to be the most featured-filled and technologically advanced truck ever, we take a quick look back at the evolution of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/classic/">classic </a>Ford F-Series lineup â€“ specifically, the first nine generations.</p>
<h3 id="first-generation-1948-1952-">First Generation (1948-1952)</h3>

<p>Pickup trucks have always been a popular niche among classic car enthusiasts, and this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/192122/1951-ford-f-1">1951 Ford F-1</a> is an excellent example of why. The long, rounded rood and those shapely fenders create a design that looks great whether the truck is a bone-stock farm truck or a heavily custom build. These trucks were built from 1948 until 1952 with models ranging from the half-ton F-1 up to F-8 heavy-duty applications.</p>
<h3 id="second-generation-1953-1956-">Second Generation (1953-1956)</h3>

<p>Ford refined the design of its pickup truck in 1952 for the truck's second generation, which is also when a more familiar naming scheme was introduced with models like the F-100, F-250 and F-350. This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/175858/1956-ford-f1">1956 Ford F-100</a> represents the final year for this generation, and it's easily recognizable with its squared-off cab line and vertical A-pillars.</p>
<h3 id="third-generation-1957-1960-">Third Generation (1957-1960)</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1957-ford-f100-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="670" height="447" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1957-ford-f100-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1957-ford-f100-1.jpg 670w">

<p>This heavily customized <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/170652/1957-ford-f100">1957 Ford F-100</a><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ebay-gasser-build/">gasser</a> is an example of the third-generation F-Series that was around until 1960. This design is noted not only for ditching the wide front fenders in favor of a boxier look, but this generation was the first time Ford offered the F-Series with a factory 4x4 option.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-generation-1961-1966-">Fourth Generation (1961-1966)</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1963-ford-f100-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="670" height="503" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1963-ford-f100-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1963-ford-f100-1.jpg 670w">

<p>As truck design started to get bolder, the fourth-generation F-Series began to push the limits of style. As you can see from this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/197994/1963-ford-f100">1963 Ford F-100</a>, these trucks had a sleeker, smoother look, and while Ford experimented with the idea of a unibody pickup truck, this model was eventually dropped in 1963. This generation marked the first time Ford used the "Ranger" name starting as a trim level on the F-150 and later as a separate model on the compact pickup truck.</p>
<h3 id="fifth-generation-1967-1972-">Fifth Generation (1967-1972)</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1971-ford-f100-4x4-pickup-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="670" height="447" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1971-ford-f100-4x4-pickup-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1971-ford-f100-4x4-pickup-1.jpg 670w">

<p>Ford's fifth-generation F-Series ran from 1967 until 1972, and this body style incorporated even more of a focus on design. This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/180328/1971-ford-f100-4x4-pickup">1971 Ford F-100 4x4</a> might be one of the nicest from this body style that you'll find thanks to an extensive frame-off restoration.</p>
<h3 id="sixth-generation-1973-1979-">Sixth Generation (1973-1979)</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1977-ford-f150-ranger-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="670" height="446" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1977-ford-f150-ranger-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1977-ford-f150-ranger-1.jpg 670w">

<p>The sixth-generation F-Series marks a special place in this truck's history. Not only did it introduce the F-150 name, but in 1977, the F-Series also became the best-selling truck in the U.S.; and it's held that title ever since. In terms of design, this generation was the last for the truck's clamshell hood, and this <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/194774/1977-ford-f150-ranger">1977 Ford F-150 Ranger</a> is a good-looking example of a sixth-gen F-Series.</p>
<h3 id="seventh-generation-1980-1986-">Seventh Generation (1980-1986)</h3>

<p>Late-model trucks are starting to get some love among car collectors (like an <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/bidding-war-erupts-1985-chevy-truck/">$85,000 1985 Chevrolet K20</a>), so don't be surprised when trucks like this well-preserved <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/197027/1982-ford-f150">1982 Ford F-150 Lariat 4x4</a> continue to rise in value. This was the first generation of Ford trucks to feature the Blue Oval badge in the front grille.</p>
<h3 id="eight-generation-1987-1991-">Eight Generation (1987-1991)</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1991-ford-f-150-xlt-lariat-4x4-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="670" height="447" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1991-ford-f-150-xlt-lariat-4x4-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1991-ford-f-150-xlt-lariat-4x4-1.jpg 670w">

<p>In 1987, Ford evolved the look of the F-150 to have a more aerodynamic front end highlighted by the wraparound turn signals instead of the previous stacked design. This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/195329/1991-ford-f-150-xlt-lariat-4x4">1991 Ford F-150 XLT Lariat</a> marked the last year for the eight-generation F-Series, and this truck is a super-clean example.</p>
<h3 id="ninth-generation-1992-1997-">Ninth Generation (1992-1997)</h3>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1995-ford-f-150-eddie-bauer-edition-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="670" height="447" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1995-ford-f-150-eddie-bauer-edition-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/06/1995-ford-f-150-eddie-bauer-edition-1.jpg 670w">

</figure>
<p>The ninth-generation Ford F-Series was yet another evolution of the seventh-gen design, and it might be considered one of the last of the true classic trucks. When this generation ended in 1997, it represented the final year that the light-duty and heavy-duty F-Series trucks shared a body, and it was also the generation that introduced the SVT Lightning performance truck. This <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/192191/1995-ford-f-150-eddie-bauer-edition">1995 Ford F-150 Eddie Bauer Edition</a> is a super clean example of the 1992-97 F-Series trucks.</p>

<p>From 1998 through 2020, there were four generations of the F-Series, and the all-new 2021 F-150 will be the most advanced version ever offering an on-board generator as well as hybrid and electric models.</p>
