Other touches that helped inspire the hotrod movement include the exposed V8 engine, the use of drop axles and the removal of the fenders and running boards. As restrained as this car looks compared to hotrods that came after it, this Ford is incredibly custom right down windshield that was fabricated from the rear window of a Chrysler."

The legend behind the hotrod states that after filming, Elvis tried on several occasions to purchase it, and each time Athan refused. Athan had the Ford restored in 1998, and he kept it until he died 2016. After his death, his family kept the car until 2019. Due to its involvement in movie, music and automotive culture, Athan's custom 1929/32 Ford Roadster has been on display at the Smithsonian Museum, Wally Parks NHRA Museum and the Petersen Museum."
