Being a lawyer Rick Patel, one of the owners, has driven this prized performance car to and from work, to the courthouse, and also takes the car out for a drive whenever the urge presents itself. Originally the car was purchased by Rick and his brother and is fully enjoyed by both families to this day. The Deep Blue roadster captures the eye of many Corvette fans young and old alike with the timeless, yet classic, styling and quick, for the time, 0-60 of just 6.4 seconds."
