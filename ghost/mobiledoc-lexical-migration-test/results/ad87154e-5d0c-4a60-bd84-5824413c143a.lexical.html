<p>In a move that feels <em>incredibly</em> on-brand, left wing politics and news site <em>The Canary</em>’s editorial team have executed a coup, and taken over the title as a worker’s cooperative. From <a href="https://www.thecanary.co/feature/2022/10/03/for-the-first-time-ever-the-canary-is-under-workers-control/">their post announcing the move</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The reason we’re still here is because we all believe in the need for a radical media that isn’t afraid to speak truth to power, amplify the voices of the oppressed, and envision a world beyond capitalism and the state. However, radical media needs to be a microcosm of the world in which we want to live. It needs to be worker-run and truly democratic.</blockquote>

<p>They’ve run a series of posts examining the problems within their own organisation under the previous management which led to this move. <a href="https://www.thecanary.co/featured/2022/10/03/weve-had-to-investigate-the-canarys-own-toxic-environment/">Some allegations</a> are, well, eyebrow-raising:</p>
<blockquote>Not only was the Canary being run as a corporate capitalist entity with directors receiving far more in wages and benefits than other staff members, it was also being done incompetently, with potentially multiple breaches of companies law.</blockquote>
<p>How did that management failure manifest? As <em>Press Gazette</em>’s Bron Maher <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/canary-staff-overthrow-directors-co-op/">reported this morning</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The 15 staff now in control of the business say they have been left owing “tens of thousands of pounds in unpaid VAT” and £14,000 in employer’s national insurance payment liabilities.</blockquote>

<p>So, how does a workers’ cooperative manage a news title?</p>
<blockquote>Because we’re registered as a cooperative within UK law, our primary rules need to be written in a certain way, and meet certain criteria. However, we want the way we operate in practice to mirror a deeper radicalism and militancy. As such, the way that the Canary operates as a co-op – and a sociocracy – will be an unfolding process defined by the decisions we make day to day as a collective. We will work hard to ensure that what we create is an empowering expression of our collective vision.</blockquote>
<p>What, you may ask, is a sociocracy? <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/content/">Here’s a definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Sociocracy combines consent decision-making, a decentralized system of authority and intentional processes to improve our decisions and processes over time into a governance system that supports effective and efficient process while increasing connection, listening and co-creation among members.</blockquote>
<p>And here’s a video explainer:</p>

<p>It’s one of a new breed of corporate management styles that eschew traditional hierarchies for other organising principles. For example, there’s also <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/explore">holocracy</a>, which was really popular about a decade ago.</p>

<p>Will this work? I have no idea. For this to work, they need to marry their internal reorganisation with a business model — presumably a better-run version of their existing membership approach — to deliver something that’s sustainable. That’s no easy task, especially with debts from the former management hanging over them.</p>
<p>But it’s interesting to see a media outlet adopting a management and ownership style that reflect its political ethos. And, even if you don’t share the site’s politics, it’s hard not to be excited by a brave and public move like this.</p>
<p>More power to them.</p>
