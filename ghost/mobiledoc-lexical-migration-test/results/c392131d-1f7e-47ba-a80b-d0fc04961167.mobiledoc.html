<p>As rare as it is to be able to acquire a used second-gen Ford GT,  Ford made sure that buying one of these supercars brand new was an  ultra-exclusive affair; after all, only 1,350 of Ford GTs are being  built over six model years. Fortunately for Brad Keselowski, being one  of the top Ford drivers in NASCAR has its advantages, and he made the cut to buy one of  just 138 of the GTs that were built for the car's first model year, and  now the NASCAR champion is selling his 2017 Ford GT '66 Heritage Edition through RK Motors.</p>
