<p>Watching new race cars zip around a track can be fascinating, mostly because of technology, but also boring for the same reason and possibly more. That’s why if you’re really looking for some excitement you should watch some <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/rolex-monterey-motorsports-reunion/">vintage races</a>, like the video posted below. This is from last fall’s Sonoma Speed Festival and features historic Trans Am <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/restored-1985-march-85g-gtp-acecar/">race cars</a> from 1966 to 1972.</p>
<p>Obviously, historic races are a great way to see some of your favorite classics up close. Sure, you can go to a car show or attend other events, but you might not see many or any racers there, like these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/trans-am-sebring/">Trans Am cars</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more, you get to see these <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">American muscle</a> machines that are half a century old go wheel-to-wheel around one of the more challenging tracks in the US: Sonoma Raceway. There’s a lot on the line with a crash in NASCAR, but when the vehicles navigating the tricky turn are historically significant it really ups the ante.</p>
<p>Crank the sound up and listen to the V8s rumble! Tell me that doesn’t sound better than most racing today. These cars, which include Chevrolet Camaros, AMC Javelins, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Ford/Mustang%20Boss%20302">Ford Mustang Boss 302s</a>, Ford Mustangs, Dodge Challengers, etc. It’s quite the show and worthy of your time watching.</p>

<p>As long as we’re all allowed to actually live life once more come the fall, you can go to the 2020 Sonoma Speed Festival and see the <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">cars</a> live. Of course, things are looking a little grim since the <a href="https://www.sonomaspeedfestival.com/">event’s webpage</a> won’t load at the writing of this article, but here’s to hoping it’s just a temporary technical glitch and nothing more.</p>
<p>The action is supposed to commence September 4 and go through September 6 at Sonoma Raceway, of course. Once the website is up and running again, you’ll be able to buy tickets in advance. Then you can see all kinds of vintage cars take on the notorious turns in northern California, including purpose-built American muscle.</p>
