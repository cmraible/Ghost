<hr>
<p>We've seen the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/2020-chevrolet-corvette-instant-collectible/">C8 Corvette</a> drag race a lot of cars this year including a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-shelby-gt500-drag-race/">2020 Shelby GT500</a>, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/tuned-c8-corvette-race-stock-lamborghini/">Lamborghini Huracán</a> and even a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/corvette-c8-c7-race/">C7 Corvette</a>, and now it's time to see the mid-engine sports car go up against the reigning horsepower champion, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-challenger-demon-parts/">Dodge Challenger Demon</a>. Some of those previous races pitted a slightly tuned <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/wrecked-c8-corvette-junkyard-auction/">Corvette </a>up against a stock rival, but this race shows how a stock 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Z51 handles a stock 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon.</p>

<p>This race is a good look at the physics of racing showing how power and weight play into a car's performance. The one-year-only Challenger Demon weighs in at 4,300 pounds while offering up 840 horsepower on racing fuel; this race featured a tank of pump gas for the Demon resulting in a max output of <em>just </em>808 horsepower. As far as the C8 Corvette goes, these cars weigh in closer to 3,600 pounds, and the Z51 package returns an output of 495 horsepower – a five hp jump over the base 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.</p>
<p>There's plenty of information about both cars in the video, but if you're just here to see the racing, then you'll want to jump ahead to where the action starts at the 3:50 mark seeing the two cars go head-to-head in a straight-up drag race followed by a 40-mph roll. </p>
<p>Just like we saw from the C8 racing the Shelby, the Corvette has a noticeable weight and traction advantage off the line from a dead start allowing the underpowered 'Vette to prevent the Demon from having any chance. But from a 40-mph rolling start, the Corvette's traction advantage is negated and the Demon pulls away for an easy win.</p>
