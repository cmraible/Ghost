It retains that proud hood and the model’s flared wheel arches, and leaves the coupe profile as intended. The first hint that not all is as it seem comes from those red wheels and a squatted ride hight."

Lift the hood to reveal a 5.7-liter LS1 V8 motor of an unspecified output, courtesy of rival General Motors. We’re willing to bet that this classic’s new heart gives it an impressive power-to-weight ratio."
