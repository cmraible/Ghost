          "Imagine finding your dream car when it was considered \"just a used car\". That is precisely what the current owner if this original, factory documented 4spd, HEMI Superbird did when he purchased it in 1982 from the original owner. This was ordered new in Texas as a Chrysler Executive car. When the executive received a new car in 1971, Chrysler made the car available through the Race Car Driver's Program. As prices for genuine 4-speed manual shift HEMI Superbirds have climbed into the stratosphere, it is rare to find one that is still driven and enjoyed every car show season."
