The man is also selling off this Mercedes SL65 AMG Black Series, which he actually helped develop using the Nurburgring Nordschleife 13 years ago. That, apparently, proves this isn’t about F1 politics or making a statement of any sort, but instead is just Wolff clearing out what he doesn’t want, or something of that nature. Honestly, it’s a little perplexing he’s ditching an amazing supercar he had a hand in developing, but apparently he gets more joy out of the other rides in his garage. It’s worth noting the SL65 AMG Black Series only has 3,204 miles on the clock, which is more than any other ride he’s selling, so at least there’s that."
