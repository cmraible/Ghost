The cost of genuine parts has risen sharply in recent years, and buying pattern items tends to be a false economy while used components are also scarce. Serious structural faults are becoming common, while major items that never used to fail, are now beginning to need urgent attention – things like diffs, engines, gearboxes, and driveshafts."

When new it was much more costly than the saloon, and classic values now reflect this – and so do restoration costs. The key is to buy on condition rather than specification as rebuilds are very expensive."

With taller gear ratios, cruising is more relaxed and economy is better too. Collectors want 280s, diesels and 200s are generally shunned while the 230 and 230E provides a good usable classic that’s reasonably perky but not too thirsty."
