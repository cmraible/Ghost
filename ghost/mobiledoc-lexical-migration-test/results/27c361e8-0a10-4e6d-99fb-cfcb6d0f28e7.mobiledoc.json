          "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, the car with the movie named after it, was first seen on the big screen by the public in the late 1960s. It was a movie my grandma took my mom to see, I watched on VHS, and my son enjoyed on DVD. It is a charming and interesting movie about an eccentric inventor, his kids, his female companion, and the biggest star, the custom former race car he brought back from the brink of being scraped."

          "  Caractacus Potts came up with for the vehicle in the cult classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Starring Dick Van Dyke and based on the same titled novel, the imagination it took to create the car took some serious creativity. The challenges of the role for the car would take six different iterations, with only one actually running and the rest were movie props, used in different ways as the car went through all terrains, including the air."
