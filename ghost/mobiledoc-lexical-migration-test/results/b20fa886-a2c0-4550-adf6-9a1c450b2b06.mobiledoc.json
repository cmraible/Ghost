          "Michael Jordan recently celebrated his 59th birthday, and is still considered to be the best NBA player of all time. Although he’s been retired for many years, he is still the first person who will pop into your mind at the mention of basketball legends - he wasn’t too bad at baseball or acting either! If you were alive in the 80s and 90s, you saw Jordan everywhere, he was a branding genius, on top of being one of the most highly skilled athletes in the world. So what did all that success afford him car wise? We’re actually really digging the collection of cars he has acquired over the years, let’s check it out."
