          " is offering one at auction right now. This particular example being offered out of Connecticut is finished Polaris Silver Metallic with the iconic BMW Motorsports graphics. After being imported to the U.S. in 1986 it was gradually restored over the years. In 2014, a major mechanical overhaul totaling nearly $40k was completed by Korman Autoworks of North Carolina but the 5-digit odometer only shows 98k kilometers (61k miles). Most of those miles were reported to be added before the mechanical restoration and the car has supposedly spent the majority of the past three years in climate-controlled storage."

Refinishing was expertly handled in the car's original color. New rubber seals, many trim pieces and moldings, and the exterior decals were all installed. To date, this restoration stands strong. Aside from a small blemish on the passenger side, the paint shows well and everything is in working order. Accompanying the car is an extensive compilation of service records and historical documentation dating back to the 1970s and a clean title. For more information "
