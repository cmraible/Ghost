We’re on the opinion that if you have a nice classic car and you want immaculate paint and bodywork done, you’ll need to shell out some serious money if you don’t have the know-how and tools to do it yourself. A prime example of this unfortunate truth comes via a man in Tennessee who’s hopping mad about the quality of the paint MAACO applied to his 1960 Cadillac Fleetwood."

Then in July of that year the shop reopened under new management, who told the guy they wouldn’t repaint his car again. The owner of the Cadillac said he called MAACO’s corporate office and was informed the warranty would only be honored if the paint was cracking or peeling. Apparently, they feel bubbling isn’t a sign of shoddy workmanship?"
