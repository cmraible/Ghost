<p>Whether a movie simply features a lone chase scene or, like the <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/paul-walkers-toyota-supra/">Fast and Furious</a></em> movies, is built around extensive automotive maneuvers, chances are things are not going to go exactly as planned. One report based on the research of British insurance firm Insure the Gap estimated that the <em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/1970-chevelle-fast-furious/">Fast and Furious</a></em> franchise has killed around 1,800 cars.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the stunt teams for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/quarantine-car-movies/">movies</a> such as these are generally pretty good about not destroying good cars and most of the cars that they do damage beyond repair were destined for the scrapyard anyway. For the glamour shots, though, they do usually build one or two cars to lock in that connection from the car community. Those cars are sometimes kept by people that work on the films or shown at car shows but sometimes they are sold off. That’s when people like Shawn Davis’ friend Jamie get the opportunity to own a jaw dropping stunt double like this 1970 Plymouth <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/barn-find-1969-road-runner/">Road Runner</a>.</p>
<p>The gray <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/every-color-1969-road-runner/">Road Runner</a> features a custom made fiberglass hood covering a massive Keith Black 497-cid HEMI engine with a Tremec 5-speed manual transmission backing. To control all that power, Jamie implemented a Wilwood hydroboost 6-piston brake system.  On the dyno, this equates to 763-horsepower and 800 lbs-ft of torque, without boost or power adders of any kind. Forgeline’s three-piece titanium finish wheels fill the wheel wells and match the design of the car nicely. Reilly Motorsports built the suspension for the car and though it is a very track worthy setup, it really handles the road well.</p>
<p>The trunk holds the fuel cell, battery, and a toolbox in a very unique way. A creativity that is apparent in the interior of the car as well. Simple and purposeful. This is a true driver's car.</p>
