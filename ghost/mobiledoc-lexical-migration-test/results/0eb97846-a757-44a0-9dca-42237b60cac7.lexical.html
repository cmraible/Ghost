<p><a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/jeep?promo=MOTORIOUS28">This Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392</a> is rewriting the rules of what it means to be an off-road cruiser. Many will say that a Jeep can’t be a muscle car, but this challenges those notions with a hefty 470/470 split from the Hemi engine. This engine is basically the same one that powers the Dodge Challenger Scat Packs and the Dodge Charger Scat Packs, but you get a lot more ground clearance, and some would say, a lot more utility.</p>
