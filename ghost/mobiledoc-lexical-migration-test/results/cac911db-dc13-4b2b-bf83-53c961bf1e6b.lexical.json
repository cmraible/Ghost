Pokémon went through a lot of changes, and it took series creator Satoshi Tajiri years of hard work and dedication to see it all come to life. Here&#8217;s the story of how it all happened&#8230;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspiration</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born August 8, 1965, Satoshi Tajiri (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">田尻 智)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grew up in Machida, Tokyo. His father was a Nissan Salesman and his mother was a stay-at-home mom. When Tajiri was a child, Machida was a rural area that had forests, lakes and natural environments for him to explore. In an interview with </span><a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tajiri said that he would spend his early years catching and studying insects, so much so that other kids would call him ‘Dr. Bug’. He even wanted to become an entomologist, however construction of shopping malls and apartment buildings stripped away a lot of the nature that he had loved to explore.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;As a child, I wanted to be an entomologist. Insects fascinated me. Every new insect was a wonderful mystery. And as I searched for more, I would find more. If I put my hand in a river, I would get a crayfish. Put a stick underwater and make a hole, look for bubbles and there were more creatures.&#8221;</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Satoshi Tajiri</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his hometown becoming less green with each passing day, bugs migrated away from Machida and Satoshi Tajiri shifted his love to video games and arcades. He would study the strategies and mechanics of his favorite video games, and he even took apart his Nintendo Famicom just to see how it all worked. He loved video games so much that he would often skip school in order to play at the local arcade. Tajiri often found it difficult to concentrate during school, and his teachers thought that he was just being lazy. It wasn’t until later that doctors discovered that the young Tajiri was autistic, which explained his compulsive behaviour for bugs and video games, as well as his lack of interest in school. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2263\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2263\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2263\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Machida.jpg?resize=768%2C432\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Machida Tokyo\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Machida.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Machida.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2263\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yakushiike Park in Machida, Tokyo</p></div></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, Tajiri skipped school so much that he did not receive enough credits in order to graduate, and was forced to take make-up courses. He eventually graduated and later enrolled at the Tokyo National College of Technology studying electronics and computer science, but dropped out after just two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up, Satoshi Tajiri was engrossed in the growing anime and manga culture. Tajiri grew up with Ultraman, both the TV show and manga, and was greatly influenced by the increasing popularity of pop culture in Japan. If video game designer hadn’t been a career option, Tajiri has stated that he probably would be making anime.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Freak Magazine</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1978, Space Invaders took Japanese arcades by storm, and Satoshi Tajiri was one of many to fall in love with the arcade shooter. Following the release of Space Invaders, the next game to capture Tajiri’s heart was Donkey Kong. Tajiri had a keen eye for tactics and strategies, so from a young age he began to write tips and tricks on how to beat his favourite games. He stapled these handwritten pages together and named it Game Freak. The fan magazine managed to create a young audience and gaming enthusiasts began to read Tajiri’s work. One of these readers was Ken Sugimori, a young boy only a few months younger than Tajiri, who had a real passion for video games and drawing. As Tajiri continued to write new issues of Game Freak, Sugimori had begun drawing illustrations for the magazine. Game Freak was eventually sold in stores, with the most successful issue themed around a game called Zabius, selling over 10,000 copies by 1983. But despite the success of the Game Freak magazine, Tajiri wanted to do more.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2264\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2264\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2264\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMagBugs.jpg?resize=900%2C644\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Game Freak Mag vol 1\" width=\"900\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMagBugs.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMagBugs.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMagBugs.jpg?resize=768%2C550&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMagBugs.jpg?resize=1024%2C733&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Left Page: Donkey Kong, Dig Dug, Fry Boy; Right Page: Kicks, Janputa, Pengo, Donkey Kong Jr.</p></div></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2265\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMag-Credit-Pokemon-Wiki.png?resize=500%2C667\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Game Freak Magazine\" width=\"500\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMag-Credit-Pokemon-Wiki.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMag-Credit-Pokemon-Wiki.png?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMag-Credit-Pokemon-Wiki.png?resize=300%2C400&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMag-Credit-Pokemon-Wiki.png?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GameFreakMag-Credit-Pokemon-Wiki.png?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Pokémon</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Game Freak continued to grow as a video game magazine publishing company, others had begun to contribute to the magazine. These contributors and Satoshi </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tajiri</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would often come together to discuss video games. They had begun noticing what made a good game and (more importantly) what made a bad game, and saw a lot of the latter in many games releasing at the time. They came to the conclusion that Game Freak would need to start making their own games. Thus Game Freak, the video game magazine company, became the video game development company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Freak’s first game was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quinty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (renamed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendel Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in North America) on June 27, 1989 for the Famicom (and on October 12, 1990 for the NES).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8EXeI8oe1M</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendel Palace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was created by the same team that would go on to make the original Pokémon games: Directed by Satoshi Tajiri, Art by Ken Sugimori and Music by Junichi Masuda. The game has the player on an adventure to save his girlfriend that has been kidnapped by a young girl. The setting has the player proceed through 5&#215;7 grid rooms filled with enemy dolls. To defeat the enemies, they player will need to flip the tiles and propel them into the wall or onto an impassable block. The player will need to defeat all of the enemies to proceed to the next level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game Freak was beginning to gain a reputation, and had begun making games using Nintendo’s original intellectual property, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoshi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the NES and Game Boy, as well as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mario &amp; Wario</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the SNES. Game Freak also made some titles for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magical Tarurūto-kun</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the critically acclaimed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pulseman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Japanese Yoshi (NES) commercial\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G-E59azV-VA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satoshi Tajiri was the director for all of Game Freak’s games (excluding </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magical Tarurūto-kun</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), but in the meantime </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tajiri</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had been working on his own side project.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concept</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satoshi Tajiri’s nostalgia for collecting bugs as a child sparked an idea inside of him. He could not shake those memories of exploring tall grass and long rivers in order to discover a wide range of bugs, animals and fish. Tajiri wished to create a game that would replicate that sense of wonder that he had experienced growing up. So from 1990, he had set to work on some concept designs and discussing his ideas with his team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, Pokémon didn’t quite look like the Pokémon that fans all know and love today. Lucky enough, fans have been able to view original concept designs for Pokémon, dating back to 1990. These designs allow us to see just how much it had changed up until its eventual release in 1996.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2243\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Capsule-Monsters.jpg?resize=438%2C616\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Capsule Monsters\" width=\"438\" height=\"616\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Capsule-Monsters.jpg?w=438&amp;ssl=1 438w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Capsule-Monsters.jpg?resize=213%2C300&amp;ssl=1 213w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Capsule-Monsters.jpg?resize=300%2C422&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original concept, known as Capsule Monsters, shared similarities to what it would end up becoming. For one, the concept of a trainer keeping monsters inside capsule-like balls was an idea that Tajiri had from the very beginning. Tajiri had always intended for the monsters to battle each other. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2266\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lapras-Concept.jpg?resize=400%2C425\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Lapras Concept\" width=\"400\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lapras-Concept.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lapras-Concept.jpg?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lapras-Concept.jpg?resize=300%2C319&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another piece of early concept art shows that Satoshi always wanted to implement the idea of being able to ride on top of water Pokémon. However what is especially surprising that despite Lapras going through some subtle design changes, the text below confirms that the Pokémon’s name was always intended to be Lapras.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2260\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rhydon-Concept-Design.jpg?resize=900%2C792\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Rhydon Concept Design\" width=\"900\" height=\"792\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rhydon-Concept-Design.jpg?w=1152&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rhydon-Concept-Design.jpg?resize=300%2C264&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rhydon-Concept-Design.jpg?resize=768%2C676&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rhydon-Concept-Design.jpg?resize=1024%2C901&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the bottom of this image, a monster is being hatched from an egg, which would later become a mainstay in the series from generation 2 onwards. There is also a Pokémon that somewhat resembles Rhydon as it and its trainer are exploring a cave. Lastly, the art style better resembles how Pokémon would eventually look, and maintains that signature Ken Sugimori art style.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2242\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cages-Concept.jpg?resize=630%2C591\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Cages\" width=\"630\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cages-Concept.jpg?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cages-Concept.jpg?resize=300%2C281&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst some things in this image look familiar, other concepts changed entirely. Marts in Pokémon certainly don’t have Pokémon locked up in cages or jars, something that was potentially scrapped due to the backlash that it may have received from animal protection agencies. One can also argue that it was due to Nintendo’s child-friendly philosophy, as they were apprehensive on the project from the very beginning. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2245\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Concept.jpg?resize=630%2C402\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Concept Trading\" width=\"630\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Concept.jpg?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Concept.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satoshi Tajiri always wanted to implement trading in Pokémon to encourage social communication. While trading didn’t become fully realised until 1996 with the eventual release of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green, it is clear that Tajiri had this in mind from the very beginning.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2267\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/City-Concept-1.jpg?resize=900%2C626\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon City Concept\" width=\"900\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/City-Concept-1.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/City-Concept-1.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/City-Concept-1.jpg?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/City-Concept-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C712&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/City-Concept-1.jpg?resize=1300%2C904&amp;ssl=1 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s difficult to say for sure, but this piece may have been an early concept design for Celadon City due to the three-storey mart on the left side of the sketch. The drawing also shows someone riding a bicycle, a staple in the Pokémon series. Ever since the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Monsters Red</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Monsters Green</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, players have been able to encounter trainers in cities with their Pokémon outside of their Poké Balls. Clearly, this was something very important to Tajiri as it reflected the idea of living in harmony with Pokémon.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2261\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slowbro-and-Gastly-Concept.jpg?resize=900%2C600\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Slowbro and Gastly Concept\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slowbro-and-Gastly-Concept.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slowbro-and-Gastly-Concept.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slowbro-and-Gastly-Concept.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slowbro-and-Gastly-Concept.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slowbro-and-Gastly-Concept.jpg?resize=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last piece of art, there appears to be more early concept of Pokémon that would go on to make the final cut. The trainer on the left has a Slowbro that, even though the image only shows the back of the Pokémon, looks exactly like its final design. On the other hand, the other Pokémon (Koffing) appears to be a lot different than its final design, being much larger and primarily made of gas. The trainer on the right also comes across as very aggressive with his whip, and whilst there are NPCs with whips in the original games, none show the action of using them whilst battling. This change could also be a result of Nintendo’s influence on the franchise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Satoshi Tajiri pitched his idea to Nintendo back in the early 90s, the meeting room was skeptical. They thought that Tajiri’s ideas were too ambitious and found it difficult to fully comprehend the concept. However there was one man sitting in that meeting room who saw great promise in Tajiri’s vision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That man was </span><a href=\"http://switchaboo.com/2017/12/22/legend-shigeru-miyamoto/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shigeru Miyamoto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the creator of Donkey Kong, the game that Satoshi Tajiri had written about in his first issue of Game Freak Magazine, Miyamoto had always been a huge influence on Tajiri and his work. Therefore, to get recognition from Miyamoto himself was a dream come true.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Monsters</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Nintendo’s scepticism on Satoshi Tajiri’s project, Shigeru Miyamoto had convinced them to put their faith in Game Freak. Tajiri instantly began development on what was then known as Capsule Monsters, with Miyamoto providing his professional expertise wherever necessary.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2239\" style=\"width: 445px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2239\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2239\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/435px-Capsule_Monsters_map.jpg?resize=435%2C599\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Map\" width=\"435\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/435px-Capsule_Monsters_map.jpg?w=435&amp;ssl=1 435w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/435px-Capsule_Monsters_map.jpg?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1 218w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/435px-Capsule_Monsters_map.jpg?resize=300%2C413&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An early concept design of the original Kanto map dated back to 1990. The original map design was largely unchanged in the eventual release of the game, however there do appear to be a few notable differences.</p></div></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all of the enthusiasm that Tajiri had for his project, it appeared that Nintendo’s initial scepticism was not unfounded. Capsule Monsters appeared to be too ambitious of an idea for the newly founded Game Freak. The development company were struggling financially and Tajiri had lost several employees as he could not afford to keep paying them. Game Freak had begun working on other titles to circumvent this issue. Tajiri would spend long days and sleepless nights attempting to see his vision come to fruition. However despite his efforts, Tajiri’s project was put on hold indefinitely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As years passed, Game Freak had developed a number of titles for Nintendo and Sega consoles in order to improve its financial situation. The company had clawed its way back to financial stability, and staff were eager to continue working on Tajiri’s brain child. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The further Tajiri’s concept had developed, the more issues they ran in to. For one, the name Capsule Monsters was inspired by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gachapon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a craze in Japan that allows you to place a coin in a machine in order to receive a capsule with a toy inside. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2240\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/597px-Poké_Ball_sketch.png?resize=597%2C600\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Gachapon\" width=\"597\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/597px-Poké_Ball_sketch.png?w=597&amp;ssl=1 597w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/597px-Poké_Ball_sketch.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/597px-Poké_Ball_sketch.png?resize=65%2C65&amp;ssl=1 65w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/597px-Poké_Ball_sketch.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/597px-Poké_Ball_sketch.png?resize=300%2C302&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it proved difficult to trademark the name, so Tajiri experimented with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capumon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before ultimately landing on the name Pocket Monsters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, Tajiri and Sugimori refused to let hardware limitations stifle their creativity. Together, they designed more than 200 monsters and attempted to implement every single one into the game. Their plan was to create as many as they wanted to, then cut out just enough so that they fit it onto the Game Boy cartridges. They eventually settled on 150, which seemed like an appropriate number to the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the concept of Pocket Monsters was beginning to take shape, and Game Freak had some more financial backing behind it, they were able to speed up the project’s development.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Development</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When development had initially begun, Tajiri envisioned his creation to be a more traditional RPG (as was growing increasingly popular in Japan at the time thanks to the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series). The game was originally designed around the concept of battling, with less focus on capturing and collecting. Tajiri had initially wanted to implement a charisma mechanic (similar to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wizardry</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) which would determine whether the monster would join the player’s team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years earlier, Satoshi Tajiri had noticed two people playing Tetris together by using the Game Boy’s link cable. The original concept for the link cable was purely to allow players to compete against one another in head-to-head competitive games. But Tajiri saw something different. He envisioned two bugs crawling down the cable, going from one Game Boy to the other. As difficult as it was for Tajiri to interact with others, he believed that the idea of capturing and trading these creatures would lead to lifelong friendships.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2246\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Game-Boy-Link-Cable.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Game Boy Link Cable\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Game-Boy-Link-Cable.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Game-Boy-Link-Cable.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Game-Boy-Link-Cable.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Game-Boy-Link-Cable.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development process took a lot longer than Game Freak had initially expected and many changes were made from the original concept. However, Game Freak always kept the trading aspect in tact from the very beginning as they believed it to be an enticing feature in the game. Tajiri had hoped that the idea of trading would encourage the series to grow in popularity due to word of mouth. He wanted kids to trade Pokémon on the school bus, on the playground or after school. Shigeru Miyamoto realized that this was essential to the series’ success and offered advice to Tajiri that they should split the game into two different versions, with some Pokémon being exclusive to a specific version.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t suggest splitting the games because it would allow us to sell more copies of the same thing. I just thought it would be more fun for the players if, say, there were 3 siblings and they all owned something unique. That way, they’d be able to communicate. I didn’t want to release separate versions of the games just to increase the marketability.”</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px;\">&#8211; Shigeru Miyamoto</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading up to the release, Game Freak wanted to have the option to play as a female character. This idea was ultimately scrapped; however, the character Green was still put into the manga series </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Adventures</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From generation two onwards, being able to choose between playing as a boy or a girl has been a mainstay in the series.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2247\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Green_RBY_Adventures.png?resize=400%2C300\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Green Manga Adventures\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Green_RBY_Adventures.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Green_RBY_Adventures.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legendary Pokémon Mew was not supposed to be in the final release of the game as the memory on the cartridge was almost at capacity. The team at Game Freak took a big risk in putting Mew in right at the end of development as a prank.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We put Mew in right at the very end. The cartridge was really full and there wasn&#8217;t room for much more on there.

Iwata read through the entire source code for the games and conducted an analysis that had allowed Nintendo programmer Teruki Murakawa to work on the localisation. In order for it to work, they needed to create an entirely new version from scratch.

Initially, both Clefairy and Pikachu were intended to be mascots, with Clefairy receiving most of the spotlight. However when they were getting ideas for the anime TV show, they went with Pikachu as the electric mouse had proven to appeal to a wider audience. They also thought that having a yellow mascot would be more easily recognisable as the only other yellow mascot at the time was Winnie the Pooh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pikachu was initially designed by artist Atsuko Nishida and was later only finalised by the more prolific Pokémon artist, Ken Sugimori. In a 2009 interview with Gamepro, Junichi Masuda stated that Pikachu was one of the most difficult character to settle on a final design for as they needed the electric mouse to be universally appealing to boys, girls and parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Red</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Blue</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was an instant success in North America.

With the TV Show airing a new episode every morning Monday to Friday, along with the games gaining popularity on the playground, Poké Mania was in full swing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice to make Pikachu the mascot of the series proved to be the best decision that The Pokémon Company had ever made. Surprisingly, it wasn’t Satoshi Tajiri’s idea to make Pikachu the mascot, however he did acknowledge the Pokémon’s widespread appeal. The Pokémon Games’ composer, Junichi Masuda, believes that Pikachu’s popularity was due to the Pokémon being Ash’s partner in the anime, which was a decision made by the production company, OLM Inc.. Satoshi Tajiri and the team at Game Freak were very excited for its release, despite their initial apprehension. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trivia: In the Japanese version of the Pokémon anime, Ash is named Satoshi (named after Satoshi Tajiri) and his original rival Gary is named Shigeru (named after Shigeru Miyamoto).</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2276 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?resize=260%2C260\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Yellow\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?resize=65%2C65&amp;ssl=1 65w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-Yellow.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Pikachu became so popular that it received its own version as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

This childhood memory of Tajiri’s was implemented in the Pokémon games from generation 4 onwards, allowing the player to battle and catch unique bug type Pokémon.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2255\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Diamond Pearl\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?resize=1300%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i0.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-DP.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During early concept stages, Tajiri had the idea that players will be able to battle with multiple Pokémon at once in order to bolster their stats. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Takuji and I finally finished negotiating. He’d agreed to trade one of his Fireflies for two of my Green Dragons. But I still felt like our exchange was a little unbalanced. I asked if he wouldn’t mind adding 5 Powerkings, monsters with the strength you might expect to see in soldiers, and we finally struck a bargain. Powerkings have a high encounter rate, and you’ll quickly run into them if you wander around dungeons. They’re strong, though, and the theory is that, if you have a lot of them, you can put them to work as soldiers when you run into other monsters. Takuji and I hooked up the Link Cable and traded monsters. The Game Boy plays sound effects as the monster data is being transferred, so we could hear the monsters’ cries.”</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Satoshi Tajiri (predicting how trading and gameplay would be implemented in the games)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this proved to be too ambitious for the Game Boy hardware, the idea was later implemented in the form of double battles from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Ruby</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and triple battles in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Black</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon White</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon Today</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many years have passed since trainers chose their very first Pokémon on the Game Boy, yet you can argue that the franchise is as popular as ever. Games continue to be released for modern systems and they consistently sell millions of copies with each iteration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any popular franchise, Pokémon has been successful in many different ways. The Pokémon Trading Card Game has a very loyal following, both professionally and casually. It was first introduced to Japan in October 1996, and to North America in 1998. According to the official Pokémon website, the Pokémon Trading Card Game has since sold 25.7 billion cards as of March 2018.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2258\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-TCG.jpg?resize=900%2C506\" alt=\"Satoshi Tajiri Pokémon Trading Card Game\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-TCG.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-TCG.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-TCG.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-TCG.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/switchaboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pokemon-TCG.jpg?resize=1300%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Official merchandise for the Pokémon franchise come in the form of anything you could imagine, from plush toys, to clothing, to an adorable snorlax bean bag.
