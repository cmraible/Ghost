One hasn’t been scheduled yet, so it might be a while before the supercar’s fate is known. What Ford is pushing for is a rescission of the original sale and the blockage of any other transfer or sale of the GT. In addition, the automaker wants $1 million in damages for breach of contract and misrepresentation. No doubt, Ford wishes to make an example out of these alleged scofflaws before others think they can pull any other schemes."
