        "markdown": "\nLast Friday’s [rather cryptic post](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/04/sunset.html \"Sunset…\") (I even tagged it as such) was about more than just the [switch to WordPress](http://www.onemanandhisblog.com/archives/2015/04/vale_movable_type.html \"Vale, Movable Type: a big move for this blog\"). I’ve been keen to slightly switch around my approach to writing *One Man & His Blog* for a while now, but a quirk of my personal psychology means that it’s easier to do at a point of discontinuity. A shift in blog platform is certainly that.\n\nLast year, one of the most personally profound moments I had was at the [Dots conference](http://brilliantnoise.com/dots/), arranged by [Brilliant Noise](http://brilliantnoise.com) and curated by [Neil Perkin](http://www.onlydeadfish.co.uk/only_dead_fish/2014/07/dots-connecting-ideas.html), both friends of the blog. Neil did a superb job of curating an event without a single weak speaker, but two in particular resonated with me.\n\n\n## Great artists steal – from a long way away\n\n![Mark Earls at Dots](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/mark-earls.jpg?resize=640%2C426 \"mark-earls.jpg\")\n\nFirst of all, Mark Earls made a compelling case that innovation is, in effect, [stealing from far away](http://brilliantnoise.com/speaker/mark-earls/):\n\n> Look a long way away from what you’re doing if you want to reinvent it. The man that invented boutique hotels took the idea of a nightclub and built hotels in that way. Marginal advantage is an idea from sport which borrows as many sources as possible. The sign of a good poet is someone who copies from far away, said TS Elliot. It’s easy to copy from next door…\n\n\n## Stagnation through introspection\n\nThat resonated with me because I’ve had a growing feeling that the discussion about digital journalism is stagnating, because it’s all happening internally to journalism. We’re looking at Buzzfeed and paywalls and what each other are doing, instead of casting our eyes outwards and seeing how technology and culture are changing. The former leads to copying, the latter to innovation.\n\n![Martin Elliott](https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2015/04/martin-elliott.jpg?resize=640%2C426 \"martin-elliott.jpg\")\n\nThe power of that idea was driven home by the brutally compelling talk by Professor Martin Elliott, about how the cardiac surgeons at [Great Ormond Street Hospital radically reduced death rates](http://brilliantnoise.com/speaker/professor-martin-elliott/) by borrowing from Formula One:\n\n> The Formula One teams always meet at round tables, they plan for what goes wrong and they mentally rehearse what’s going to happen. They mapped the process – and found the surgical one was 10 times more complicated. They tried engineering a new bed – but it was too expensive. So they focused on human factors. And every situation is a web of complex relationships that could go wrong.\n> \n>  So they focused on leadership and choreography. Leadership is transferred via a checklist as needed. The most important person they hired was a dancer. No-one knew where to stand. Ballet had the knowledge they needed.\n\nFormula One saving children’s lives in hospital? *That’s* stealing from a long way away – and that’s innovation.\n\n\n## Mental reset\n\nAt some point over the last couple of years, I’ve drifted into thinking of *One Man & His Blog* as a journalism blog, rather than Adam Tinworth’s blog. Now, the majority of my work currently is in journalism, so it’s always going to be heavily flavoured with journalism. But I’m granting myself the mental permission to write about wider issues that are informing the working part of my brain.\n\nIf we’re going to reinvent publishing and journalism, we need to get back to stealing from far away, as we did a decade or so back, rather than the circle-jerk of copying each marginal digital improvement that a particular site manages to create.\n\nSo, reboot time.\n\n\n"
