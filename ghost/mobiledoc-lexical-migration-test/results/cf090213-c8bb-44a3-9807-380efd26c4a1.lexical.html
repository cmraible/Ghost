<p><a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/winacunninghamC8corvette?promo=C1">Briggs Cunningham</a> was an American racing legend, sportsman, race team owner and Le Mans Mega-Star. He has been credited with creating America’s first modern sports cars after World War II. Cunningham was responsible for manufacturing some of racing's most storied race cars – especially, the stunning 1952 Cunningham C4R & C4RK Le Mans racers and the Cunningham C3 grand touring sports car.</p>

<p>Zora Arkus-Duntov asked Briggs in the 1960s is he thought there was potential in a Le Mans Corvette, and so they set out to find out. This mission put the Corvette on the first global racing stage, where it won its class that year, and finished 8th overall. Kevin Mackay would later find the 1960 Le Mans <a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/winacunninghamC8corvette?promo=C1">winning Corvette</a> and National Corvette Hall of Fame legend Chip Miller acquired it.</p>
<p><a href="https://chipmiller.tapkat.org/winacunninghamC8corvette?promo=C1">This example</a> is one of only 60 of the 60th Anniversary C8 Cunningham Corvettes that will be produced.

<p>Corvette enthusiasts are familiar with the name Chip Miller, the founder of Carlisle events with business partner Bill Miller (no relation). Miller owned about 80 Corvettes over his lifetime. Sadly, Chip Miller passed away in 2004 of amyloidosis, and that's when his wife Judy and partner Bill started the Chip Miller Amyloidosis Foundation in his honor. Many know Carlisle as the place to be for collector and classic cars as it is one of the biggest events in the country, and the Spring Carlisle show is a must for any car enthusiast. Corvettes of Carlisle is the largest gathering of 'Vettes in the world, bringing in about 5,000 each year.</p>
