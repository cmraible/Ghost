However, there’s an unfortunate stereotype of the Mustang driver who’s completely reckless, having zero regard for anyone else on the sidewalk. We see bad behavior from Challenger and Camaro drivers, too, but it’s stuff like this video of an S550 hitting a Lamborghini Huracan, then taking off like nothing happened which works to reinforce the unfortunate stereotype."

After all, if you hit someone else’s ride you better as hell stop and provide your insurance information. Not only is it illegal to engage in a hit-and-run, it’s just a jerk move."

Then he just keeps on driving."
