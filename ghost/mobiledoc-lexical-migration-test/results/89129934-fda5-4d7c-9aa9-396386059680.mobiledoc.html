<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/nancy-pelosi/">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> has long kept silent as to whether President Joe Biden should cancel student debt — but that changed in late July. “The president can’t do it — so that’s not even a discussion,” she said during a news conference, stunning colleagues. As we detail in this week’s Weekend Reader, <em>The Intercept </em>discovered Pelosi made the announcement after she received a private memo from Democratic megadonors.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/08/05/student-debt-cancellation-nancy-pelosi/"><strong>Nancy Pelosi’s Surprise Flip On Student Debt Cancellation Came After Urging From Billionaire Power Couple</strong></a> (The Intercept) — <em>“In November, after Biden’s election, and amid increased pressure to cancel student debt, the Swigs quietly circulated a memo among key Capitol Hill figures, making the dubious case that debt cancellation at the executive level is illegal. The argument in the memo gets much of its weight by virtue of the wealthy couple who produced it, as the Swigs are not just major funders of progressive nonprofits, but also have significantly bankrolled Pelosi and her House Democratic caucus.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/05/ex-buttigieg-strategist-pr-execs-helped-cuomo-fight-accusations/"><strong>Ex-Buttigieg Strategist, PR Execs Helped Gov. Cuomo Fight Sex-Harass Accusations</strong></a> (The New York Post) — <em>“CNN host Chris Cuomo isn’t the only media-savvy guru outside Albany who quietly helped his big brother fight sex-harassment allegations. Gov. Andrew Cuomo enlisted a wide range of politically connected advisers who weren’t part of his staff — including Pete Buttigieg’s former communications director and two executives at a top public relations firm with ties to Sen. Chuck Schumer and Google, according to the New York attorney general’s investigation. “</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/amanda-knox-stillwater-matt-damon/619628/"><strong>Who Owns Amanda Knox?</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>In her own words, Knox confronts the lingering trauma of being famous for having been wrongfully convicted for killing her roommate: “Does my name belong to me? Does my face? What about my life? My story? Why is my name used to refer to events I had no hand in? I return to these questions again and again because others continue to profit off my identity, and my trauma, without my consent.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/thomas-james-tragic-murder-case"><strong>The Tragic Case of the Wrong Thomas James</strong></a><strong></strong>(GQ)<strong></strong>— <em>“The great tragedy of this case is not just that Thomas Raynard James was wrongfully convicted. That, unfortunately, happens all too often. The singularity of this tragedy is that he found a way to discover an improbable truth and it wasn't enough to get anybody's attention. The criminal justice system, that vast assemblage of state agencies and bureaucracies, is not designed to look backward. It is a juggernaut that rolls unceasingly forward.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/aug/05/paul-gilroy-britain-scholar-race-humanism-vital-guide-age-of-crisis"><strong>The Last Humanist: How Paul Gilroy Became The Most Vital Guide To Our Age Of Crisis</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Guardian) — <em>“For all the plaudits, there is something unsettling about Gilroy’s way of looking at the world. He is an untimely figure. His ideas don’t correspond to the vogueish pieties of identity politics or even cutting-edge studies of race. He is that most intellectually unfashionable thing, a humanist. And despite his insistence on understanding the importance of race, he has paradoxically spent much of his life encouraging people to work towards something radical, even utopian: moving beyond the idea of race altogether.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/books-mining-how-yellowcake-shaped-the-west?fbclid=IwAR0stmCkvBsfPB_gBmfgXWY3JsZllp6_ByQC3-oWVktirx6QAe24ELsGrZw"><strong>How Yellowcake Shaped The West</strong></a><strong></strong>(High Country News) —<em> “No matter how many millions of tons of tailings are removed, and how many millions of dollars are spent to ‘reclaim’ the land, the toxic legacy endures, somewhere, somehow. Radioactive, heavy-metal-laden water continues to seep into Many Devils Wash, adjacent to the site of the Shiprock mill, and then into the San Juan River, flummoxing scientists. Groundwater beneath the Durango dog park still swims with high levels of uranium, lead and other contaminants. And, in Monticello, shallow groundwater is still contaminated with elevated levels of uranium, arsenic, and manganese, and every effort to clean it up has failed.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/08/04/evictions-wall-street-corporate-landlords/"><strong>Wall Street Investors Press Corporate Landlords On Eviction Plan</strong></a><strong></strong>(The Intercept) — <em>“Many of the largest investor-owned apartment trusts have carefully tracked pandemic-related restrictions on landlords, preparing for a return to normal so that those late on payments can be removed and rents can be increased. The push for profits comes despite the fact that many corporate landlords are roaring back and performing better than ever.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/labor/anatomy-of-an-anti-union-meeting/"><strong>Anatomy Of An Anti-Union Meeting</strong></a> (The American Prospect) — <em>“Under the guise of voter education, unions were depicted as corrupt, money-grubbing businesses that would neglect workers and tear companies apart. Workers were told that their bid for collective bargaining could lead to cuts to pay and benefits; that they could be dragged before kangaroo courts and fined heavily for breaking union rules; that at a company like No Evil Foods, they would usher in a culture starkly at odds with progressive values and social justice. Most of all, employees were told that the union would upend a successful startup business, and get in the way of the team spirit and mutual trust that made No Evil Foods great.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nysfocus.com/2021/07/30/cancel-rent-promises-failures/"><strong>The Promises And Failures Of The “Cancel Rent” Movement</strong></a> (New York Focus) — <em>“Some proponents and detractors alike saw ‘Cancel Rent’ as merely a messaging strategy to capture the public imagination and motivate tenants to take action. Others understood it as a strategy to demand the impossible and, in doing so, to increase the chances of winning a straightforward budgetary demand for the state to spend billions of dollars to pay accumulated back rent. For Housing Justice for All, it was not an impossible demand, but a call — taken up in legislation at both the federal and state levels — for a fundamental reorientation of housing subsidy programs towards a framework in which the state’s role is not primarily to guarantee landlords’ revenue streams, but to keep people in their homes.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/work-peak-professional-decline/590650/"><strong>Your Professional Decline Is Coming (Much) Sooner Than You Think</strong></a> (The Atlantic) — <em>“In many physically nondemanding occupations, we implicitly reject the inevitability of decline before very old age. Sure, our quads and hamstrings may weaken a little as we age. But as long as we retain our marbles, our quality of work as a writer, lawyer, executive, or entrepreneur should remain high up to the very end, right? Many people think so. I recently met a man a bit older than I am who told me he planned to ‘push it until the wheels came off.’ In effect, he planned to stay at the very top of his game by any means necessary, and then keel over. But the odds are he won’t be able to. The data are shockingly clear that for most people, in most fields, decline starts earlier than almost anyone thinks.”</em></p>
