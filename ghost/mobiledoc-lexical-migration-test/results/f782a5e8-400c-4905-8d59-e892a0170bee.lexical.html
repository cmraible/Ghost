<p>From 1961 through 1965, Chevrolet's then-new big block V8 <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5923/1964-chevy-impala-ss?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">ruled the streets</a> in 409 cubic inch form. Horsepower ratings climbed almost every year, and by 1964, the dual quad version was good for 425 horsepower and 425 lb/ft of torque.</p>

<p>Even though it was replaced by the mighty 396 – a new big block design – in 1966, the 409 holds a special place in the hearts of many enthusiasts. The <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5923/1964-chevy-impala-ss?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">409-powered 1961-1964 Chevrolet Impala SS</a> remains a desirable collectible. </p>
<p>The car seen here is a <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5923/1964-chevy-impala-ss?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">1964 Chevrolet Impala SS</a>, offered for sale by Worldwide Vintage Autos. It's powered by a single-carb 409, backed up by a four-speed manual mounted to the floor between a pair of bucket seats. It's the final year of what we'd consider to be the most popular Impala body style ever.</p>

<p>Besides the American Racing Torq-Thrust wheels, <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5923/1964-chevy-impala-ss?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">this Impala SS</a> looks the same as it did when it rolled out of the factory. According to the ad, it was restored by a previous owner, and the work appears to have been of high quality.</p>
<p>The car has held up well, too. Aside from some minor rock chips, this Impala has been given a clean bill of health by <a href="https://www.worldwidevintageautos.com/vehicles/5923/1964-chevy-impala-ss?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">the selling dealer</a>. They even include a copy of the inspection on their website.</p>
