<hr>
<p>In general, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche">Porsche</a> likes to underestimate performance specs for its <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles">cars</a>. It’s a good practice and one quite a few other automakers follow, because that sure beats claiming more horsepower or quicker acceleration than the reality. Someone will always want to test things out and then word travels quickly. That’s why it’s surprising that during a high-speed test of a 2019 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche/911%20GT3%20RS">Porsche 911 GT3 RS</a> done this week at Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds resulted in the car not hitting the published top speed.</p>
<p>On the runway, the hopped-up Porsche 991 hit 187 mph during the 2.3-mile sprint. Porsche claims the top speed for the car is a blistering 194 mph. Sure, that’s only 7 mph difference but some are asking why in that long of a stretch the car didn’t hit that.</p>
<p>It’s completely possible conditions weren’t quite right for a 194-mph run. There are a dizzying number of factors which contribute to hitting such a high speed in a car, especially safely, and Johhnny Bohmer Proving Grounds provided an exhaustive list. Runway Specifications: Length: (3.22 Miles) or (5.15 Kilometers) Width: (300 Feet) or (91.44 Meters) Elevation Above Sea Level: (8.3 Feet) or (2.53 Meters) Elevation Change: (0.25 Inches) or (0.635 Centimeters) Surface Material: Concrete - (15,000 Feet) or (4,572 Meters) Asphalt - (2,000 Feet) or (609.6 Meters). Weather Conditions: 10am: Temp: 23C/73.4F Dew point: 18C/64.4F Humidity: 73% Wind: 00000kt (0 mph) Surface Temp: 25C/77F. Time of the run: 3pm. Temp: 26C/78.8F Dew point: 18C/64.4F Humidity: 61% Wind: 09008kt (9 MPH) Wind Direction: southeast Surface Temp: 33.9C/93F.</p>
<p>There’s much to be impressed with when examining the 2019 <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/search/Porsche/911">Porsche 911</a>GT3 RS. The 4.0-liter flat-six engine has been tuned to produce 520-horsepower and 346 lb.-ft. of torque. That’s considerable since you’re dealing with a car that weighs just 3,260 pounds. A seven-speed automatic transmission takes the human error out of shifting, which isn’t as much fun but is optimal for performance.</p>

<p>Despite all that power, the huge rear wing and other aggressive aero elements actually help work against the car hitting an even higher top speed. Those were slapped on to help the GT3 RS stick turns like it’s glued to the track, not set speed records. This is the car you want to use on a track with plenty of tight, tricky turns. It’s impressive the Porsche hit 187 mph but at the same time it’s ok to ask why it didn’t reach 194 mph. Just how long of a stretch is needed to hit that?</p>
