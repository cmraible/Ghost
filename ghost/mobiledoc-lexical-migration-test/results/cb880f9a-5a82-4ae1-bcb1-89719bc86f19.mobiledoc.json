Maximum output now measures a whopping 500 horsepower, so you’ll blow the doors off the competition and they will most likely be shocked. A performance exhaust system and Hurst short throw shifter round out a solid build."

But the exterior of this Camaro is aggressive while being strategically restrained, avoiding some of the over-the-top excesses you get with certain builds. Forged aluminum wheels, a tail splitter rear spoiler, Hendrick Performance carbon fiber rear valance, and snake splitter front fascia add a nice edge. HID headlights light up the night and top off those amazing aesthetics."

Black leather upholstery, power moonroof with express open, front seat heaters, OnStar, a Boston Acoustic 9-speaker sound system, satellite radio, Bluetooth, and other factory features make for a really nice experience. There’s also a supplemental gauge package in the center console so you can keep your eye on vitals when pushing this Chevy to the limit."
