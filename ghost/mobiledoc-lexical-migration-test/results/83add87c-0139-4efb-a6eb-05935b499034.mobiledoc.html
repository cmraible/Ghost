<p>We’ve long been reporting on how corporate nursing home owners are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-wall-street-kills-grandma/">slashing care</a> in their facilities while raking in massive profits, and how new laws are <a href="__GHOST_URL__/investigation-cuomo-gave-immunity/">protecting</a> those executives from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/they-cant-hold-the-nursing-homes/">accountability</a>. Now we have those owners admitting to the grift themselves. As we highlight in this edition of Weekend Reader, <em>The American Prospect</em> just pulled back the curtain on an explosive new lawsuit filed by New York nursing home owners pushing back against a new state law that would have simply required them to spend 70 percent of their revenue on patient care. Late last year, hundreds of New York nursing homes went to court to avoid having to focus their resources on their own patients — and the reasons they gave for opposing the law are eye-opening.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://prospect.org/health/nursing-home-slumlord-manifesto/"><strong>The Nursing Home Slumlord Manifesto</strong></a><strong></strong>(The American Prospect) <em>— “Taken together, the [nursing] homes claim that if the new law had been in effect in 2019, the government would have clawed back $824 million in ‘constitutionally protected’ profits from the nursing homes, one-third of which would have been coughed up by the top 40 most profitable homes alone. ‘I think what that number indicates is the amount of money they’re supposed to be spending on care that they’re instead extracting in profits,’ said Ron Kim, the Queens assemblyman who introduced the safe staffing law. Indeed, if the complaint’s figures are accurate, the state would have more than a billion dollars per year with which to recruit, train, and deploy extra nursing staffers to struggling facilities if it actually enforced the law.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/01/to-fight-climate-change-bring-back-state-planning.html?utm_medium=s1&utm_campaign=nym&utm_source=tw"><strong>To Fight Climate Change, Bring Back State Planning</strong></a> (New York Magazine) <em>— “Although clean-energy investments need to be significant to avert catastrophe — on the order of 1 to 2 percent of GDP at the conservative end — the results would very likely be anti-inflationary given the outsize role fossil fuels tend to play in driving the [Consumer Price Index]. Decarbonizing the power sector and retrofitting homes and buildings to run on that new grid, as Green New Deal proposals outline, would not just create millions of jobs but decouple life’s essentials from fossil-fuel price volatility. The same is true of large-scale investments in electrified transit that, besides slashing deadly air pollution and cutting down on traffic, would give many more people a less intimate connection to oil-market decisions made an ocean away.”</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/01/stephen-breyer-is-retiring-the-liberal-justice-was-an-ineffectual-leader.html"><strong>Stephen Breyer Couldn’t Meet The Moment</strong></a><strong></strong></strong>(Slate) <em>— “In recent years, it appeared that Breyer held onto a fantasy of the Supreme Court that no longer existed. He really believed that he could reason with his hard-right colleagues to secure trade-offs that would serve the greater interests of the court and American democracy. Time and again, he tried to prove his good faith by voting with the conservative wing. Time and again, his Republican-appointed colleagues rebuffed these olive branches, plowing ahead with their agenda over Breyer’s increasingly desperate pleas for moderation.”</em></li>

Humans and the environments we have created are not immune to this rule, and we must recognize that we have unleashed the fire-predator through our own choices.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/human-sacrifice-ritual-mass-vaccination/621355/"><strong>The Anti-Vaccine Right Brought Human Sacrifice To America</strong></a> (The Atlantic) <em>— “For a long time now the right’s ongoing propaganda campaign against and organized political resistance to vaccination, among other public-health protocols, has been killing many, many Americans for no reasonable, ethically justifiable social purpose. In other words, what we’ve experienced certainly since the middle of 2021 is literally ritual human sacrifice on a mass scale — the real thing, comparable to the innumerable ghastly historical versions.”</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/165066/osha-vaccine-mandate-gorsuch-roberts?fbclid=IwAR3aHm8L4GkBTEJJH9L0hVh4XBKfqTe2mwWb0FSEE0MDOew0dkARMzpG8OY"><strong>Biden Misread the Supreme Court’s Ruling Against The OSHA Vaccine Rule</strong></a><strong></strong></strong>(The New Republic) <em>— “The two opinions reveal a gap potentially deep and consequential, both in terms of a short-term opportunity for the Biden administration to adopt robust new workplace vaccination requirements and in their long-term constitutional implications. These differences appear especially sharp against the backdrop of the recent drumbeat among conservative legal luminaries, including Supreme Court justices, for exhuming a long-defunct, radically anti-regulatory constitutional concept, the so-called “nondelegation” doctrine… If, indeed, these two opinions do expose a rift this profound, it is possible to view the decision as a partial, though meaningful, 6–3 </em>liberal <em>victory — turning down a clear opportunity to embrace Gorsuch’s cataclysmic vision to actually dismantle, as distinguished from more tightly constrain, the modern ‘administrative state.’”</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/family-capitalism-and-the-small-business-insurrection"><strong>Family Capitalism And The Small Business Insurrection</strong></a><strong></strong></strong>(Dissent) <em>— “When the largest publicly listed corporations and their trade associations — chief among them the Business Roundtable — made their peace with the New Deal state in the wake of the Second World War, small business conservatives remained aloof, convinced that big business was just as responsible as big government was for the growth of tax and regulatory burdens. The Business Roundtable continued to collaborate with both major parties even as it rebelled against the Fordist consensus in the 1970s. By contrast, small business conservatives have always rubbed shoulders with the nativist, theocratic, and white supremacist currents of the American far right.”</em></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/cryptocurrency-scam-blockchain-bitcoin-economy-decentralization"><strong>Cryptocurrency Is A Giant Ponzi Scheme</strong></a><strong></strong></strong>(Jacobin) <em>— “Given that cryptocurrencies don’t produce anything of material value, this enormous waste of resources renders the whole enterprise a negative-sum game. Investors can only cash out by selling their coins to other investors — but only after the miners and various cryptocurrency service providers take the house’s rake. In other words, investors cannot — in the aggregate — cash out for even what they put in, as cryptocurrencies are inefficient by design. This makes them a poor and costly form of currency and absolutely ludicrous as a long-term investment.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/led-zeppelin-gets-into-your-soul-jimmy-page-robert-plant-and-bob-spitz-biography"><strong>Led Zeppelin Gets Into Your Soul</strong></a> (The New Yorker) <em>— “If half the group’s energy was proto-punk destruction, the other half was musically refined restoration: it was the world’s most brilliantly belated blues band. Its violence tore things apart which its musicianship put back together. In this respect, Led Zeppelin was the opposite of punk, whose anarchic negation was premised on not being able to play one’s instrument well, or, in some cases, at all. But Page was already one of London’s most successful session guitarists, and a member of the group the Yardbirds, when, in the summer of 1968, he began to pick the members of his new group, aiming for a declaration of musical supremacy.”</em></li>
