The massive engine is fitted with a high performance, high lift camshaft, a Holley 4-barrel carburetor, aluminum intake manifold, and tube headers. Performance spark plug wires and distributor provide plenty of spark and dual electric fans keep things cool."

Moreover, the  SS factory steering wheel is a very nice touch and the floor mounted shifter perfectly controls the Muncie 4-speed."
