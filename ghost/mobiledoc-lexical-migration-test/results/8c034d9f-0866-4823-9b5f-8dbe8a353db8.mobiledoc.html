<p><em>The Daily Poster</em> today is launching a new partnership with <em>‎Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar,</em> in which they will be covering the journalism we’re doing every week on their hugely popular Youtube show and podcast. Each week on <em>Breaking Points</em>, <em>Daily Poster </em>paying subscribers will get to see our reporters unpacking the stories we are breaking and updating you on the state of play in American politics.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DY5Yvrg9F4">first installment</a>, in which we discuss our big follow-the-money scoops related to the reconciliation bill:</p>

<p>We will be sending out these clips once a week to our subscribers. We are really thrilled about this partnership and encourage you to <a href="https://breakingpoints.supercast.tech">subscribe to <em>Breaking Points</em> here</a>. You can also find their YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDRIjKy6eZOvKtOELtTdeUA">here</a>.</p>
<p>This collaboration adds to our partnerships with <em>Jacobin</em>, <em>Newsweek, The Guardian</em>, <em>The Hill</em>, <em>The American Prospect</em>, <em>The Intercept,</em> and <em>Earther.</em> All of these partnerships help defray the costs of doing our labor-intensive investigations, allow our work to have wider distribution and a bigger impact, and add to the movement to build an independent, non-corporate media.</p>
