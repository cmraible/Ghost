Corporate Democrats in Congress have been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/01/pelosi-salt-relief-478874"><em>pushing</em></a> to remove the $10,000 cap on SALT deductions — if that repeal happens, most of the benefits of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/corporate-dems-show-progressives/"><em>would flow</em></a> to the top 5 percent of earners. But Biden and Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez are uniting against the tax breaks, in a show of <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1378068461763497984?s=20"><em>Democratic unity</em></a> that you love to see.</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://prospect.org/politics/progressive-policies-moderates-hate-provide-cost-savings-moderates-want/"><strong>Prescription Drug Pricing Reform Could Help Fund Infrastructure Bill</strong></a><strong></strong>(The American Prospect) — <em>“...drug pricing is back, expected to be announced in the second part of the infrastructure package. And the debate over which version of the drug-pricing bill to pursue will be a perfect showcase of moderates’ commitment to saving money and bringing down the bill’s cost. The progressive drug-pricing bill, which allows Medicare to negotiate down prices, widens eligibility for generic drugs, and removes the tax deduction for drug corporation advertising, would save the federal government a ton of money. The moderate-preferred drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, which does less to empower Medicare to negotiate, would save the government little.”</em></li>
    <li><a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/nina-turner-ohio-cleveland-akron-fundraiser-vote-run-congress"><strong>Nina Turner Hopes To Move Ohio Left</strong></a> (In These Times) — <em>Former Ohio State Senator and Bernie Sanders surrogate Nina Turner’s congressional campaign in Ohio is underway, and she’s raking in local endorsements and small dollar donations. “Turner’s platform includes a $15 minimum wage, recurring stimulus checks and free public college, which she believes her working-class constituents need,” </em>In These Times<em> reports.</em></li>
