          "A news report out of Virginia Beach caught our eyes recently, claiming criminals are using a new tactic to avoid getting caught as they steal cars. Usually we’re pretty skeptical about these sorts of claims because they usually detail out methods we’ve seen replicated over and over. And while it’s great to help the masses in different areas understand how car thieves steal private property, it’s usually old news to us. Except this time it wasn’t."

When the woman noticed the luxury vehicle was gone, she asked to see her neighbor’s Ring video. What the doorbell camera captured was a black SUV driving up to her house, a man getting out, walking up the driveway, and then it all goes black."

It might take more time or cost more if you’re having someone else install them, but it guards against a signal jammer hiding what criminals are doing around your house. It also doesn’t hurt to park in the garage, even in the middle of the day."

Thieves love to exploit our laziness and unwillingness to think too much about how they can take advantage of us. Those aren’t pleasant things to dwell on, however as crime continues to surge it’s becoming more of a necessity. The woman interviewed by the local news said she’s going to put Apple AirTags in her vehicles. We’d recommend doing that and more."
