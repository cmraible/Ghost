This means in turn their environmental impact is minimal when compared to modern cars. After all, right now a 40 year-old car was manufactured in 1980. How often do you see something so old tooling around on roads?"

Already, they can’t be used for daily driving, but instead are restricted to club activities, exhibition drives, parades, tours, and other occasional situations. That alone cuts down on any contribution they make to air pollution, so requiring the cars to pass strict emissions tests is too much, says SEMA Action Network."
