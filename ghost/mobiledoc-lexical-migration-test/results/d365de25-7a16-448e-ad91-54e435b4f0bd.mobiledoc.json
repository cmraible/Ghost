Inside, you'll also find carbon fiber accents on the dash, center console and shifter, and this 911 is also equipped with the Nokia Digital Hi-Fi sound system and a six-disc CD changer. As proof of how well this car has been treated over the last 23 years, it still has all of its original parts including the radio, tools, original keys and remotes and all of the factory books in their leather pouch."

The 3.6-liter twin-turbo flat-six produced an amazing 400 horsepower, and this engine mated to an equally impressive six-speed manual gearbox. The 993 911 Turbo used an all-wheel drive trickled down from the legendary Porsche 959, and while Porsche first introduced an all-wheel-drive 911 in 1988 with the Carrera 4, this was the first time this technology was applied to the 911 Turbo. With all that power and traction, acceleration in the 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo will snap your neck back with a 0-60 mph time in around 3.6 seconds."
