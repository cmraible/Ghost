<p>It goes without argument that this could be the coolest giveaway yet. The <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS">2020 C8</a> coupe is a hot car, and a pretty hard car to find. Painted in Torch Red with black wheels and a matching red-and-black interior, this Corvette 3LT is loaded up with all the goodies including the Z51 performance package. While a base C8 Corvette Stingray Coupe runs $59,995, this loaded example being given away has a retail price of more than $90,000.</p>
<p>The vintage Corvette in the bundle in this bundle, is a gorgeous <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/tickets/corvette?promo=MOTORIOUS">1962 Corvette </a>restomod that was created by Lingenfelter Performance, and it's a custom build, with high-end workmenship. Riding on a Art Morrison chassis, this Corvette is powered by a fuel-injected LS3 V8 that sends power to the rear tires through an electronic four-speed automatic transmission and Ford nine-inch rear end. The custom body features a ZR1-style glass window in the hood to show off the legendary engine similar to the view you get of the C8's mid-mounted LT2 V8.</p>
