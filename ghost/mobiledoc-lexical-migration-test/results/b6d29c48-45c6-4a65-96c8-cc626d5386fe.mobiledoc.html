<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Today is a very exciting day on <em>The Lever</em>’s podcast network. On <em>Lever Time</em>, we interview U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) about his new book <em>The Scheme: How the Right Wing Used Dark Money to Capture the Supreme Court</em>, which details the rise of dark money in politics, and what comes next in the battle against the flood of anonymous cash subverting American democracy. On <em>The Audit</em>, the study group delves into the next three lessons of George W. Bush’s MasterClass, including the importance of clear communication. Because as we all remember, Bush was a poetic wordsmith who never flubbed a line.</p>

<p>In the new episode of <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota and Andrew Perez sit down with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to talk about his new book, <em>The Scheme: How the Right Wing Used Dark Money to Capture the Supreme Court</em>, and what’s next in the battle to end dark money — like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/how-a-secretive-billionaire-handed-his-fortune-to-the-architect-of-the-right-wing-takeover-of-the-courts/">$1.6 billion secret donation</a> we exposed — in politics.</p>

<p>In addition, David speaks with Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who also serves as the chair of the Democratic Secretaries of State Association. David and Jena discuss the slate of election-denying Republican candidates who are running to oversee their state’s elections, and why the results of this year’s secretaries of state races are so vital.</p>

<p>In the new episode of <em>The Audit</em>, Dave, Josh, and their study-buddy Kate Willett get close (but sadly, not close enough) to completing George W. Bush’s MasterClass.</p>

<p>Up until this point, the study group has subjected themselves to hours of historiographical propaganda attempting to whitewash Bush’s legacy. This week isn’t any different, as the crew work their way through Dubya’s next three lessons: “Own Your Own Communication Style;” “A Pathway to Politics;” and “Entering Public Service.” All of which is ironic, coming from a guy who constantly put his foot in his mouth, got into politics because of his daddy, and almost exclusively served private interests during his presidency. The real lesson here? Lying is usually legal.</p>
