After all, when you buy a new Bentley Bacalar and add all kinds of bespoke details to it, you’ll also have to customize your private jet and helicopter to match. It’s truly a burden carrying such a responsibility, something we and you will never completely grasp. That’s why we share the burden of this guy who was profiled by Bentley."

The specimen in question was painted Julep, a bespoke color which the owner just adores, meaning he just had to have the same color stripes applied to his Gulfstream G650. The struggle is real."

What’s more, the wood veneers were made to match the 5,000-year-old reclaimed river wood trim in the luxury sports car. You wouldn’t understand why this is important, but it really is."
