The thing is the topic has been discussed before and while it’s certainly something interesting, Bloomberg is hardly the only one covering it. To help our readers decide if they need to jump on this trend, we’ve decided to shed even more light on a “legal loophole” some have decided to use."

That’s right, affluent car collectors in places like California and New York have found a way to not pay out ridiculous sums of money just because they have a Ferrari LaFerrari, McLaren 720S, or Koenigsegg Agera."

          "The big question is why more enthusiasts don’t take advantage of this loophole? In part, it’s a money thing. Those businesses which take care of everything for you use a law firm for part of the work, and if you’ve ever had to hire an attorney you already know they’re not cheap. Plus, as Demuro points out, if you don’t carry a more exotic insurance policy, you might face some uncomfortable questions if you ever have to file a claim where you live. Those types of policies also aren’t as budget-friendly. But if you’re saving tens of thousands on taxes for your supercar, such expenses are negligible. The next time you attend an even where supercars are present, see if you spot any Montana license plates."
