<p>This car make look like a <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4682/1969-pontiac-trans-am-tribute-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">'69 Trans Am</a>, but it's actually a very convincing tribute based on a standard <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1-of-499-ram-air-iii-1969-pontiac-trans/">1969 Pontiac Firebird</a>. It's been carefully restored to look and perform just like the genuine article.</p>

<p>The big difference, though, is the price. We're not sure what this car will ultimately sell for, but it will certainly be less than the genuine article. That's good news for enthusiasts who want to enjoy their cars and <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4682/1969-pontiac-trans-am-tribute-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">drive them hard</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4682/1969-pontiac-trans-am-tribute-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">This car</a> was subjected to a painstaking frame-off restoration, during which the floor pans and trunk were replaced with new reproduction steel panels. Everything was replaced, from the upholstery to the weatherstripping. Even the glass was replaced.</p>
<p>This is likely as close as you can realistically get to a <a href="https://www.premierauctiongroup.com/vehicles/4682/1969-pontiac-trans-am-tribute-restomod?utm_source=motorious.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=motorious">brand new 1969 Trans Am</a>. Under the hood, you'll find an era-correct 400 cubic inch Pontiac V8 backed up by a four speed manual transmission.</p>
