Some didn’t think so when the Corvette super car emerged, believing the supercharged LS9 V8 was as good as it got. Going beyond the limits was exactly the approach Lingenfelter took with this car. Now it’s pushing a stout 710-horsepower for a nice edge over cars running factory spec."

GM made a big deal about how the car boasts 1g of lateral grip, proving it’s not something build to just go fast in a straight line. Brembo carbon-ceramic disc brakes, Magnetic Ride Control, and speed-sensitive variable-ratio rack-and-pinion steering help you maintain comfortable control."

Among them is dual-zone climate control, so you’re not fighting with your significant other over whether it’s too hot or cold. The Ebony leather seats are comfortable, even for a long road trip. Plus, you can listen to the 7-speaker Bose sound system."
