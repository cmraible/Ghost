But a whole list of upgrades included in the Mammoth 900 package are geared at getting the pickup to scoot in a hurry. It starts with a ported supercharger snout along with a supercharger drive pulley upgrade and drive hub assembly upgrade to make the most out of the forced induction setup for the Hellcat V8. "

After all, the track-oriented setup from Chevy puts at the driver’s command 650-hp with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Lightweighting through the use of carbon-fiber parts and forged-aluminum wheels also help, but it’s debatable how useful the aggressive aero elements like the tall rear wing, prominent front splitter, and those dive planes are on a drag strip. Sure, they’re great to have on a circuit, but this is about going fast in a straight line, not sticking hairpin turns."
