In his research, he concludes that humans do not originate from Aegis but from an entirely different planet (or even, a different universe). Countless hours pass by and eventually he and his assistant discover a strange signal emanating from a mysterious galaxy far far away. Milodane and Nevus begin their preparation to visit this strange planet in the hopes of finding signs of intelligent life. However, after arriving, Milo is awoken by a fuzzy little creature called Ridmi and standing in a huge hallway within a gigantic house. The inhabitants are all little creatures called tinykin; clearly something has gone terribly wrong!",
