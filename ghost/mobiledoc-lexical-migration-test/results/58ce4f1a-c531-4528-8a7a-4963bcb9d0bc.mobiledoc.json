Now it’s worth more than plenty of new cars, including any new Corolla, that’s how quickly the market for Japanese sports cars is blowing up."

While the AE86 was a force to be reckoned with in rally racing, the narrow track width and rear-wheel-drive layout made it the perfect vehicle for drifting as that rose in popularity. This was one of the few to escape that crazy unscathed."
