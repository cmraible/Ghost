<hr>
<p>Back in the day, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/muscle/">muscle cars</a> were relatively affordable or even cheap, depending on the model. It was a way for the average Joe to get a <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-cuda/">fun, powerful ride</a>. Many weren’t all that flashy and certainly wouldn’t have been considered luxurious in any serious way. Times certainly have certainly changed, but even with more <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/are-modern-muscle-cars-safe/">modern muscle cars</a> being <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/sema-1970-challenger/">prestige machines</a>, the Equus Bass 770 is quite the anomaly.</p>

<p>First revealed to the public in 2014, the Equus Bass 770 obviously draws inspiration from a handful of classic American muscle cars, most obviously the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-classic-mustang/">Ford Mustang</a>, but with several elements from the classic <a href="https://www.dreamgiveaway.com/dg/hellcat?promo=MOTORIOUS9">Dodge Charger</a>. In fact, the design inspiration came from the movie <em>Bullitt</em>. However, it debuted with a price point of $230,000 to $250,000. If you want a bespoke model, tack on another $100,000 or so. That’s well beyond what people were paying for <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-dodge-viper/">Dodge Vipers</a> out the door, so it’s understandable why some people think that’s a little much.</p>
<p>About that steep price, there’s a good reason for it. When it was in production, the Bass 770 was made entirely by hand. Equus co-owner Michael Shariff says it takes between 4,500 to 5,000 man hours to assemble just one car. Under those stamped aluminum body panels with carbon-fiber liners is an all-aluminum frame. In other words, it might look and even perform like a muscle car, but it’s built like a supercar.</p>
<p>For that kind of money, one would expect a top-performing vehicle. Considering Equus dropped an LS9, the same supercharged V8 used in the C6 ZR1 with 640-horsepower on tap, it certainly fit the bill. With the horsepower wars continuing to rage for now, that might not feel like as big of a number as it did seven years ago, but even by today’s standards it’s still impressive. Plus, the Bass 770 can rip from 0-60 in a claimed 3.4 seconds and hit 200 mph, proving it’s a real performer.</p>
<p>Speaking of supercars, the Equus Bass 770 featured an impressive array of tech. Yes, there’s a touchscreen infotainment center and electronic door handles, but the innovations go even further. For example, Brembo carbon ceramic brakes and a magnetic suspension provide greater control when pushing the car toward its limits. Even with all the innovations, the driving experience is kept pure with a six-speed manual gearbox.</p>

<p>If you’ve never seen the Equus Bass 770 in action, the video from Ridiculous Rides accompanying this article helps you sense what a performance machine it is. Sure, you’ll have to hear it all narrated by a British guy, which absolutely doesn’t jive with the American muscle scene, but the car can roast tires well enough.</p>
