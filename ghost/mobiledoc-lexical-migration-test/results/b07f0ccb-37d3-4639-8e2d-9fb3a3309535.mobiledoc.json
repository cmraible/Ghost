          "Porsche is a marque that has perhaps has the most engaged car enthusiasts in the world. Their strong and successful motorsport history dates back decades, and their cars express that heritage over the generations and current new car lineup. This 992 is the latest iteration of that,  and it shows across it's design, engineering, performance and technology. It almost seems like such a natural and obvious progression when having both these cars side-by-side, but the fact is so many manufactures have lost touch with what the end consumer is looking, for from an enthusiasts point of view. The manual transmission is a great example. It is no secret Porsche's PDK (automatic transmission) is a highly advanced transmission far superior than the manual, but it is not about what is better, but rather what the people want - at least as an option. Porsche remains very much \"open ears\" and I hope it continues that way for many more years. "
