<p>Friends:</p>
<p>For months, we’ve been laying the groundwork for an ambitious expansion. Now, we are thrilled to tell you about our first big step — <strong>and to ask you to </strong><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/607fdc544a4f550ff4a#/home"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong> to use this </strong><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/607fdc544a4f550ff4a#/home"><strong>special limited-time discount</strong></a><strong> that will help build out a full newsroom holding politicians accountable. </strong></p>
<p>First, the news: We are excited to unveil our <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">brand new website</a> at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/">www.dailyposter.com</a> — a big upgrade that we were only able to do thanks to free subscribers becoming paid subscribers. This is part of our expansion plan that aims to hire more reporters and do more accountability journalism on more topics. </p>
<p>That’s where you come in: We <strong>need</strong> you to become a paid subscriber right now. </p>
<p><em><strong>To encourage you to do that, </strong></em><a href="https://dailyposter.outpost.pub/public/promo-subscription/607fdc544a4f550ff4a#/home"><em><strong>click here</strong></em></a><em><strong> for a special discount off a Daily Poster subscription. It is available this week only.</strong></em></p>

<p>Taking advantage of this limited-time deal will score you access to all of the benefits of our new website. You get access to our podcasts, our live events, our new comments system, our upgraded subscriber-only content – and you get our brand new <a href="__GHOST_URL__/citizens-guide-to-holding-the-powerful-accountable/">Citizens' Guide To Holding The Powerful Accountable</a>.</p>
<p>As important, when you subscribe, you will be directly helping us do more of the journalism that has been holding politicians accountable on everything from the minimum wage, to climate change, to Medicare for All.

<p>The new website reflects our move from the newsletter platform Substack to Ghost, an open-source publishing platform. Now that we are on Ghost, we will be building a new and dynamic digital home that reflects our bold plans.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’s the most important thing to know about our new website: <strong>As a free subscriber, nothing has changed for you at all. </strong>You do not have to re-subscribe and you do not have to create a new account. You will still receive our regular emails. And you will still have access to public posts on our website.</p>
<p>For more information about our new site, including how to access your account and change your subscription plan, please check out <a href="https://the-daily-poster.ghost.io/faq-about-our-new-website/">this FAQ</a> that we prepared.</p>
<p>We hope you like our new digital home as much as we do. Now, to help us take the next step, please consider pitching in.</p>
