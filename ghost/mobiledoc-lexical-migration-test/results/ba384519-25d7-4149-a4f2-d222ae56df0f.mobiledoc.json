A closer look, however, demonstrates a rather amusing hiccup which perhaps points at the speed to which Nissan built this car to enter the Le Mans series. The speedometer only reads up to 170mph. Although never verified, the top speed for the road going car with its 3.5 liter V8 twin turbocharged unit allegedly could propel the car all the way to 220 mph.
