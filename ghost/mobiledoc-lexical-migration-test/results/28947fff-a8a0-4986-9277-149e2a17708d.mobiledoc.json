It was completely unbelievable that someone was so selfish they couldn’t just take the next exit, get back on the freeway going the opposite direction, then backtrack instead of putting everyone else near them at risk. Since then, this practice of suddenly cutting across multiple lanes to jump onto an exit ramp has become an all-too-common practice instead of something I see every once in a blue moon.

Some of the debris flew back and hit the camera car, but like we said that driver wasn’t seriously hurt. This couldn’t gone down much, much worse and we’re thankful it didn’t."
