In the past, their focus on consistent innovation led them to the top of Italy's performance automotive market and instilled an air of pride in their consumers. Models like the Berlinetta Pinin Farina paved the way for the performance aspect of the brand, but there is another car whose attention is mainly correlated with speed. That vehicle was known as the Maserati Mistral, which made a name for itself on the consumer market for its style and quickness. So what makes this wild little car so unbelievably desirable?",

Utilizing 3.7-liters of displacement, dual-overhead camshafts, and hemispherical heads, the powertrain can push out a whopping 250 horsepower and 283 ft/lbs of torque. Engineering gearheads will note that the optimal power to torque ratio for most performance cars is about 1:1. Despite this, many European sports cars completely ignore torque figures in favor of horsepower, which catches people's attention better. This car is all about reliable and usable power, which translates well to the track and the road.",
