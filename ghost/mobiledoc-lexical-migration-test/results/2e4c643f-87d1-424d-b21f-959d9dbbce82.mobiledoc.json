Instead of just a blacked-out appearance, the combination of Metallic Spark Black, Pearl Meteor Gray, and Emerald Blazed Green is appealing. This motorcycle presents well, but the dealer notes there are some scratches on the fairing and headlights, so it’s not perfect. The seat and controls look excellent, plus it’s rolling on new tires."
