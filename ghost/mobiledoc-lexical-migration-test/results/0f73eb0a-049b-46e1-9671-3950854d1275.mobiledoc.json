          "At about 12:25 am on December 24, two suspects stole a Lamborghini Urus from a residential driveway in Southwest Miami-Dade County, Florida. The victim, who was interviewed by the local news but asked not to be identified, expressed dismay that he was targeted for such a crime. Sadly, with the soaring price of cars, lax prosecution of vehicle theft, and other factors there is almost a feeding frenzy across the nation as crooks swipe cars all over."

This particular SUV has a nice custom paint job and wheels, the owner saying it’s worth approximately $300,000. With the keys left inside, the thieves only had to press the ignition button to get it started."

Many vehicles have a gate opener inside them, so once a thief is inside they can open the gate with ease. We’ve also seen crooks use a stolen car to ram through a secured gate."

While there are ways to break into garages, sometimes having your ride in there means potential thieves don’t even know it exists. Plus, there are steps you can take to physically lock the track for your garage door, ensuring even if criminals can hack your door opener that they can’t get inside."
