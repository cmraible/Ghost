Along with that, bigger brakes help bring this Charger get from 60-0 mph in 107 feet, and the improvements made to the acceleration, handling and braking allow the Charger Widebody to shave 1.3 seconds off the lap time around an unnamed 2.1-mile road course. Those are incredible performance figures for a 4,373-pound sedan that is essentially 15 years old, and it's made even more fun thanks to features such as launch control and line lock.
