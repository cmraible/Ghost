<p>So far the <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/winaZ51corvetteconvertible?promo=MOT25IMRRC">C8 Corvette</a> has been hailed as the fastest base model, the most beautiful ever made, and the first mid-engined ‘Vette. Unfortunately, it is also the hardest modern ‘Vette to get your hands on. For the 2020 model year, Chevrolet produced only half of what was planned and many of the cars were immediately snatched up by dealers and collectors who turned around and sold them for a huge profit. While everyone was hoping for 2021 to be a little better, it is actually not trending that way and as of the end of January, less than 5,000 <a href="https://racingarchives.tapkat.org/winaZ51corvetteconvertible?promo=MOT25IMRRC">2021 C8s</a> have been produced. These production delays that have carried over from 2020 have deprived even some of the biggest dealer’s lots of the new Corvette making it harder and harder to buy but who needs to buy one when you can win one?</p>
