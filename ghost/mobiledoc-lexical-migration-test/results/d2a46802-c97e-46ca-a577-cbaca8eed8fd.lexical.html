<h3 id="love-it-or-hate-it-electrification-seems-to-be-the-future-of-motoring">Love it or hate it, electrification seems to be the future of motoring.</h3>
<p>We're definitely in a strange place these days as automakers struggle between their heritage and their future. This has already resulted in upcoming vehicles such as the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Jeep/Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a> plug-in hybrid and the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/2021-ford-mustang-mach-e">all-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> crossover, and now <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/GMC">GMC</a> announced that it is reviving the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/vehicles/search/Hummer">Hummer</a> brand name for use on all-electric pickup truck that will be built in Detroit.</p>
<p>In an ironic twist, the GMC HUMMER EV could cater to the same crowd of EV lovers who bashed the company a decade ago.</p>

<p>The interesting part of this truck is looking back to just how much the Hummer brand was loathed by environmentalists with the oversized H2 standing as the catalyst for many debates. While Mach-E <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/ford-mustang-crossover">ruffled a few feathers</a> among Mustang lovers and classic car purists, it's possible this truck could stay true to Hummer's off-road heritage and still be an effective electric vehicle. Unlike the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/highlights/cybertruck-design-james-bond-lotus-submarine">Tesla Cybertruck</a>, the first teaser for this truck (shown above) clearly reveals that this new Hummer will keep a conventional pickup truck design, and the latest teaser shows an advanced front end with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gmc/videos/551586285762865/UzpfSTEwMjI3OTA1MTk2MDoxMDE1NjgxNzUxMjIwNjk2MQ/" rel="noopener">sequential lights in the grille</a> and LED headlights forming the Hummer brand's signature "H" motif. Only time will tell how EV, off-road and truck enthusiasts will accept the GMC HUMMER EV truck, but at least Jeep will finally be happy that Hummer the seven-slot grille!</p>

<p>Details are slim, but GMC did confirm that the Hummer EV will be a workhorse with an electric powertrain good for 1,000 horsepower and 11,750 lb-ft of torque, although neither figure has been SAE certified. It is also said that this truck will be able to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just three seconds. Perhaps the only confirmed detail about this truck is that it will be built at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant starting in the fall of 2021.</p>

<p>GMC's teaser commercial for the HUMMER EV truck aired during Super Bowl LIV, and the truck will make its official debut on May 20th.
