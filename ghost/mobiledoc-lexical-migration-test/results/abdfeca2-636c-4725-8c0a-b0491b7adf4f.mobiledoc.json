Because of that, the most prominent changes are only going to be graphics related but even that’s a sight for sore eyes and the game, in every other aspect, is quite frankly a masterpiece. The series is so much more than just gameplay and graphics and that is what makes me super optimistic about the HD version, and with all the information that we’ve seen, I am confident it's going to hit those right notes."
