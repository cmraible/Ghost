<p>Dodge may be absent from <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/thieves-steal-mike-harmon-racing/">NASCAR</a>, but the automaker has doubled down in terms of its dedication to <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/c8-corvette-dodge-demon-drag-race/">drag racing</a>, and that includes everything from professional NHRA teams down to grassroots racers. The 2021 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-dodge-redeye/">Dodge Challenger</a> Mopar <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/amc-collection-shows-some-true-muscle-car-drag-racers/">Drag </a>Pak is geared specifically toward the latter providing factory performance and build quality on a track-ready racer, but if you want one, you'd better have a good reaction time getting to your local Dodge dealership as only 50 of these cars are being built. The order books open up on September 9th.</p>

<p>Designed for sportsman racers, this Challenger has been upgraded for the 2021 model year starting with the engine. There's still a supercharged 354 cubic-inch Hemi V8 under the hood, but this engine gets a larger Whipple supercharger, upgraded forged internal components, new front accessory driver and an aluminum ice tank that cools the supercharger's intercooler. There's a new four-link rear suspension with equally new double-adjustable coilovers at all four corners, and all of these upgrades result in the "quickest, fastest and most powerful Dodge Challenger Mopar Drag Pak" that Dodge has ever built.</p>
<p>To ensure these Drag Paks are ready to slay the quarter mile, they are equipped with the latest in safety and performance equipment including an NHRA-certified roll cage and Mickey Thompson drag radials on 15x10-inch wheels (double beadlock wheels are available as an option). These cars also look the part with six available colors – White Knuckle is the standard color and the optional high-impact colors include Hellraisin, Pitch Black, Smoke Show, TorRed and Frostbite – as well as heritage-inspired graphics. To signify the low production numbers, each Challenger Mopar Drag Pak will have a serialized plaque under the hood and on the passenger side of the dash.</p>

<p>The 2021 Dodge Challenger Mopar Drag Pak goes into production early next year, and just like the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/ford-performance-reveals-all-electric-mustang-cobra-jet-1400/">Mustang Cobra Jet</a> and COPO Camaro, these cars won't last long. Only 50 of these factory drag racers are being built, and each will have a price starting at $143,485, which is a pretty good price considering the level of performance and collectibility this Challenger offers.</p>
