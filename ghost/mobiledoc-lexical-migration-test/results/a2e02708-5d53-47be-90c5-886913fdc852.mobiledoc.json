As you’ll see in the included video, a specialized scuba team working with a tow truck are able to extract the Chevy from its watery grave, removing a hazard to fish, boaters, and everyone living downstream."

Sure, some people always speculate the reason is insurance fraud, and that’s probably the case many times, but not always. As detailed in the video, this Corvette was reported stolen and the man who owned it no longer lives in the country. This might have been a case of insurance fraud, but it also could’ve legitimately been stolen, used to commit a crime or multiple crimes, then dumped. We’ll probably never know the whole story."

They work with two truck companies and city crews to remove cars sunk in bodies of water all over the United States."
