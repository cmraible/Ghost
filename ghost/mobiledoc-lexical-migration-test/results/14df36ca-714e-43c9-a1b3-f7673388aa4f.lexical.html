<p>In the new episode of our weekly podcast <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota is joined by <em>New York Times</em> global economics correspondent Peter S. Goodman to explore why <a href="__GHOST_URL__/tag/joe-biden/">President Biden</a> and the Democrats chose to side with railroad barons by forcing rail workers to accept a contract they had already rejected. They also dig into why the rail workers’ demand for additional paid sick days became such a sticking point in negotiations, and what a potential rail strike could mean for the U.S. economy (6:24).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="100%" height="180" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/1e38427a/dark"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
