<p>I’ve got back into <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> now I have a webcam for my work PC. However, my presentation skills aren’t always what they should be:</p>
<p><object height="353" width="425">
        <param name="movie" value="http://seesmic.com/Standalone.swf?video=gnhX85E1aA">
        <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" height="353" src="http://seesmic.com/Standalone.swf?video=gnhX85E1aA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent">
    </object></p>
<p>The service has been revamped somewhat since I last had a play, and the new view which compiles replies in the timeline makes it much easier to pick up interesting new conversations than it was before. It gets ever more interesting, for a service in Alpha.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
