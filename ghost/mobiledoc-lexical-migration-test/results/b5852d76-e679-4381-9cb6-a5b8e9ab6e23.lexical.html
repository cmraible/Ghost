<p>A great selection of links for you today. I've got a lot on my plate, so let's dive straight in, without my normal rambling:</p>

<h3 id="whats-up-with-whatsapp">What's up with WhatsApp </h3>
<p>This is potentially good news, especially in parts of the world where WhatsApp is responsible for most of the viral misinformation. If Facebook goes ahead with this, it will, essentailly, build <em>very</em> basic fact-checking tools into the app. It won't solve the problem, but every little counts.</p>

<h3 id="celebrities-are-starting-to-build-their-own-private-fan-communities">Celebrities are starting to build their own, private fan communities</h3>
<p>Fed up with being held hostage by platform algorithyms, celebs are using a mobile-centric direct community tool to build engagement instead:</p>
<blockquote>The appeal, as Washington hinted at, is control. After a decade of being at the mercy of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat—which own the data, the algorithm, and ultimately that direct line of communication to the audience—stars finally aren’t willing to suffer having these apps restrict access to their fans.</blockquote>

<h3 id="trollwatch">TrollWatch</h3>
<p>It turns out that Goodreads has become a haven for trolls, harassers and review bombing:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247279-in-the-black" rel="nofollow noopener">Goodreads</a> is currently experiencing one of the book review site’s largest-ever harassment campaigns as trolls spoof the identities of numerous authors in a coordinated attack against author <a href="https://www.patrickstomlinson.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Patrick S. Tomlinson</a>. The spoofed accounts use the names and photos of Tomlinson’s fellow authors to post negative and attack reviews on the Goodreads pages for his books.</blockquote>
<p>The site lacks basic verification and account safety features most others have. I suspect that the main app and website have been neglected, while Amazon works on integrating Goodreads with the Kindle. Have you noticed how integrated it is with the iOS Kindle app now?</p>

<h3 id="obligatory-tiktok-content">Obligatory TikTok Content</h3>
<p>This is another piece that's feeding into the longer TikTok post I'm working on. (Look for it in you inboxes tomorrow, with a bit of luck). We sometimes forget that some social channels are much better at building trust than promoting stories. </p>

<p>One of the endless stream of <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/collection/predictions-2020/">Nieman Lab prediction articles</a> (really, does any working journalism have time to read them all?), but this one resonates with me:</p>
