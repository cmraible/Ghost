After all, a lot of drivers have the impression all the safety features on their ride will protect them no matter what. Not only are they surrounded by instantly inflating airbags, they have a plethora of electronic nannies constantly squawking at them if they cross a lane line without signaling first, get too close to the car in front of them, or literally get out of line in other ways. That, combined with the ease of automatic transmissions, leave drivers feeling bored."
