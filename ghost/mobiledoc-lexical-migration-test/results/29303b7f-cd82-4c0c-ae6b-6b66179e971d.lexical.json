For our American readers, that’s about 124 mph in a 50 mph zone, so he was hauling. Even more importantly it was a kid who’s definitely not old enough to drive behind the wheel. Kids joyriding in cars they shouldn’t be driving is nothing new, but it’s more shocking when they get their hands on something a little more performance-oriented.",
