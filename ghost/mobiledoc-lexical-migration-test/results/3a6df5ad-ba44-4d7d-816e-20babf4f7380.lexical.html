<hr>
<p>If you haven’t seen the Cars and Zebras YouTube channel, and you love classic cars and drag racing, you are missing out. Especially in this latest video from the Pure Stock <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/watch-some-modern-muscle-cars-drag-race/">Muscle Car Drag Race</a> series where drivers line up their stock classic cars to prove who really made the best muscle car back in the day.</p>
<blockquote><em>Watch an old school versus modern muscle showdown <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/classic-modern-muscle-cars-race/"><em>here.</em></a></em></blockquote>
<p>This episode that was posted on February 20, 2021 featured two legendary muscle cars, a 1970 P<a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/5-things-gto-judge/">ontiac GTO</a> 455 and a 1969 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/coolest-cudas/">Plymouth ‘Cuda</a> 440. Both cars are icons in their own right but the GTO was clearly a better seller back in the day. With nearly six times more GTO 455s produced in 1970, there were only 340 ‘Cuda 440s made in 1969.</p>

<p>Based on the ‘Cuda’s build sheet, it is clear that the car was built for one thing, to go as fast as possible in a straight line. It features a rarely used 440-cid V8 engine rated at 375-horsepower, a TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission, a 3.91:1 rear gear ratio, and not much else. Thanks, in large part, to the lack of options such as power steering and power brakes, the ‘Cuda weighs in at 3,604 -lbs including driver. In case you are missing the theme here, Plymouth was clearly shooting for light and powerful.</p>

<p>This particular <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/research/1969-pontiac-gto/">Pontiac GTO</a> is powered by a 455-cid V8 rated 360-horsepower. Its turbo 400 3-speed automatic transmission is fairly well matched to the competitions transmission but the 3.55:1 rear gear ratio is slightly less appealing. With driver in seat, this iconic muscle car weighs in at about 4024-lbs.</p>
<p>Examples of both cars were thoroughly tested back in 1969 and 1970, respectively. According to Car Life testing a 1970 Pontiac GTO with a 455 and a 3.55 gears was capable of a 1/4 mile ET of 14.8 seconds @ 95.94 mph but Muscle Car Review said theirs ran 13.5 seconds @ 103.5 mph. Car Life’s 1969 Plymouth Barracuda Cuda 440 ran the 1/4 mile in 13.89 seconds @ 103.2 mph. So, this drag race seems to be a pretty fair fight, though judging by specs alone, it is pretty clear how it is gonna go. Not to spoil the ending but Mopar made one heck of a muscle car back in 1969.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZxYpW6pByM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html-->
