<hr>
<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/motorious-top-collector-site/">Here at Motorious</a>, we pretty much talk about cars all day long, be it during assignments, or discussions among ourselves. When posed with the question from our CEO, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/neil/">Neil Pitt</a>, about which car we would buy from the inventory for under $20k, the conversation got pretty interesting. Here's how it played out. </p>
<p>Neil shared his pick first, a 2004 Mazda RX-8, specifically, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/205456/2004-mazda-rx-8">this one</a>: </p>

<p>His rational was well-articulated, and is a mix of sentiment and logic, detailed as:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Near perfectly balanced weight ratio 50/50 left/right and front/back on a vehicle that when new was 10% the cost of exotic sports cars that aren't able to pull that off.</li>
    <li>Rotary Engine - Yes it's quirky and problematic but it is also quirky and problematic.</li>
    <li>Four doors on a "sports car" - Clam Shell doors are unique and almost functional.</li>
    <li>It was my youngest daughters first car so there is sentimental value and nostalgia tied to it.</li>
    <li>Zoom Zoom - German Engineering in a Japanese vehicle (predecessor the the new Z4?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Next to answer was our Associate Editor, Steven Symes. I would have picked a Tacoma for Steven, he's a vintage off-road guy, but he took it further and picked a <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/211631/1929-ford-model-a">1929 Ford Model A</a>, which seemed like an off choice at first. However, Steven then schooled us about the off-road culture and history with the Model A. </p>

<p>Is this not crazy? </p>

<p>So, lesson learned! </p>
<p>This one was tough for me to weigh in on. See, I'm a project car person, nothing goes unmodified in my house, so I start planning with every car I see. It got about an hour in before I had to cut myself off. Of the 93 pages of under $20K inventory on Motorious, I admittedly only got through about 7 in that hour, but I have a plan for each car on those first seven pages! </p>
<p>What I did land on (the first round, and we'll get to that), was a clean <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/211233/1997-bmw-m3-e36-supercharged">1997 BMW M3 E36</a>, if I had to just leave it alone. I figure, of all the cars, I can turn this car into some kind of race car, the easiest. So this would make a good little rally cars, wouldn't really need much - and replacement parts are pretty cheap and readily available at this point.</p>

<p>But if I could buy a $20K and the money I put into it didn't matter, we're playing a new game, and I could tell by this point that my team was already getting exhausted that I've started to break the rules. </p>
<p>Let's say I didn't have to disclose how much I'd spend, <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/206037/1965-chevrolet-nova">I want a Chevy II! </a></p>

<p>If the $10k in engine/trans swap plus another $5k in suspension I planned out to turn it into an autocross car doesn't count towards the cost, this is might pick. </p>
<p>Cam, our newest member brought the game back into the realm of reality, but his picks were many, so we're going to put them into a gallery.</p>

<p>Which opened it back up to everyone picking a few more cars for their league, and that's what Motorious did last Wednesday. </p>
