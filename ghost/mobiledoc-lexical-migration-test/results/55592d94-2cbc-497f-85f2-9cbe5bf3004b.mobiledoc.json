Under the hood is a swapped in 302 cubic-inch Ford Small Block engine, which is backed by a five-speed manual transmission with selectable drive modes and gearing ratios. It’s equipped with a detachable hard top that covers the full six-point roll cage and aftermarket bucket seats. The Bronco rides on an upgraded suspension, and Mickey Thompson wheels with Xtreme All Terrain tires make sure the SUV has full utility when driving off the beaten path."
