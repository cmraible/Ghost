While just having a great power to weight ratio isn't enough to call it faster than most modern Corvettes, because of gearing, suspension, and technology differences, it is enough to say that you won't find anything like it on today’s market. On top of that, you also get a very low-to-the-ground stance which is perfect for high-speed driving and a four-speed manual transmission to sweeten the pot. All together, this is one of the best Corvettes to ever come out of the late 1960s, which is exactly why you should consider this third generation Corvette for your next automotive purchase.",
