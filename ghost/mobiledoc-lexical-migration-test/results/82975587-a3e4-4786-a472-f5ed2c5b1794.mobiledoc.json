The guy got a hot tip on a bullet-ridden 1970 Pontiac GTO that was sitting in a junkyard in western Texas, deciding to place a bid on the thing. When he first checked, the top bid was $7 so he did the reasonably thing, bidding $200 and then forgetting all about it. A few days later he found out he was the proud new owner of the sad classic muscle car."

They probably figured he would be sensible and not pour a bunch of time and other resources into the Pontiac equivalent of Swiss cheese. You see, not only did someone shoot this GTO up, rust has claimed large sections of the body, so it’s in just awful shape."

Now, the guy at least had the sense to not try rehabilitating everything about this Pontiac GTO, which one could do but would likely spend a small fortune on the build. Instead, the man decided to just get it running so he could do Swiss cheese burnouts."

Check it out, because this video is more educational and entertaining than the slop you’ll find on Netflix. The guy uses a cargo strap to keep the doors closed and many other sketchy things, so you’ve got to see it for yourself."
