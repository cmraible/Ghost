Actually, they’re better than a time capsule, which might include some interesting items but nothing you can actually drive. Plus, they can teach you plenty about history none of your teachers thought should be included."

Plus, we see the interesting phenomena of people storing vehicles in haphazard ways, something we probably wouldn’t do, but it is pretty common. In other words, this is a relevant aspect of automotive history, of how people valued and treated cars they didn’t want to give up."

Among them is a Model T, a car so ubiquitous that many sadly just blow them off. There’s also a Bucket T hot rod, which is yet another automotive icon in its own rite."
