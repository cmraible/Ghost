This is the first of my liveblogged session notes from the event.*\n\n\n## Christian Röpke, CEO, ZEIT ONLINE\n\n![Christian Röpke](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/christian-ropke.jpg?resize=900%2C657&ssl=1 \"christian-ropke.jpg\")\n\n[*Die Zeit*](http://www.zeit.de/index) has a 500,000 paid circulation as a weekly newspaper – and their weekly nature means that they lack many of the problems dailies have in balancing print and digital operations. Their circulation is 10% digital, and is growing 30% year on year. Online they reach 11.4m uniques per month.\n\n35% of their audience in under 29 – higher than their competitors. It’s a stable figure – they’re young, but they want to get even younger. Why? Because you can’t just focus on today’s customers – you need to put effort into creating your future customers.\n\n### Four strategic aims\n\n1. **Quality advertising of premium reach** – display advertising isn’t dead – and as publisher we need to tell that story. Their business grew by 10% last year.\n2. **Digital circulation/paid content** – they’ve sold through apps, but now they’re adding paid content on the websites.\n3. **Classified offerings** – in niches (academic positions, top positions at NGOs)\n4. **Focus on millennials** – you can’t look at the future without looking at your future readers.\n\nThey’ve focused on mobile to reach millennials – and with mobile “cards” in particular – a design language that works for “flipping” behaviour for millennials. “We are not afraid of mobile”. Mobile display advertising is growing *strongly* for them.\n\n[![](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/img_5857.jpg?resize=960%2C680&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/img_5857.jpg?ssl=1)  \n Up until now *Die Zeit* has been sold as a single product, and *Zeit Online* was a separate thing – the print articles only hit the websites three or four weeks longer. They’ve now mixed the two in [the Z+ product](http://blog.zeit.de/fragen/2017/03/30/z-die-gedruckte-zeit-im-internet/).\n\nDigital-only and digital-and -print bundles are growing strongly – app store revenue is pretty much flat.\n\n### Targeting young readers\n\n[*Zeit Campus*](http://www.zeit.de/campus/index) – is a new editorial platform for students. It has a distinct design feel from the main part of *Zeit Online*, but it is still part of the wider product. Their first article – about ghostwriting of articles – went strongly viral. The key idea is *orientation* – helping students figure out what they want to *do* at university. They built an online tool to help people make those decisions.\n\nThey’re also reaching out to the younger demographic with events. event: [Z2X – the Festival of New Visionaries](http://www.zeit.de/z2x/) in Berlin for 600 people. It’s not a one-off – they’re doing series of them.\n\nAnd their launching niche sites. For example, [ze.tt](http://ze.tt) – launched in July 2015 and run by a small, separate team, based in a loft in Berlin. It targets the 18 to 30 year old demographic. They run recruiting events called “work & play”. These are at least partially gamified, so rather than “speed dating” potential employers or employees, you play escape room games with them.\n\n### Key lessons\n\n- Find your own fundamental laws on display, mobile and homepage traffic.\n- The homepage is **not** dead.\n- Keep adding and expanding business models,\n- Understand young readers\n- Understand your market position. They *choose* to be premium.\n\n\n## Analysis\n\nA couple of core points here:\n\n### Community development\n\nThe strategy for developing young, mobile readers is a classic community play:\n\n- Identify a target audience\n- Identify content that they will find useful\n- Develop that content\n- Give them a sense of involvement through distinct branding\n- Grow that out into events.\n\nThat creates an emotional/intellectual double whammy that builds loyalty to your brand – and that loyalty is more likely to convert into paid subscriptions, if you can prove value.\n\n### Income diversity\n\nLike many larger businesses, *Dei Zeit* is realising that there won’t be a single saviour business model that will enable transition to digital. A diverse range of business models targeting different sections of your audience is much more viable – and provides a greater safety net.\n\nNothing especially innovative in the ideas underlying the approaches shown here – but some good, thoughtful and sustainable execution.\n\n\n"
