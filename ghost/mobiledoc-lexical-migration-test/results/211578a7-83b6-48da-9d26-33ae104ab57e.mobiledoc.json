That’s why when he recently sounded the alarm against putting E10 fuel in classic cars, people paid attention in a way they haven’t before."

Cowland recommends for his fellow Brits to seek out Super Unleaded at gas stations like Esso. He claims some of the pumps don’t dispense fuel with any ethanol in it. The man says if he’s “out and about” where he’s not sure where ethanol-free fuel is available, his “safeguard” is Castrol Valvemaster."

          "We recommend doing some research before you just start filling up the tank on your classic ride. With E10 finally hitting the UK market in September of 2021, British enthusiasts are still adjusting to the change. Biofuels are supposed to help cut vehicle emissions, however they can be corrosive to certain gaskets, fiberglass, rubber, metals, and even plastics. Adding to the fun is the fact they can absorb water like crazy, meaning you get condensation buildup in fuel tanks if you keep your hobby car parked during the winter."
