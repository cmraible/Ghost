When he was about 12 his cousin returned from serving in the military and started working for General Motors. The cousin showed up at the Clark residence behind the wheel of a new Chevy Corvette, a sports car which absolutely transfixed the young man. At that point Tom vowed he would buy one after he graduated from high school. He did, snagging a 1964 convertible for just $1,500 in 1968. He’s also owned the highly sought-after 1963 split window and a 1966 convertible, saying the latter was his absolute favorite Corvette."
