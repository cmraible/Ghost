<p>Many car enthusiasts absolutely worship at the feet of <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-leno-1921-mercedes-benz/">Jay Leno</a> and religiously follow <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-lenos-garage-general-lee/"><em>Jay Leno’s Garage</em></a>. However, a recent episode <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/jay-leno-drives-a-1958-continental-mark-iii/">featured the comedian</a> talking about his very own 1996 <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-dodge-viper/">Dodge Viper</a> GTS, causing diehard Corvette fans and Ford GT owners to spin their heads while spewing pea soup out of their mouths. We’re totally joking: you can like all three cars and that’s great. But this little episode which we’ve attached to this article for your viewing enjoyment seems to have triggered more than a few people.</p>
<p>Admittedly, when you’re as famous as Leno you’re just going to attract trolls – we know that well enough. But, for some the Big Three rivalry is life and can never, ever be set aside. Why can’t we call just be happy America makes sports cars which <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/dodge-viper-still-moving-new-cars/">embarrass the Europeans</a>? That should be absolutely unifying, everyone.</p>
<p>Anyway, as should be expected, Leno’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/low-mileage-1996-dodge-viper-gts-seeks-fun/">Viper GTS</a> looks absolutely stunning. The guy has a sizable staff to lovingly care for his sizable car and <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/features-3/keanu-reeves-motorcycle-collection/">motorcycle collection</a>. Plus, he’s the first and only owner, so no doubt this Viper GTS has lived a more luxurious life than most of us.</p>
<p>Leno goes into his philosophy of why he’s a fan of first-generation cars like the Viper and the Mustang. The man makes some good points, but you don’t have to agree with him. For example, there are good reasons to like the fifth generation Vipers. But, there’s some irony in this statement since the 1996 GTS coupe is considered a second-generation car by many, even though it was the first production year of the coupe. Obviously Leno sees it differently, but like we said, you don’t have to agree with everything the man says or does.</p>
<p>What’s really cool about this Viper GTS Coupe is that everyone at the factory signed the engine when Leno toured the facility and took delivery of the car. It’s a neat extra and will make this vehicle unique for generations to come.</p>
