Remarkably, it doesn't look like extensive body modifications were required for this Dino to achieve Safari status, but it was beefed up with a redesigned front bumper with exposed driving lights and custom clevis mounts. The rear of the car received a similar reinforced bumper, custom fiberglass mud flaps and that totally awesome whip antenna! Custom 15-inch steelies were created for this build, and they come wrapped in somewhat meaty VR-rated tires allowing this Dino to balance traction and high speeds."

The increased ride height was accomplished from coilover shocks, and the increased ride height helps make the Dino's long wheelbase look more palatable. That long wheelbase is a product of this car's 2+2 design, but this 308 Dino GT4 was equipped with the rare factory-delete rear seat option. This might be the only Ferrari out there with a CB radio, and for racing purposes, it's also equipped with four-point racing harnesses and a fire extinguisher."
