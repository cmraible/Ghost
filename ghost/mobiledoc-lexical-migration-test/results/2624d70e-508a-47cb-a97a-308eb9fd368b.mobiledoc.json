Sure, they say it can be scaled quickly, but those are just words, not actions. Can automakers truly supply enough batteries to grow EVs into even 10-percent of annual vehicles sales? There’s serious doubt they can. However, governments around the world seem to think they can decree such a thing and it will happen. Those laws and regulations don’t solve the battery supply issue or the key questions about generating enough electricity to keep those cars charged, let alone building the infrastructure for conveniently charging them on the go.
