<p>What are these cars, why is there so much controversy, and where are they today?</p>
<hr>
<p>Now known internally at Motorious as the ‘Corvette no one can agree on’, the 1963 Corvettes with the earliest VIN numbers have captivated the entire team. It goes without saying that 1963 Corvettes can stand on their own four wheels, but the first 23 (or possibly up to 25) of these cars have presented a level of mystery we haven’t unearthed before from a mass produced year model.</p>
<p>Despite all of the mid-engine Corvettes falling off lifts, being sold for well above price tag, and crashing, they are no longer the Corvette headline for 2020; that title goes to a trio of Corvettes that sent us down a major rabbit hole of research when they came up for sale. </p>
<p>At the mention of the subject of a pre-production, prototype, or Pilot Line Corvette, you can bet we’re talking about some rare real estate in the automotive collection market. So let’s factor in a rare year/model, which you probably already have the year in mind. A quick Google search of “rarest year Corvette” will agree with you that it’s the 1963 Corvette. Now, factor in the extremely few early-production Corvettes that exist, and the 1963 year, and you have unicorn on your hands, if you can find one.</p>
<p>The moniker “Sting Ray” was introduced in 1963 on the Corvette, as Chevy wanted to elevate the Corvette on its ten year production anniversary. Representing a new era in Corvette history, these were almost entirely different than the generation prior. </p>
<p>This move positioned the Corvette as a hit with the public, with 10,000 convertibles, and about as many hardtops sold. The split window only lasted one year, and that unique design characteristic only boosts the 1963’s collectibility.</p>
<p>Corvette history is rich and well-documented, but parts of it become highly debatable, especially in the earlier years. The documentation kept in the era that the 1963 Corvettes were produced was not exactly the same as it is today. Before the days of live streams, press sites, and every person in the world carrying around a recording device, official documentation relied on paper, clerks, production counted by hand, and (sometimes vague) marketing materials. Some cars and models are clearly documented, while others leave room for debate.</p>
<p>Following The Cookie Crumbs</p>
<p>With the lack of documentation, and experts having a hard time agreeing on much (we'll get to that later), we found ourself piecing together little things to make the bigger picture more digestible. </p>
<p>According to an interview with Pete Vacari, the production cars and earliest-production cars share some pretty significant differences. The early 1963 Corvettes body panels are build on a mahogany wood buck and handmade fiberglass. Having handmade parts, instead of the production tooling is a significant thing to note about pre-production Corvettes.</p>
<p>“The consoles are different, and the handbrake is a 1962 Chevy Nova handbrake. The clock is different, the glovebox doors are different, and the carpet is correct for the 1962 Corvettes.” says Pete Vacari, he continues, “ I could go on and on, but when you start looking at it, there’s a lot of features which are not in the production cars.”</p>
<p>Another tidbit about these cars to prove there was something a little different about the early VINs can be seen in a video featuring engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov himself, at a day of testing with legends Dick Thompson and Dave MacDonald.</p>
<p>The outing served, "to evaluate a Sting Ray convertible and a Sting Ray fastback – two prototypes which reflect a full decade of sports car experience.” When one of the cars pulls up after the test lap, a tech can be seen working with 'Knock-Off' wheels, or wheels made for quick take-off. For several reasons, these wheels did not make it to the official production of the car, eluding to the fact that, at least some, of the pre-production/prototype/pilot Corvettes could be destinquished as having different wheels. </p>
<p>Outside of being striking and photographing well in promotional photos, there’s a reason the pre-production Corvettes were painted red. Unlike other cars, imperfections have the hardest time hiding on a red painted car. Another key piece of evidence of pre-production authenticity is the lack of the Corvette cross flags on the valve covers. These rough-around-the-edges imperfections, or differences, in the exterior and interiors of these cars is an unconventional reason they are special, and it substantiates their validity as pre-production Corvettes.</p>
<p><strong>The 1963 Corvette Asterisk</strong></p>
<p>Name Controversy - What's In A Name?</p>
<p>What are these cars, exactly? The consensus on that term is not settled, and what this means is not agreed upon in the Corvette world. The paperwork and articles referring to the initial Corvettes produced under the 1963 design seem innocent enough, but digging deeper, the lack of definitive information makes the situation more mysterious. </p>
<p>There are many references to the early 1963 cars as being ‘Pilot’ cars, or what would commonly be call as the 1963 Corvette Pilot Line. As it turns out, there were no actual Pilot Corvettes in 1963, according to Larry Galloway, a Quality Engineer at GM during the time these Corvettes were being made. Curiously enough, literature shared with us by the GM Heritage Center, for our reference only, so we're unable to share the exact documents, shows that there is internal documentation calling these calls 'Pilot' cars. There's also marketing material from GM that again makes the 'Pilot' reference. </p>
<p>What starts to throw up even more questions is that the C2 Corvettes were in production on the St. Louis assembly line, but photographs show a handful of 1963 bodied Corvettes at the Flint Pilot Plant. However, there are no records of 1963 Corvettes being produced at the Pilot Plant, so what were they doing there? Which is what has prompted some to call these cars ‘Prototypes’ after the photographs were released by the photographer’s grandson in recent years.</p>
<p>What the ‘Pilot Line’ reference is said to represent is the pre-production 1963 Corvettes that were built. To add another phrase to the mix of ‘pre-production’ and ‘Pilot Line’ is the term ‘prototype’ that has become the third way to represent these 21, special Corvettes.</p>
<p>So, what is the correct name for these cars? Good luck getting anyone to agree on that. </p>
<p>Call it a ‘Pilot Line, ‘pre-production’, or ‘prototype’, the Corvettes these terms cover started rolling down the assembly line first, so from here on out, we're sticking to early-production cars, just to place it safe.</p>
<p>Production Controversy </p>
<p>What to call these cars is only part of the controversy. The belief is that while the 1962 Corvettes were still in production, 1963 Corvettes were on the same line. Historical factory photos actually show a 1963 Corvette being painted at the Flint Pilot Line plant, with the clearly visible double headlights of a 1962 directly behind it, but does that even mean anything? According to some, no, it doesn't.</p>

<p>While there were 23 bodies in registry, Vicari notes that there are several blank spots. He explains that this seems to indicate very few that you could actually drive, with the rest never making it to the road. According to Vicari, only 8 or 9 of the 23 have been discovered to be complete cars.</p>
<p><strong>Where are they now? </strong></p>
<p>Virtually all of the 21 (23, or 25, depending on who you ask) pre-production 1963 Corvettes were convertibles, and only a handful are known to still exist today. Regardless of the number that made it to the road, it's generally agreed upon that there are no more than 8-10 still around. </p>
<p>The current accepted, or agreed upon, information shows that there are two pre-production 1963 Corvettes in California (one being VIN #18), another in North Dakota, VIN #18 is in Alabama, and there’s a split window coupe in England.</p>
<p><strong>Information specific to the cars for sale:</strong></p>
<p>How about finding three of the only 23 ever made? Or better yet, three with sequential VINs, that’s something most car collectors can only dream of, even they can even image the possibility to begin with. Factoring in these three key elements, this trio of 1963 Corvette Prototypes, or Pilot Line Corvettes, and it’s the true holy grail of auction cars. The red convertibles with fuel injection-fed engines are all privately owned in Louisiana, and are on the auction docket for the upcoming Vicari Auction’s Cruisin’ The Coast.</p>
<p>The Louisiana trio of 1963 Corvette Prototypes are all red ‘Verts, restored to pristine condition and feature VINs #15, #16, and #17. In the 120 historical photographs taken to document pre-production life for the 1963 Corvettes, one distinct photo shows VIN #16. On the inside of the car, a firewall panel has both the VIN number and body tag, it was the only one in the series that shows both.</p>
<p>While the photo found of the VIN and body tags was not clear enough to read, a photo taken during a restoration in 2014 lines up perfectly with the black and white one, and it’s undeniably the same plates, in the same position, with the same characters on the plates, same visible scratches besides the VIN tag, and same filler smear on the firewall - this is about conclusive as photo evidence gets.</p>
<p>While the pre-production trio is three convertibles, it’s worth mentioning that the split-window aspect of the 1963 hardtops is the most notable distinction of maybe any Corvette year/model, ever. </p>
<p>Vicari’s VIN #15, #16, and #17 Corvettes are all convertibles, and #15 was only delivered with a soft top and didn’t have a hardtop, while the other two wore two tops. Cars #15 and #17 were both restored while owned by Pete, and #16 had already had a complete frame-off restoration.</p>
<p>Pete Vicrai’s Corvettes are from the era of Corvette testing that was spearheaded by Zora Duntov. Dick Thompson and Sam McDonald were filmed testing a coupe and convertible in a track. When the cars pulled up, the convertible can be seen as having two-prong wheels, where the production cars had three - one of these cars was pre-production! Although it doesn’t elude to be a Pete Vicari owned car in the video, there’s a three in seven chance it just may be.</p>
<p>While Pete Vicari has clearly invested a lot of time, money, and research on the trio, it’s time for them to find a new home. Pete, and any other blood blooded enthusiast, would love to see these cars stay together. Owning one of these cars would be extremely rare, but owning three is a chance you’ll likely only get once-in-a-lifetime.</p>
