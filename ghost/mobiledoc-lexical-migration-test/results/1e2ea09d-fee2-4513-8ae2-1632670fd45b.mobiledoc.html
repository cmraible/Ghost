<p>You'd be forgiven for thinking that <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/criminals-steal-chevy-camaro/">garage door</a> technology peaked somewhere around the time that Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Garage door openers are pretty simple, <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/buying-salvage-c8-corvette/">all things considered</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, though, LiftMaster has taken the simple <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/curse-of-dodge-challenger/">garage door opener</a> a step further. To show off the technology, they've directed an ad featuring a famous face.</p>

<p>The ad starts out in a familiar setting – Cameron Frye's house from Ferris Bueller. Specifically, the garage.</p>
<p>The door opens to reveal a beautiful red E-Type Jaguar. A kid tells his friend that it's a 1966 and that "his dad spent three years restoring it." Hey, we've heard that before.</p>

<p>The actors and the car may be different, but otherwise, it's a faithful, shot-for-shot, line-for-line recreation of one of Ferris Bueller's Day Off's most memorable scenes. LiftMaster even licensed Yello's "Oh Yeah."</p>
<p>They stick to the established script right up until the Ferris Bueller stand-in says "It's his fault he didn't lock the garage." Then we see the LiftMaster garage door opener and its integrated camera.</p>

<p>We also hear a familiar voice offering a stern warning – "Don't even think about it!" The shot cuts to Alan Ruck, reprising his role as Cameron Frye, watching the events unfold on his cell phone.</p>
<p>"Been there, done that," he says, as what is revealed to be his son walks of with his friend. It's a fitting tribute to one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's also a pretty memorable ad for a slick new garage door opener.</p>
