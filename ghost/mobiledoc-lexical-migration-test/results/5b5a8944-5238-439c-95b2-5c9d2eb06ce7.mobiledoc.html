<p>Finished in a bold yellow, this beautiful '69 Stingray was given a restoration and is ready for a new place to call home. Open the doors to an immaculate black interior that perfectly contrasts its brilliant exterior. </p>
<p>For the 1969 model year, engines offered was a standard 350-cubic-inch V8 engine with an output of 300-horsepower. Another option was a modified 350-cubic-inch small-block V8 capable of 350-horsepower. This year also had several 427-cubic-inch big-block engines to choose from including a 390-hp option, a triple two-barrel that made 400-hp, another triple two-barrel with aluminum heads good for 435-hp, and the aluminum-head <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/1967-sunfire-yellow-l88-corvette/">L88</a> that generated 430-horsepower that wasn't recommended for the street. These engine options were covered by a special high-doomed hood.</p>
<p>The ZL1 Corvette would be stuffed with one of the rarest engine options ever - an all-aluminum version of the L88 that was 100 pounds less and rated at 430-horsepower. However, the actual output was an impressive 550-horsepower. The car dominated the quarter-mile in 11.2 seconds in at 127 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The standard transmission was a fully synchronized 3-speed manual. Other options included two fully synchronized 4-speed manual transmissions and an automatic Turbo Hydra-Matic.</p>
<p>More features and options offered on the '69 model included Posi-traction rear end, a 15-inch wide oval rubber, improved 4-wheel disc brakes, new anti-interference ignition system, and a side-mounted exhaust system. </p>

<p>These cars were originally given away back in 1989 after a VH1 sweepstakes gave them all to one winner. Pop artist Peter Max then purchased the entire collection from the winner with a plan of using each one as a canvas for an art project that was never started. The cars were left covered in decades of dust and collecting rust in parking garages across the Big Apple. All have been recovered and each one were taken in for a full restoration with each one going home to a winner in the Lost Corvettes Giveaway. So go ahead and make a donation to The Lost Corvettes with the promo code here and be entered into win the 1969 Chevrolet Corvette of your dreams! Your donation will benefit the National Guard Educational Foundation.<br></p>
