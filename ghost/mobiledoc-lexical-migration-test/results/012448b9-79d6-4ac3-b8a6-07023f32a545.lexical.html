<p>Friends:</p>
<p>We have some big news to share today: Thanks to our subscribers’ support, <em>The Daily Poster</em> is officially expanding — and to reflect our new scope, we have a new name: <em><strong>The Lever</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Soon we will relaunch our website at <a href="https://www.levernews.com">LeverNews.com</a>. In the meantime, we have terrific hires to announce below, and we are posting several new job openings.</p>
<p>I am incredibly excited about this news, but before I explain all the details, let me make one thing crystal clear:</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to do anything or take any action — nothing changes about your subscriber status. All of the stuff you like about our reporting will remain the same. You will still get our daily reporting in your inbox (albeit under a new name) and our paying subscribers will still have all the same exclusive privileges.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the time being, we will still be at <a href="__GHOST_URL__/"><strong>dailyposter.com</strong></a> and you can still reach us at <a href="mailto:editor@dailyposter.com"><strong>editor@dailyposter.com</strong></a> — the name shift and website change will happen seamlessly in the next few weeks.</strong></p>
<p>OK, now onto why I’m excited, and why you should be, too: This expansion is the culmination of months of planning, and it could only happen because thousands of you have become paying subscribers.</p>
<p>When we started <em>The Daily Poster </em>more than a year ago, we had a vision of not merely creating just another newsletter with some hot takes. Instead, we aimed to create a fully operational news organization that holds politicians and corporations accountable — and we hoped that we would find an audience of readers willing to support that work.</p>
<p>That hope has become a reality — and so now it’s time to invest and expand, so we can make an even bigger impact.</p>
<p>Let me answer three questions I know you’re curious about:</p>
<p><strong>1. Why are we becoming <em>The Lever</em>? </strong>When we started out, we really were daily posters, but we now do much more than that. We have live events, exclusive features, and a Citizens’ Guide, and we are planning to relaunch a regular podcast in the coming weeks. All of this work is designed to hold the powerful accountable <strong>—</strong> which is why we believe <em>The Lever</em> is a much more accurate moniker for our work. We hold accountable the people moving the levers of power. We believe fearless journalism can create leverage that forces politicians to fulfill their promises. To paraphrase Archimedes: We believe that with a strong enough lever, we can help move the world.</p>
<p><strong>2. Who are we hiring? </strong>Thanks to our subscribers’ support, we have just hired two full-time journalists: reporter Matthew Cunningham-Cook and associate editor Aditi Ramaswami. I first worked with Matthew on <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/chicago-teacher-pension-money-invested-rahm-emanuels-friends-donors-1843104">financial investigations</a> at <em>International Business Times</em>, and you may recognize his byline from <em>The Intercept</em>. You likely already know Aditi’s <a href="__GHOST_URL__/author/aditi/">byline</a> from her work over the last few months here at <em>The Daily Poster</em>. They are great additions to our growing team.</p>
<p><strong>3. What job openings do we have?</strong> Right now, we are looking for a senior reporter, a podcast and virtual event producer, and a social media/audience engagement manager. While our new website is still being built, you can find these job listings at <a href="https://www.levernews.com">LeverNews.com</a>. Please share these job listings with anyone you know who might be interested in applying.</p>
<p>I’ll confess that these big steps come with some anxiety and sleepless nights. It’s always a risk to try to change and expand. But I know that the crises we cover are too big to just rest on our laurels. So we’re taking a leap to try to move our work to the next level. It’s a gamble, but with your continued support, I’m confident this is going to be a big success.</p>
<p>As I said above, all of this news is thanks to you, our subscribers. We absolutely could not do this without you. Together, we are building a new kind of media outlet — one that is supported by readers, and focused on holding the powerful accountable.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our team. Stay tuned for more news on this expansion in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Rock the boat,</p>
<p>Sirota</p>
