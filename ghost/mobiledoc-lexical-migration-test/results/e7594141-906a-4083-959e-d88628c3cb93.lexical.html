<p>Racing is dangerous, even on a track loaded with safety precautions, a car loaded with safety devices, and a trained professional behind the wheel. After all, to go faster and shave that extra tenth or hundredth of a second off your time, it’s necessary to push the envelope. Still, hearing about the death of a beloved television star is shocking. Understandably, many in the car world are mourning right now.</p>
<p>The official Street Outlaws account on Twitter shared the following message: “The <em>Street Outlaws</em> family is heartbroken by the accident that led to the tragic death of Ryan Fellows. We extend our deepest sympathy to Ryan’s loved ones as they process this sudden and devastating loss.”</p>
<p>Back in January, JJ Da Boss and his wife Tricia Day collided during a race while filming an episode of <em>Street Outlaws</em>. Day’s car ran into a production van and she was left with injuries serious enough to require hospitalization. Thankfully that incident didn’t turn out worse. Now they mourn a costar who wasn’t so lucky.</p>
