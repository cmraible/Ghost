It’s not every day you see a ’68 Charger with 1,000-horsepower on tap, or one that costs about $200,000. Yes, this build is ridiculous, but it hits hard and is unbelievably clean, making it absolutely captivating."

Everyone wanted one of the mills despite the steep price of $29,995. According to David, he called and called to order one, leaving over 30 voicemails before someone finally called him back. They then asked if he wanted the Hellephant and the guy was ready to just shove his money in their hands."

The guy certainly isn’t alone in that respect as many think of it as the quintessential American muscle car, even among the non-car folks. If you’re going to drop this kind of cash for a crate motor, the wise thing would be to put it in something which looks the part."
