Typos, inaccuracy and howling crimes against grammar and syntax probable.*\n\n\n## Stefan Plöchinger, Digital Editor, Süddeutsche Zeitung and Editor in-Chief, SZ.de\n\n![Stefan Plöchinger](https://i1.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/Stefan-Plöchinger-1600x1253.jpg?resize=922%2C722)\n\nWho are [Süddeutsche Zeitung](http://www.sueddeutsche.de)? They are the paper that got [the Panama Papers](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/).\n\nTheir subscription model has now surpassed the ad model – he’s happy, because he doesn’t think that the ad model is sustainable.\n\nPaid content is a politicised discussion in Germany. However, their adoption of a paywall is not a political statement – it’s just what they *need* to do. They have a *great* growth curve – which he shared with us (including figures), but which he didn’t want shared.\n\nTheir paid content model is an agile paywall for SZ Plus. Basic news is free. It’s a commodity. You get 10 bylined articles from staff per week for free. Beyond that, there’s a premium paywall – subscriber-only content – and once you’re subscriber you get the epaper edition, too. It’s complicated, but they don’t need to explain it to the readers – because it just works.\n\nAll in subscription for €34.99.\n\n> The journey to a successful subs model. [@ploechinger](https://twitter.com/ploechinger) of Süddeutsche Zeitung explains. Delighted that they work with Content Insights [#DME17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DME17?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/cBDC02OUjd](https://t.co/cBDC02OUjd)\n> \n> — Content Insights (@InsightsPeople) [April 26, 2017](https://twitter.com/InsightsPeople/status/857176683421552640)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n\n## Content strategy in the floorplan\n\n> Honest comment by [@ploechinger](https://twitter.com/ploechinger) on layered newsroom at [@SZ](https://twitter.com/SZ) \"It's crap, we hate it\" [#DME17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DME17?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/fGpQA60tFp](https://t.co/fGpQA60tFp)\n> \n> — Carl-Gustav Lindén (@Gusse) [April 26, 2017](https://twitter.com/Gusse/status/857178517758509056)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\nThey’re in a tower block with (relatively) small floors, so they have to be really creative with setting.\n\nFor example, the social media, homepage and managing editors sit adjacent to each other. They have a Textmarketing expert – but what does she do? She identifies the probably bestsellers in the articles they publish – and then she promotes them big time, on every channel that is possible and reasonable.\n\nAn agile editorial model:\n\n![an agile editorial model](https://i2.wp.com/www.onemanandhisblog.com/content/images/2017/04/Agile-editorial.png?resize=799%2C447&ssl=1 \"Agile-editorial.png\")\n\nThey’re constantly surprised by what stories create subscriptions – this model allows them to continue doing that. They’ve torn down the wall between editorial and publishing (but not ads), to make sure everyone is working together to generate subscriptions.\n\nThey drive conversions with premium, evergreen content, with social sharing and with rebundling content around key dates or events.\n\n###  Premium\n\n> If SZ notices an evergreen premium story that has staying power it will repromote to sell subs. Here stories on death, TV show [#DME17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DME17?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/u1ZFTYI780](https://t.co/u1ZFTYI780)\n> \n> — Joseph Lichterman (@ylichterman) [April 26, 2017](https://twitter.com/ylichterman/status/857179887018405888)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n### Facebook\n\n> SZ will also use Facebook to target premium stories to interested users. Like Bon Jovi? SZ will target its interview with him to you [#DME17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DME17?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/tCKnhoLI22](https://t.co/tCKnhoLI22)\n> \n> — Joseph Lichterman (@ylichterman) [April 26, 2017](https://twitter.com/ylichterman/status/857180227994308608)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n### Rebundling\n\n> Rebundling old articles helps to offer added value on subscriptions says [@ploechinger](https://twitter.com/ploechinger). Reminds me of cover supps back in the day [#DME17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DME17?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/WQtUSQTR7Q](https://t.co/WQtUSQTR7Q)\n> \n> — Jon Wilks (@jonniewilks) [April 26, 2017](https://twitter.com/jonniewilks/status/857180509092409345)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n\n\n"
