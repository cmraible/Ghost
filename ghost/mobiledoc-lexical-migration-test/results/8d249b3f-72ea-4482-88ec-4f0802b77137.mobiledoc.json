This latest edition of his discovery is no different as he heads off a well-traveled road to find a collection of cars that have been hidden under the public’s nose for a very long time. After making a contact at a car show in North Carolina, he learned of this collection, and is eager to get cameras in to do some exploring."

Most of the some odd 80, or so, classic cars in the clearing are nowhere near salvageable or running. There’s a C3 Corvette body that pops out, and lots of pre-1960s American cars here."

Another oddball, a Custom C/20 Deluxe with one door on the driver’s side, and two on the passenger’s side, is something not many people have ever seen. A lot of other cars in the open field are debatable, as far as what one would consider ‘salvageable’, but there are a lot of very rare cars."
