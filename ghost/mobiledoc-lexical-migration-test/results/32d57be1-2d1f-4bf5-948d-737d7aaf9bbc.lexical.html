<p>Usually, when you have serious damage on a car the best thing to do is call a tow truck and hire a professional to fix it. Sometimes people might risk driving the vehicle themselves, although we don’t recommend it. In the video posted to Instagram by account americanmusclehd, a modern Dodge Challenger was taken onto the highway even though it’s crabbing or dog tracking something fierce.</p>

<p>Just watching the video we wince in pain. It’s about as bad as the time I saw a woman in a Mustang (with California plates) trying to make it up a steep mountain pass in a snowstorm by pressing the accelerator all the way to the floor. Her rear tires were smoking as they uselessly spun on the icy road, her pony car going nowhere.</p>
<p>At least this Dodge Challenger is moving, but should it be? We’re taking a shot in the dark here by guessing frame damage is likely the cause, although it could be something else pretty serious. Driving a car with that kind of a problem at any speed, but especially over 55 mph is just asking for trouble in a big way.</p>
<p>This video was taken in the Atlanta area. We’re not going to judge all Georgians based on this, but what’s in those peaches these days?</p>
<p>The problem of cars crabbing or dog tracking certainly isn’t new, if you haven’t ever seen it before. A quick Google search will pull up all kinds of videos and photos showing Ford Explorers, Chevy Silverados, and other vehicles looking like they’re driving sideways. On vehicles with a live rear axle, it can be an issue of thrust angle.</p>
<p>But the modern Dodge Challenger has a five-link rear suspension, so that’s why we’re guessing this muscle car has some pretty serious frame damage. It could be an alignment problem, a really bad alignment problem. How could the driver not notice something is off?</p>
