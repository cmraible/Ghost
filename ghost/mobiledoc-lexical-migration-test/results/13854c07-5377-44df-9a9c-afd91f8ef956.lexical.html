<p>The classification <a href="https://www.privatecollectionmotors.com/vehicle-details/used-1979-lincoln-continental-mark-v-1-owner-4k-original-miles-costa-mesa-ca-id-39344609">of a car</a> as a so-called “land yacht” requires a few prerequisites to cement the vehicle in its certification as such. For one they are always big, extremely heavy, and have long wheelbases. However, the qualifications for these archetypes of asphalt need not all be bad. For instance, many of the big and heavy boats of yesteryear also came equipped with <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/experience-full-sized-luxury-in-this/">luxury</a> beyond its time. This led to the term “Land Yacht” which better expresses the car's focus on luxury and style. One of the most prolific manufacturers of these <a href="https://www.privatecollectionmotors.com/vehicle-details/used-1979-lincoln-continental-mark-v-1-owner-4k-original-miles-costa-mesa-ca-id-39344609">behemoths is Lincoln</a>, they have always made quite the name for themself because of the brand's focus on comfort and commodity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.privatecollectionmotors.com/vehicle-details/used-1979-lincoln-continental-mark-v-1-owner-4k-original-miles-costa-mesa-ca-id-39344609">The personal luxury coupe</a> from the Lincoln division of the Ford Motor Company only had a few years in production, and this 1979 Lincoln Continental Mark V is a perfect example from the run.
