<p><a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/rarest-porsches-ever/">Porsche started with the new 993-generation</a> 911 chassis which featured a new multi-link rear setup. This new rear setup allowed the 993 chassis to remain stable under the larger amounts of power made by the outgoing 964-generation 911 Turbo’s engine and drivetrain. Modifying the body, Porsche then widened its rear wheel arches to Turbo specification and fitted it with a rear spoiler from the 964 Turbo S. In all, Porsche only made 14 examples of this highly collectable and little known 993 Turbo Cabriolet.</p>

<p>As a world-leading authority on 1960s-era Shelby American automobiles, Stephan Becker Automotive Group has offered some of the most collectible Shelby cars over the years but <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/original-1968-shelby-gt500/">this 1968 Shelby GT500 convertible</a> might be close to topping the list. Only 402 convertibles were made in 1968 and this car sits exactly how it did when it rolled off the lot. Thanks to spending most of its life in Arizona, It has never been restored. It is believed to have only 86,000 actual miles put there by its 3 known owners. Most of the mileage was more than likely racked up by the second owner who owned the car for 34 years.</p>

<p>Take this fully restored <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/handpicked/win-a-1969-chevy-camaro-now/">LeMans Blue 1969 Chevelle SS 396</a>, that is currently being offered at the OK Classics February 2021 Classic Car Auction through Proxibid, for example. Though to the untrained eye it may look pretty close to original, it is not. Under the hood is a 402-cid V8 engine that breathes deeper, fires hotter, and makes more power than the original 396. It has been fitted with a Holley 4V carburetor, an Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold, and a Comp Cams CB-270H camshaft. This combination of parts produces an estimated 360-horsepower. Supporting all of the newfound power is a GM HEI Distributor with MSD ignition wires, an Edelbrock high volume fuel pump, a set of Hedman ceramic coated headers, and an M20 Muncie 4-speed transmission with a Hurst shifter.</p>
