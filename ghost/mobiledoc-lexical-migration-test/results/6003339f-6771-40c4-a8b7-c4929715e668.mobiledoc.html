<p>Republicans are back on their hobbyhorse of trying to make the federal government as ineffectual as possible, and this week‚Äôs podcast offers everything you need to know on the matter. On <em>Lever Time</em>, David Sirota sits down with <em>ProPublica </em>journalist Jesse Eisinger to explore the importance of U.S. tax policy in a way that even your conservative uncle can understand. With a looming battle brewing over the debt ceiling, David and Jesse discuss how Republican-led efforts to defund the IRS might actually come to pass. <em>The Audit</em> is still on hiatus, so now is a great time to catch up on their first two mini-seasons.</p>
