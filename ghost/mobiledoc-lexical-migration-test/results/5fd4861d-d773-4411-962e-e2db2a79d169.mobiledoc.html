<p>We found <a href="https://buy.motorious.com/vehicles/209736/1969-chevrolet-corvette">this 1969 Chevrolet Corvette coupe</a> in the Motorious Classifieds at Chicago Car Club. <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/550hp-corvette/">Early C3s</a> are desirable, but they don't always have to be expensive.</p>

<p>The car seen here is only $20,500, and from the photos, it doesn't look half bad. Sure, the trim and upholstery are beginning to show their age, but this appears to be a driveable, enjoyable classic that would benefit from an eventual restoration.</p>
<p>It also helps that this isn't the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/articles/news/win-this-1969-camaro-pace-car/">most desirable</a> variant, either. It's a pretty basic 350/automatic combination, but that's still more than enough to have some fun. Besides, it has side pipes and shiny blue paint. What more could you want?</p>

<p>We'd enjoy this car as a fun summer cruiser, taking time here and there to work on small projects to improve the car. We'd want to address the drivetrain, brakes, and suspension first to make sure everything is up to snuff. Thankfully, these cars are relatively simple to work on.</p>
<p>Then, we'd take care of the interior and collect fresh trim to install after an eventual repaint. We'd probably have the car repainted over the winter, while it was too cold, snowy, and salty to drive the car anyway.</p>

<p>Early C3 Corvettes have a classic look that's hard to resist. Given how inexpensive these small-block cars can be, it's worth looking into if you want a classic car with a budget under $25,000.</p>
<p>We doubt that C3 Corvettes will become the next aircooled Porsche in terms of appreciating values. However, you shouldn't let that stop you from enjoying one of the best-looking iterations of America's Sports Car.</p>
