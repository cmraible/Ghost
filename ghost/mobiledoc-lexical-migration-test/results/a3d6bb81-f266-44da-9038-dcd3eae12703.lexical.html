<p>This Batcycle is built on a 1967 Yamaha 175. That’s key because in 1966 when the original debuted on the famous TV show it was created using a Yamaha YM1. Naturally, both motorcycles have been heavily modified to make them appear technologically advanced, because Bruce Wane and his sidekick friend wouldn’t be caught dead riding on something normal.</p>
