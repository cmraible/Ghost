All of these models received a design that was distinctive from the standard Mustang without being too extreme. These cars all got sportier front and rear bumpers, a larger rear wing, louvered side scoops, subtle C-pillar trim and upgraded five-spoke wheels with high-performance tires. Inside, Saleen Mustangs have unique leather shift knob, 200-mph speedometer and a gauge pod on top of the dash with boost pressure and intercooler water temp gauges. All cars get serialized plaques on the dash and under the hood as well as a serialized bumper number."

For better handling, the S-281 gets a \"racecraft\" suspension with Saleen-tuned variable-rate springs, struts, rear shocks and front sway bar, but the ultimate version is S-218SC. The \"SC\" of course stands for the Roots-style, intercooled supercharger, which along with a special engine computer tune bumps the car's output to 350 horsepower – a base Mustang GT had 285 horsepower, while the factory Cobra bumped power output to 320 horsepower."
