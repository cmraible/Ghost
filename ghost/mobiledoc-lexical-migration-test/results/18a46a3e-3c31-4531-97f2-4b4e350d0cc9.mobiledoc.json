More specifically, without spoiling too much, towards the end of the game, you're required to play around with the game's files. On PC, this was incredible as it actually required the player to go into their computer's folders and make changes to files related to the game. However due to the nature of consoles, this is non-existent, so the workaround was to build a makeshift PC operating system (OS) emulated through the game and have you clicking through menus there. It works, it still gets the same idea across but when you're altering files on what's clearly not an actual PC, the meta doesn't quite have the same effect."

It walks along an artistic tightrope that, on the one hand, you want to be as faithful to the artist's intentions as much as possible but on the other, can be a tad insensitive to the issues at hand. The warning at the start of the game makes it very clear about its content and that it should not be consumed by children or by anyone who may find the content to be emotional triggering (likely for legal purposes but I'll give the benefit of the doubt here) and yet, I still couldn't help but feel once all was said and done that some matters could have been handled with a little more sensitivity."

Even though you know something scary is about to happen, it still makes each hair stand up on end when it does. The psychological horror will likely double your heart rate and as the plot progresses, you won't know what to believe to be real. As is not surprising, the workarounds for the console version are respectable and the developers did what they could, but the ports were inevitably not going to be the definitive versions. Play this game on PC if you can but if you're unable to, you'll still have a wonderful time in the literature club on Switch."
