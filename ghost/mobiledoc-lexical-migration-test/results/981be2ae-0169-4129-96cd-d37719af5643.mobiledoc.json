That’s the same engine used in Spitfire fighter planes during WWII, so to wedge something like that into a car is quite the feat. John Dodds, the eccentric builder of this creation, got the idea to use such a ridiculous engine when a customer of his requested that he build a three-speed automatic transmission which would bolt up to an airplane engine."
