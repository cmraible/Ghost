<p>So, we finally have it. <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/138938416772/160208-accountswitching">Instagram now supports account switching</a> from within the app. This is, of course, fantastic news for anyone who is managing a site’s Instagram account while trying to use the app for personal reasons, too.</p>
<p>Up until now they’ve been left with some variation of logging in and out, or having two phones. Instagram has never been very API-friendly. Those clunky approaches are a thing of the past, and that’s great news, I’m in the process of launching the web presence of a new venture – and it’s making my life easier from day one.</p>
<p>I’m not going to go other the details of how it works – that’s been well covered elsewhere. There are good guides on <a href="http://www.imore.com/how-use-multiple-accounts-instagram-iphone">iMore</a> and the <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/instagram-multiple-accounts">Buffer blog</a>.</p>

<p>I’m more interested in one specific detail of the account switching process. Here’s a screenshot of the process mid-switch:</p>

<p>All you do is press (quite firmly) on the user logo in the bottom right of the screen, and you switch accounts.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can go to your profile screen, and just click on the menu at the top.</p>

<p>Tap on the account you want to switch to, and you’re away. It’s much simpler and more intuitive than other apps that allow account switching – like Twitter, for example, where the account switching mechanism feels clunky every time I use it. There, you have to go to the profile page, and hit a specific button. The almost universal availability of the switching mechanism – without making it too easy to accidentally switch – shows an attention to detail that’s characteristic of Instagram. They only add new features <em>very</em> slowly, and when they do, they tend to get them right.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
