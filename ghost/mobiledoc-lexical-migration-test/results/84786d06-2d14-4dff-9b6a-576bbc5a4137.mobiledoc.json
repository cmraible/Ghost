Even though it looks a little rough, the guy who sold it to Collins proudly declared that it will start and run, something which shocked the celebrity barn find sleuth. Such things aren’t givens in his line of work. Just the catch was the brakes didn’t work, making getting the car onto a trailer a little bit trickier. This is why a winch is an essential item for anyone wanting to get into this line of work."
