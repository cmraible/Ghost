That’s right, much like how the C8 Corvette is one tough cookie to crack, the new pony car will be almost impossible to hack, if you’re to believe a recent report from Fox News."

In other words, if they can’t use the might of the US legal system to stop you from tweaking your Mustang, they’ll just use technology to block you."

Sure, if you get the GT then the 5.0-liter Coyote V8 pumps out 480-horsepower, but to squeeze anything more out of it will require the kinds of computer skills it would take to steal a Tesla. Same thing goes for the Mustang Dark Horse."

The silver lining is Ford supposedly is working with aftermarket companies to provide “approved” parts and tunes by next summer. Boy, we can hardly wait to see what those cost, because surely with Ford controlling access to such things it will be super affordable (that’s sarcasm for anyone lacking a sense of humor)."
