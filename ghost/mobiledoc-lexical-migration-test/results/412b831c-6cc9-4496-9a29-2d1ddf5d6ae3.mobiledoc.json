The whole thing was exposed on September 3 at about 3:15 pm when a guy in a Dodge Durango pulled over an off-duty officer from the department was driving his personal vehicle on i-76 between Bridge St. and Bromley Ln. That’s right, the wanna-be cop pulled over a real one but didn’t realize it, which happens more often than you’d think."

This guy reportedly had red and blue lights mounted on his Durango, a big no-no, tried to stop the off-duty officer, then started brake checking the non-compliant actual member of law enforcement. Then the guy in the Dodge forced the cop off the road and did a traffic stop."
